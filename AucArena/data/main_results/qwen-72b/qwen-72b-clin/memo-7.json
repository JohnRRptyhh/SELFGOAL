Bidders SHOULD BE PREPARED to raise their bids significantly to remain competitive, as demonstrated by Bidder 2's $300 increase.\n3. Early withdrawal from the auction MAY BE A STRATEGY for bidders to conserve resources or reassess their maximum bid, as seen with Bidder 3 and Bidder 1.\n4. Placing bids too close to the current highest bid, like Bidder 4's $2100, DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE effectively to winning, as it can be easily surpassed.\n5. Making substantial bid increments, like Bidder 4's $600 increase, MAY BE CONTRIBUTE to successfully displacing other bidders and discouraging immediate counterbids.\n6. Observing competitors' bidding patterns IS CRUCIAL for understanding their strategies and determining the optimal time to bid or withdraw.\n7. Bid increments SHOULD BE PROPORTIONAL to the current bid to deter swift counterbids and maintain a competitive edge.\n8. Withdrawing after placing an initial bid MAY INDICATE a lack of interest or insufficient preparation, potentially signaling other bidders to pursue the item more aggressively.\nLearnings:\n-\nLearnings:\n-\nLearnings:\n-\nLearnings:\n-\nLearnings:\n-.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nLearnings:\n-.\nLearnings:\n-.\nLearnings:\n-.\nLearnings:\n-.\nLearnings:\n-.\nLearnings:\n-.\nLearnings:\n-.\n"},"arms":{"Bidder 1":{},"Bidder 2":{},"Bidder 3":{},"Bidder 4":{}},"model_info":{"Bidder 1":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 2":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 3":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 4":"qwen-72b"}}
