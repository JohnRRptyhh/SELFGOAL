Having multiple bidders can lead to increased competition and higher final prices, as seen in the case of Doodad D.\n2. Bidders may retract their bids, indicating the importance of flexibility and adaptability in bidding strategies.\n3. Starting bid prices can significantly affect the final hammer price, with higher starting prices potentially attracting fewer but more committed bidders (e.g., Mechanism J).\n4. Bid increments should be carefully considered, as large jumps may discourage competition (e.g., Bidder 4's $2400 bid on Doodad D after Bidder 2's $2200 bid).\n5. Bidders who consistently withdraw may indicate a lack of interest or a more selective bidding approach, suggesting their preferences or budget constraints.\n6. The hammer price may not always reflect the true value of the item, as seen in Doodad D and Widget A, where the final bid was lower than the perceived value.\n7. In a multi-bidder situation, patience can be crucial, as waiting for other bidders to withdraw can lead to a more favorable outcome (e.g., Bidder 4 winning Widget A).\n8.

Then, update the status JSON regarding the following information:\n- 'remaining_budget': The remaining budget of you, expressed as a numerical value.\n- 'total_profits': The total profits achieved so far for each bidder, where a numerical value following a bidder's name. No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}. If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format.

Having multiple bidders can lead to increased competition and higher final prices, as seen in the case of Doodad D.\n2. Bidders may retract their bids, indicating the importance of flexibility and adaptability in bidding strategies.\n3. Starting bid prices can significantly affect the final hammer price, with higher starting prices potentially attracting fewer but more committed bidders (e.g., Mechanism J).\n4. Bid increments should be carefully considered, as large jumps may discourage competition (e.g., Bidder 4's $2400 bid on Doodad D after Bidder 2's $2200 bid).\n5. Bidders who consistently withdraw may indicate a lack of interest or a more selective bidding approach, suggesting their preferences or budget constraints.\n6. The hammer price may not always reflect the true value of the item, as seen in Doodad D and Widget A, where the final bid was lower than the perceived value.\n7. In a multi-bidder situation, patience can be crucial, as waiting for other bidders to withdraw can lead to a more favorable outcome (e.g., Bidder 4 winning Widget A).\n8.

Starting bid prices can significantly affect the final hammer price, with higher starting prices potentially attracting fewer but more committed bidders (e.g., Mechanism J).\n4. Bid increments should be carefully considered, as large jumps may discourage competition (e.g., Bidder 4's $2400 bid on Doodad D after Bidder 2's $2200 bid).\n5.

Starting bid prices can significantly affect the final hammer price, with higher starting prices potentially attracting fewer but more committed bidders (e.g., Mechanism J).\n4. Bid increments should be carefully considered, as large jumps may discourage competition (e.g., Bidder 4's $2400 bid on Doodad D after Bidder 2's $2200 bid).\n5.

Starting bid prices can significantly affect the final hammer price, with higher starting prices potentially attracting fewer but more committed bidders (e.g., Mechanism J).\n4. Bid increments should be carefully considered, as large jumps may discourage competition (e.g., Bidder 4's $2400 bid on Doodad D after Bidder 2's $2200 bid).\n5.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid.

Bidders may retract their bids, indicating the importance of flexibility and adaptability in bidding strategies.\n3. Starting bid prices can significantly affect the final hammer price, with higher starting prices potentially attracting fewer but more committed bidders (e.g., Mechanism J).\n4. Bid increments should be carefully considered, as large jumps may discourage competition (e.g., Bidder 4's $2400 bid on Doodad D after Bidder 2's $2200 bid).\n5. Bidders who consistently withdraw may indicate a lack of interest or a more selective bidding approach, suggesting their preferences or budget constraints.\n6. The hammer price may not always reflect the true value of the item, as seen in Doodad D and Widget A, where the final bid was lower than the perceived value.\n7. In a multi-bidder situation, patience can be crucial, as waiting for other bidders to withdraw can lead to a more favorable outcome (e.g., Bidder 4 winning Widget A).\n8.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid.

You can use them to guide this auction:\n```\nLearnings:\n-\nLearnings:\n-\nLearnings:\n-1. Having multiple bidders can lead to increased competition and higher final prices, as seen in the case of Doodad D.\n2. Bidders may retract their bids, indicating the importance of flexibility and adaptability in bidding strategies.\n3. Starting bid prices can significantly affect the final hammer price, with higher starting prices potentially attracting fewer but more committed bidders (e.g., Mechanism J).\n4. Bid increments should be carefully considered, as large jumps may discourage competition (e.g., Bidder 4's $2400 bid on Doodad D after Bidder 2's $2200 bid).\n5. Bidders who consistently withdraw may indicate a lack of interest or a more selective bidding approach, suggesting their preferences or budget constraints.\n6. The hammer price may not always reflect the true value of the item, as seen in Doodad D and Widget A, where the final bid was lower than the perceived value.\n7. In a multi-bidder situation, patience can be crucial, as waiting for other bidders to withdraw can lead to a more favorable outcome (e.g., Bidder 4 winning Widget A).\n8. Identifying and tracking bidder behavior can provide insights into their bidding patterns and help inform future strategies.\nLearnings:\n-1. A competitive environment with multiple bidders MAY BE NECESSARY to drive up the final auction price.\n2. Flexibility in bidding strategies SHOULD BE NECESSARY to adapt to other bidders' actions.\n3.
