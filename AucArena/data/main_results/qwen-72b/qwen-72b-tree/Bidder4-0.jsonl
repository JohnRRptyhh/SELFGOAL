Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Bid Strategy Development: Develop a bidding strategy that allows you to bid conservatively on items with a high estimated value relative to their starting price, while avoiding overbidding and exhausting your budget too early.\n - Budget Management: Allocate your budget efficiently across the items, ensuring that you have enough funds to bid competitively on high-value items even if they have high starting prices.\n - Risk Assessment: Assess the risk of overestimating or underestimating the true value of an item and adjust your bids accordingly. Be prepared to drop out of bidding if the price exceeds your estimated value.\n - Competitive Analysis: Observe and analyze the bidding patterns of other bidders to identify their preferences, budget constraints, and potential thresholds. This can help you predict when to bid and when to hold back.\n - Patience and Discipline: Exercise patience, waiting for the right opportunities to bid, and maintain discipline to avoid getting caught up in bidding wars for items with lower profit potential.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"As Bidder 4, you have a total budget of $20000.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid.

Allocate the remaining budget to prioritize high-value items, like Appliance O, Utensil N, and Mechanism J, which have estimated values of $8800 or more.\n - Risk Management: Be cautious with items that have similar estimated values, like Utensil N and Mechanism J. If you win one, it might limit your ability to bid competitively on the other. Consider bidding more aggressively on the item with the higher perceived value or the one with fewer potential bidders.\n - Set bid limits: For each item, determine a maximum bid based on your estimated value. For example, for Appliance O and Utensil N, you might set a limit around $8,500 to $8,600, leaving a buffer in case your estimate is too low.\n - Anticipate competition: If you notice that other bidders have a similar estimated value for high-value items, be prepared for bidding wars. In such cases, you might need to be more aggressive, but don't exceed your pre-determined bid limit.\n - Diversify risk: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your bids across multiple items to minimize the risk of losing out on all high-value items due to aggressive competition.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Appliance O:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $4500\n- Bidder 2: $4500\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $4100\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $4900\n\nRound 2:\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

If the bidding goes beyond your estimated value, it could lead to a loss. On the other hand, if you don't bid, you might miss out on a high-value item.\n\nFinal Decision:\nI bid $3100! This initial bid shows your interest in the item while leaving room for gradual increases if necessary. It's a strategic move to test the waters and see if the competition is high or if you can acquire the item at a reasonable price without overextending your budget.

You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - High-Value Item Focus: Since you have a significant portion of your budget left, prioritize bidding on the high-value items (Unit Q, Machine P, Mechanism J, and Element R) where your estimated values are $11,000 or $8,800.\n - Bid Aggressively on High-Value Items: If you believe an item's true value is close to your estimate, be prepared to bid more aggressively to secure it, especially if you have a strong advantage over other bidders in terms of remaining budget.\n - Bid Ceiling for Unit Q and Machine P: Set a maximum bid of $10500 for each, leaving a buffer of $500 in case the true value is higher or bidding competition is intense.\n - Bid Ceiling for Thingamajig C: Set a maximum bid of $2100, allowing for more aggressive bidding if the value is low.\n - Market Value Estimation: As the auction progresses, try to refine your estimated values based on the winning bids and the reactions of other bidders. This can help you make more informed decisions about when to bid and when to withdraw.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Unit Q:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $6000\n- Bidder 2: $5500\n- Bidder 3: $5500\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value.

Be prepared to adjust your bidding accordingly if you encounter them again.\n - Budget Allocation: Allocate your remaining budget wisely, focusing on high-value items while ensuring you have enough funds for the most valuable ones.\n - Profit Maximization: Always keep the overall profit in mind. If winning a high-value item would significantly deplete your budget, consider whether the potential profit is worth the risk.\n - Save a buffer for the end: Keep a portion of your budget for the last few items, as the competition might be more intense, and you want to be able to bid competitively on high-value items.\n - Monitor Your Profit Margin: Keep track of your profit margin after each bid. If you start to see a significant decline, it might be a sign to become more cautious with your bidding.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Machine P:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $6000\n- Bidder 2: $5500\n- Bidder 3: $5500\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

This could be when the bid is just below your estimated value or when you sense that other bidders might be reaching their budget limits.\n - Estimate True Value Adjustments: Given that Gadget B was won at $1200 but had a true value of $2000, it suggests that some items might be undervalued.
