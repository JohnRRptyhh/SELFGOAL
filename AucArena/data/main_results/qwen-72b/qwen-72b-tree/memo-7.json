Be more selective in the items you bid on, especially if it means overspending or bidding on items with lower profit potential.","1":"Contraption I: Consider the true value of $6000, which is higher than your winning bid of $3500. This indicates a successful purchase. However, it also means you have less budget for the remaining items.","2":"Machine P: Starting at $5000, this item has a high estimated value of $11000. If you can afford it without compromising your ability to bid on Utensil N, consider bidding, but be cautious not to overextend yourself.","3":"Gadget B: With a starting price of $1000 and an estimated value of $2200, this item is less valuable compared to Utensil N and Machine P. If you miss out on the higher-value items, Gadget B could be a backup option if the bidding stays within your budget.","4":"Apparatus H and Implement G: Both have estimated values that are closer to their starting prices. If you have extra budget after bidding on Utensil N and Machine P, you can consider these items, but prioritize them lower than the higher-value items.","5":"Risk Assessment: Consider the risk associated with each item. If the risk of overpaying is high, it might be better to conserve your budget for more promising opportunities.","6":"Bid Gaps: Observe the bid increments made by other bidders. If they are consistently bidding in small increments, it might indicate they are trying to conserve their budget or are unsure of the true value. Use this information to your advantage by bidding strategically.","7":"Anticipate Bidding Wars: If you notice other bidders are more likely to bid on specific items, consider whether it's worth engaging in a bidding war or if it's better to conserve your budget for other opportunities.","8":"New Bid Thresholds: Set new maximum bid limits for each item based on the revised estimated values, with a buffer to account for potential competition.","9":"Risk Assessment: Since Machine P has a starting price of $5000 and has already reached $6000 in the auction, it's a high-risk item due to the potential overestimation of its value. Consider the risk carefully before bidding, as the true value might not justify the price.","10":"Patience: If Machine P surpasses your bid ceiling, be patient and wait for the next item, Implement G. Focus on that item, as it aligns better with your remaining budget and estimated values.","11":"Implement G: The fine-grained goal is to bid assertively but within reason. Start bidding just above the starting price, and gradually increase your bid as needed. Keep an eye on the bidding patterns of the other bidders, especially Bidder 1, who has shown a willingness to bid aggressively on high-value items. If the bidding exceeds $4,500, weigh the potential profit against the remaining budget and adjust your strategy accordingly.","12":"Budget Management: Allocate the remaining budget of $6,000 wisely between Machine P and Implement G, considering the potential profit and risk associated with each item. If one item's bidding becomes too competitive, be prepared to shift your focus to the other item.","13":"Risk Assessment: Keep in mind the bidding history, where Bidder 2 and Bidder 3 seem to be less aggressive, and Bidder 1 has shown a tendency to bid high on valuable items. Consider Bidder 1 as a significant competitor when deciding how much to bid on Machine P.","14":"Machine P: {'Goal': 'If you win Utensil N, focus on Machine P as the next priority, but be cautious with your budget.', 'Guideline': 'Since Machine P has a high starting price, bid conservatively to begin with. If the bidding stays within your estimated value, gradually increase your bid, but be prepared to let it go if it exceeds your budget or if the bidding becomes too aggressive.'}","15":"Implement G: {'Goal': 'If all previous items are not won, Implement G is the last priority.', 'Guideline': 'Bid cautiously, as it has the same estimated value as Apparatus H. If the bidding for Implement G is low, it could be a good opportunity to maximize profit with the remaining budget.'}","16":"Risk Assessment: Given your current winnings, it's crucial to balance risk and reward. Since you've already made significant profits, be more risk-averse with the remaining budget. Avoid bidding on items where the potential profit margin is small or where the bidding could exceed your estimated value.","17":"Patience: Don't feel compelled to bid on every item. If the bidding for Utensil N or Machine P becomes too high, be prepared to let them go and conserve your budget for future opportunities or potential last-minute deals.","18":"Risk Assessment: Assess the risk of each item in terms of the potential difference between your estimated value and the true value. Focus on items with a higher margin of safety to minimize the risk of losing money.","19":"Budget Allocation: Adjust your budget allocation strategy to ensure you have enough funds for the higher-priority items with the revised estimated values.","20":"Patience and Discipline: Maintain discipline in not overbidding, even if it means losing some items. Focus on the items where you can still make a significant profit with the revised estimates.","21":"Endgame Flexibility: Be prepared to adjust your bidding strategy if your remaining budget allows for more aggressive bidding on certain items as the auction progresses.","22":"Bid Increment Strategy: Determine a bidding increment that allows you to stay competitive without overpaying. For instance, if the current bid is close to your adjusted estimated value, increase your bid in smaller increments to test the waters and see if other bidders drop out.","23":"Re-evaluate Estimated Values: Given that you've won Widget A and Element R at prices higher than your initial estimates, it's essential to re-evaluate your estimated values for the remaining items. Consider if your initial estimates were too low or if the market dynamics have changed.","24":"Adjusted Value Calculation: For each item you've won, calculate the adjusted value: Widget A: $2000 - ($1300 - $2000) = $2700, Element R: $11000 - ($5100 - $10000) = $10900, Mechanism J: $8800 - ($4900 - $8000) = $8700, Appliance O: $8800 - ($4600 - $8000) = $8700, Contraption I: $6600 - ($3500 - $6000) = $6700","25":"Remaining Budget: You have $600 left, which is not enough to bid on the next item, Machine P, with a starting price of $5000.","26":"Priority Reassessment: Given your adjusted values and remaining budget, you should prioritize Implement G, as it has a starting price of $3000 and an adjusted value of $6600. Machine P, with a higher starting price and a similar adjusted value, is less feasible given your current financial situation.","27":"Budget Allocation: With a remaining budget of $600, prioritize Implement G as it has a high estimated value relative to your remaining funds. Allocate a significant portion of your budget for this item, but don't exceed your estimated value.","28":"Bid Start: Begin with a bid of $3100, which is slightly above the starting price. This will signal your interest without immediately pushing the price too high.","29":"Value Adjustments: If the bidding exceeds $6000, which is your adjusted value considering the potential deviation from your estimated value, be prepared to withdraw. This will help you preserve your budget for potential opportunities in the remaining items.","30":"Endgame Focus: As you have only one item left to bid on, your primary focus should be on Implement G. If you win it, your overall profit will depend on the difference between the adjusted value and your winning bid.","31":"Priority List: Rank the remaining items based on their adjusted values and the potential for profit. Focus on items with the highest adjusted value and profitability.","32":"Re-evaluate item priorities: With the items that have already been auctioned, you've secured some high-value items. Analyze the remaining items and prioritize those with the highest estimated value relative to their starting price and your remaining budget.","33":"Avoid bidding wars: Try not to get caught up in bidding wars, especially if it pushes the price beyond your estimated value. Remember, the goal is to maximize profit, not just win items.","34":"Loss Mitigation: Given that you've slightly overbid on Widget A and Element R, it's crucial to avoid overpaying for the rest of the items. Be more cautious with your bidding, especially on items with lower estimated values.","35":"Avoid Gadget B: Given its low estimated value, it's not worth bidding on Gadget B, especially considering your remaining budget and the potential for higher profits with other items.","36":"Evaluate Each Bid's Impact: Before increasing your bid, consider the potential impact on your overall profit and remaining budget. If winning an item might leave you with a very small budget for the rest of the auction, it might not be worth the risk.","37":"Be Prepared to Let Go: If the bidding exceeds your maximum bid limit, don't hesitate to withdraw. Remember, the goal is to maximize overall profit, not to win every item.","38":"Risk Management: Given the lower budget, be more cautious with items that have a higher risk of overestimation. For Gadget B, with an estimated value of $2200, consider bidding conservatively, perhaps around $1500, to minimize potential losses.","39":"Machine P: Since your estimated value for this item is $11,000, you can afford to bid aggressively up to around $9,900 (90% of your estimated value). However, given that the starting price is $5,000, you should monitor the bidding closely. If the bidding stays below $6,000, you can enter the auction with a bid of $6,100 to potentially trigger a bidding war. If the bidding starts to approach your aggressive limit, be prepared to incrementally increase your bid, but don't exceed $9,900.","40":"Implement G: With an estimated value of $6,600, you can bid up to around $5,940 (90% of your estimated value). If the bidding remains low, you can enter around $3,300, which is a significant increment from the starting price of $3,000. Monitor the bidding and incrementally increase your bid as needed, but don't exceed your aggressive limit.","41":"Budget Consideration: With a remaining budget of $4100, be cautious in bidding to ensure enough funds for higher-priority items. Balance spending to maximize profit.","42":"Risk Assessment: Given the bidding history, it seems that other bidders are more cautious or have withdrawn. This could mean they have reached their budget limits or are focusing on different items. However, be prepared for potential competition, especially if an item has a high estimated value for another bidder.","43":"Contraption I: Given that you've already won it, consider the potential for resale value and profit. If the bidding for Utensil N or Machine P becomes too aggressive, focus on maintaining your profit margin with Contraption I.","44":"Apparatus H and Implement G: If you miss out on the high-priority items, these medium- and low-priority items can be considered as alternatives. Bid conservatively, as their estimated values are similar to Contraption I but might require more budget management.","45":"Bidding Guidelines: {'Bid conservatively': 'Start with bids slightly above the starting price, but not too close to your estimated value, to avoid overpaying early.', 'Bid incrementally': 'Increase your bid in small increments to test the waters and see if other bidders are still interested.', 'Set maximum bid limits': 'For each item, set a maximum bid based on your adjusted estimated value, considering the potential true value and your remaining budget.', 'Be prepared to walk away': \"If bidding exceeds your maximum bid or the item's adjusted estimated value, don't hesitate to withdraw.\", 'Learn from past bids': 'Analyze the bidding patterns of other bidders and adjust your strategy accordingly.'}","46":"Estimate Adjustments: Review your previous bidding behavior and adjust your estimated values if necessary. If you consistently overbid, consider reducing your estimated values by a small margin to account for your bidding aggressiveness.","47":"Risk Assessment: Given the low budget, Bidder 4 should prioritize items with a lower starting price and a higher estimated value relative to the starting price. Implement G seems to fit this criteria, but the bidding should be strategic to avoid overextending the budget.","48":"Bid Strategy: For Implement G, Bidder 4 should consider bidding just enough to outbid the competition while staying below their estimated value of $6600. This will minimize risk and maximize potential profit.","49":"Opportunistic Bidding: If Bidder 1 or other bidders drop out early in the bidding for Implement G, Bidder 4 should seize the opportunity to secure the item at a lower price.","50":"Avoid Bidding Wars: Given the limited budget, Bidder 4 should not engage in bidding wars, especially with Bidder 1, as it could lead to overspending and potentially negative profits.","51":"Post-Auction Analysis: After the auction, Bidder 4 should analyze their performance, learn from their bidding decisions, and adjust their strategy for future auctions based on the outcomes.","52":"Bidder 2: Has won items with moderate values, showing a preference for items with a good balance between starting price and estimated value. They might be more cautious with their bidding. Monitor their interest in Implement G, as it could be within their bidding range.","53":"Track Bidder Thresholds: Note the price points at which other bidders withdraw, as this can help you predict when they might drop out in future rounds.","54":"Item Preferences: Observe if any bidder shows a pattern in the types of items they bid on (e.g., high-value, low-value, specific categories). This can help you predict their interest in the remaining items.","55":"Risk Assessment: Consider the risk of overbidding, especially if you notice a bidding war emerging. Be prepared to walk away if the price exceeds your estimated value, even if it means losing to a more aggressive bidder.","56":"Manage risk: Be more cautious with the remaining items. If the bidding exceeds your estimated value, be prepared to withdraw to avoid potential losses.","57":"Budget Allocation: With a remaining budget of $600, prioritize bidding on items with the highest potential for profit while ensuring you don't exceed your budget. Gadget B and Implement G seem to be the most feasible options given their starting prices and your estimated values.","58":"Bid Aggressively but Strategically: Since other bidders have been less active, you may need to bid more aggressively to secure the items you want. However, be cautious not to overbid, especially for high-value items like Machine P, as it could lead to a bidding war.","59":"Learn from Past Mistakes: In the case of Unit Q, you withdrew after Bidder 1 bid $5500, which was within your estimated value. In the future, consider bidding more aggressively on items with high estimated values if you believe they have a lower true value than your estimate.","60":"Risk Management: Given the risk associated with high-value items, set a strict maximum bid for Machine P, considering the potential deviation between your estimated value and the true value. If the bidding exceeds your maximum bid, be prepared to let it go.","61":"Risk Assessment: Given the limited budget, assess the risk of overestimating the value of the remaining items. For Apparatus H and Implement G, your estimated values are $6600, which is close to your remaining budget. Be cautious, as a slight overbid could lead to a negative profit.","62":"Conserving Resources: If you feel that winning a particular item would deplete your budget or lead to a negative profit, don't hesitate to let it go. Focus on the long-term goal of maintaining profitability throughout the auction.","63":"Bid with a Buffer: Given that you've won Widget A and Appliance O at higher bids than their estimated values, it's crucial to add a smaller buffer to your maximum bid for the remaining items. This will help prevent overpaying and ensure better profit margins.","64":"Be Cautious with Moderate-Value Items: For Gadget B and Implement G, which have moderate estimated values, bid conservatively. Given your past experience, set a stricter maximum bid to avoid overpaying and potentially losing out on higher-value items.","65":"Machine P Strategy: {'Initial Bid': 'Start with a bid slightly above the starting price, say $5050, to signal interest without overcommitting.', 'Incremental Bids': 'Gradually increase your bid in small increments, such as $50 or $100, to test the waters and see if other bidders are as interested.', 'Safety Margin': 'Set a maximum bid limit based on your estimated value minus a safety margin (e.g., $10500 - $1500 = $9000). Withdraw if the price exceeds this limit.'}","66":"Endgame Approach: As the auction nears its end, be more cautious with your remaining budget. If you win Machine P, you may have to pass on Implement G or bid very conservatively to avoid overspending.","67":"Profit Optimization: Keep an eye on the total profits of other bidders. If you sense that winning Machine P would not significantly increase your profit margin compared to the risk involved, you might consider letting it go to conserve your budget for a potential better opportunity in the future.","68":"Final Push: As the auction nears its end, you may need to be more aggressive with your bidding, especially if you have a significant budget left for the high-value items. However, maintain discipline and don't exceed your budget.","69":"Prioritize High-Value Items: Focus on items with the highest estimated values relative to their starting prices, such as Contraption I, Utensil N, Machine P, and Apparatus H.","70":"Budget Awareness: Focus on the items with the highest estimated value relative to their starting price, as you have less room for error with a remaining budget of $600.","71":"Risk Assessment: Prioritize items with a higher chance of having a true value closer to your estimated value. Gadget B and Implement G seem to be lower-risk items, while Apparatus H and Machine P are higher-risk due to their higher starting prices.","72":"Bid Only on High-Value Items: Concentrate on the remaining items that have the potential to provide the highest profit. Gadget B and Apparatus H are particularly attractive due to their high estimated value compared to their starting prices.","73":"Bid Ceilings: Set personal bid ceilings for each item based on your estimated value, accounting for a margin of error.","74":"Watch for Bidding Trends: Observe if other bidders are consistently overbidding or underbidding. If they tend to overbid, you might be able to win items at lower prices by bidding closer to the starting price.","75":"Appliance O: {'bidCeiling': 8500, 'startBid': 4100, 'estimatedValue': 8800}","76":"Gizmo F: {'bidCeiling': 4200, 'startBid': 2100, 'estimatedValue': 4400}","77":"Bid Strategy: For Doodad D, you have an estimated value of $4400 and a bid ceiling of $4200. Start bidding conservatively at $2100 (half of the estimated value) to test the waters and see if other bidders are interested.","78":"Risk Assessment: Given that Doodad D has the same estimated value as Gizmo F and Equipment E, you should weigh the risk of bidding aggressively for Doodad D against the potential for higher profits from the other items. If the bidding for Doodad D exceeds your bid ceiling, be prepared to let it go.","79":"Risk Assessment: Consider the risk associated with each item. If the bidding for Utensil N or Machine P exceeds your bid ceiling, be prepared to let them go and focus on the next best item within your budget.","80":"Patience: If the bidding for Doodad D exceeds your estimated value, don't feel compelled to continue bidding. Your current total profit is $12,100, and you still have several opportunities to increase it with the remaining items.","81":"Bid Strategy: For Gadget B, you can start bidding conservatively, around $1100, and gradually increase as needed. For Implement G, you can start at $1800, as it's closer to your budget limit. For Apparatus H, you might need to be more aggressive, starting at $2700, but be prepared to withdraw if the bidding goes too high. For Machine P, you should likely avoid bidding due to the high starting price and risk of overspending.","82":"Bid Buffer: Given the previous auction results, it's clear that some items have been won at prices close to their true values. To account for potential overestimation, set a bidding limit for each item that is slightly below your estimated value (e.g., 90-95% of the estimated value).","83":"Item Prioritization: Prioritize Apparatus H and Machine P, as they have the highest estimated values and could provide the most significant profit margins. Implement G is a secondary priority, but still worth considering if the bidding for the first two items becomes too competitive.","84":"Learning from Past Bids: Notice that you've been successful in winning items by bidding slightly above the competition. This pattern suggests that you might be able to secure items by bidding just enough to outbid others without overpaying.","85":"Patience: With a limited budget, it's crucial to be patient and let other bidders exhaust their budgets first. This might give you an opportunity to win items at a lower price.","86":"Equipment E: {'bidCeiling': 4200, 'startBid': 2100, 'estimatedValue': 4400}","87":"Utensil N: {'bidCeiling': 8500, 'startBid': 4100, 'estimatedValue': 8800}","88":"Machine P: {'bidCeiling': 10500, 'startBid': 5100, 'estimatedValue': 11000}","89":"Implement G: {'bidCeiling': 6300, 'startBid': 3100, 'estimatedValue': 6600}","90":"Bid Strategy Adaptation: Since you've won several items already, adjust your strategy to be more selective. Focus on the items with the highest potential for profit, even if it means losing some items to other bidders. Avoid bidding wars, especially if they push the price beyond your estimated value.","91":"Observation and Adaptation: Continuously monitor the bidding behavior of other participants. If they seem more aggressive or conservative, adjust your strategy accordingly.","92":"Doodad D: You can afford to bid up to $3800 while still having a buffer for the rest of the auction.","93":"Contraption I: Given the higher estimated value, you can afford to bid more aggressively, but still maintain a buffer.","94":"Equipment E: If you don't win Contraption I, you can bid up to $3300 for Equipment E.","95":"Utensil N: Given the high estimated value, you can bid up to $1600 if you have the budget after previous items, but it's a riskier bid due to the higher starting price.","96":"Gadget B: If you don't win Utensil N, you can bid up to $1300 for Gadget B.","97":"Machine P: You won't have enough budget to bid on Machine P, so it's not a viable option.","98":"Implement G: If you don't win Apparatus H, you can only bid up to $300 for Implement G, which is a very low bid.","99":"Adjusted Values: Apply the buffer to your remaining items: Gizmo F: $4400 - 20% buffer = $3520, Doodad D: $4400 - 20% buffer = $3520, Contraption I: $6600 - 20% buffer = $5280, Equipment E: $4400 - 20% buffer = $3520, Utensil N: $8800 - 20% buffer = $7040, Gadget B: $2200 - 20% buffer = $1760, Apparatus H: $6600 - 20% buffer = $5280, Machine P: $11000 - 20% buffer = $8800, Implement G: $6600 - 20% buffer = $5280","100":"Bid Strategy: Use the adjusted values as your new maximum bid limits. Bid conservatively, not exceeding these limits, to ensure you maintain a healthy profit margin.","101":"Set bid limits: For each remaining item, set a maximum bid limit based on your estimated value minus a buffer (e.g., 10-20%). This will help you avoid overpaying and ensure a potential profit.","102":"Budget Allocation: You have $8700 left, which should be allocated wisely. Focus on the items with the highest estimated value relative to their starting price and your remaining budget.","103":"Bid Withdrawal: If the bidding exceeds your maximum bid limit or if you sense that the true value is likely higher than your estimate, be prepared to withdraw from the bidding.","104":"Learning from Previous Bids: Observe the bidding behavior of Bidder 1, who seems to be more aggressive. If they are bidding on an item you're interested in, you may need to be more assertive to win, but don't exceed your budget.","105":"Risk assessment: Consider the potential deviation between your estimated value and the true value. Be more cautious with items that have a higher risk of overestimation.","106":"Budget Allocation: After winning Widget A, Element R, and Mechanism J, you have a remaining budget of $8700. Allocate this budget wisely, focusing on items with a high potential for profit while ensuring you don't overspend.","107":"Estimate Adjustments: Reflect on the bidding patterns and the true values revealed so far. It seems that your estimates for Widget A and Element R were accurate, but for Mechanism J, you overbid by $1000. Adjust your bidding strategy to account for this, potentially setting a tighter margin between your estimated value and the maximum bid.","108":"Bid Strategically on Mid-Priority Items: Gizmo F, Doodad D, Contraption I, and Equipment E have lower estimated values compared to their high-priority counterparts. Bid conservatively on these items, using them as potential fallback options if you lose out on the high-priority items. Bid just enough to outbid others while staying below your estimated value.","109":"Bid Timing: Observe the bidding behavior of the remaining bidders. If they seem to be more aggressive or conservative, adjust your bidding strategy accordingly. Bid early to establish your interest and late to potentially outbid others at the last moment.","110":"Bid Early on High-Interest Items: If you suspect that an item might attract significant interest, bid early to establish your position and potentially discourage other bidders. However, don't overbid in the early stages.","111":"Estimate True Values of Remaining Items: Consider the possibility that your estimates could be off. Be prepared to adjust your bids if the bidding exceeds your estimated value by a significant margin.","112":"Budget Management: Allocate the remaining budget wisely, prioritizing high-value items while ensuring you have enough for the rest of the auction.","113":"Budget Reallocation: Adjust your bidding strategy to minimize the risk of overpaying for the remaining items, considering the winning bids and true values of previously won items.","114":"Revised Priority List: Revise the priority list based on the estimated value-to-starting price ratio and personal preference, considering the remaining items.","115":"Bid Adjustments: Be more cautious with higher-priced items and focus on lower-priced items with high value-to-price ratios first, given your remaining budget.","116":"High-Priority Items: Mechanism J, Unit Q, Gizmo F, Appliance O, Utensil N, and Machine P are high-priority items due to their high estimated value relative to their starting price. Be more aggressive with these items when the bidding is below your set ceiling.","117":"Bid Gaps: Create bid gaps to discourage other bidders from easily matching your bids. For example, if the current bid is $4000 for Mechanism J, consider bidding $4200 instead of $4100 to make it less attractive for others to continue bidding.","118":"High-Value Targeting: Focus on the items with the highest estimated value relative to their starting price. These are Unit Q, Thingamajig C, Appliance O, Gizmo F, and Utensil N. Allocate a significant portion of your budget to these items, as they offer the best potential for profit.","119":"Risk Management: Since you've already won three items, allocate some budget for riskier items (like Contraption I, Equipment E, and Implement G) with lower estimated values. This can help diversify your portfolio and potentially increase overall profit if you win one or more of these items at a good price.","120":"Monitor Other Bidders: Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other bidders. If they seem to be targeting the same high-value items, you may need to adjust your strategy accordingly, potentially being more aggressive or shifting your focus to other items.","121":"Opportunistic Bidding: If lower-priority items have low bidding activity, you might consider bidding opportunistically if it won't significantly impact your budget for high-priority items.","122":"Track Bidder Absence: Note that Bidders 1, 2, and 3 have not made any bids or have withdrawn from the auction. This could indicate that they have a different strategy, a lower budget, or have already spent their budget on earlier items. Keep an eye out for any future bids from them, as their re-entry might impact your bidding.","123":"Estimate Bidders' Budgets: Since no other bidders have won any items, it's safe to assume they still have their full budgets. However, their absence could also mean they have a higher estimated value for the upcoming items and are waiting for them. Be prepared to face more competition as the auction progresses.","124":"Bidder 4's Position: You currently have the highest profit and have won two items. This might make you appear as a strong bidder, potentially influencing others to be more cautious or aggressive when bidding against you. Be mindful of this perception and adjust your bidding strategy accordingly.","125":"Item Valuation Comparison: For the upcoming items, compare your estimated values with the starting prices. If your estimate is significantly higher, you might want to be more aggressive, but if it's close, bid more conservatively to avoid overpaying.","126":"Balance Risk and Reward: Spread your remaining budget across multiple items to balance risk. Don't put all your money into a single item, as this could result in losing all remaining bids if you overbid.","127":"Save for Endgame: As the auction progresses, consider saving a portion of your budget for the endgame. This can be useful if there's a sudden drop in competition or if you can secure a high-value item at a lower price due to other bidders running out of budget.","128":"Bid Increment Analysis: From the bidding on Widget A, it seems that bidders were willing to increase their bids by $100-$300. Keep this in mind when placing your bids to stay competitive without overbidding.","129":"Bidder Behavior: Bidder 1, 2, and 3 were quick to withdraw after the first or second bid, indicating they might have lower valuations or stricter bidding thresholds. This could mean that you might face less competition from these bidders in the future.","130":"Budget Management: After winning Widget A, you have $18700 left. Given the high starting prices of upcoming items, you need to be more cautious with your bids to ensure you have enough budget for the higher-value items.","131":"High-Value Item Approach: For higher-priced items like Unit Q and Machine P, start with a bid just above the starting price, then gradually increase your bid as the auction progresses. Monitor the bidding behavior of other bidders to gauge their interest and thresholds.","132":"Risk Assessment: Since you've already won Widget A and Element R, be cautious with your next bids. Consider the potential deviation between your estimated value and the true value, especially for items with higher starting prices.","133":"Patience: Avoid getting into bidding wars, especially if the price exceeds your estimated value. Be patient and let other bidders overbid if they feel the item is worth more to them.","134":"Profit Margin Protection: For items with lower estimated values, set a maximum bid limit to ensure you don't risk your profit margin. For instance, for Gizmo F and Doodad D, set a maximum bid that still allows for a reasonable profit.","135":"Risk Assessment: Since you've already made a profit, you can afford to take a bit more risk on items with estimated values close to their starting prices, like Gizmo F, Doodad D, Equipment E, and Gadget B, if you think there's a chance to win them at a good price.","136":"Learning from Mistakes: Reflect on your bidding on Widget A. If you feel you bid too aggressively, adjust your strategy for future items to avoid overbidding.","137":"Estimate True Value Range: Since you don't know the true market value, consider a range for each item's value. This range will help you understand the potential profit or loss for each item you bid on.","138":"Calculate Risk Tolerance: Determine the maximum acceptable deviation between your estimated value and the true value for each item. This will help you decide when to stop bidding if the price goes beyond your risk tolerance.","139":"Prioritize High-Value Items: Focus on items with a higher estimated value relative to their starting price. These have a higher potential for profit, but also higher risk due to their higher starting prices.","140":"Bid Aggressively on High-Confidence Items: If you have a high level of confidence in your estimated value for an item, be more aggressive in bidding, but still within your risk tolerance.","141":"Monitor Budget: Keep track of your remaining budget after each bid, and adjust your bidding strategy accordingly. Avoid overspending early on, as it could limit your opportunities for higher-value items later in the auction.","142":"Learn from Past Bidding: Analyze the bidding behavior of other participants and your own experience. This can help you refine your bidding strategy and better predict when to bid or withdraw.","143":"Consider Market Trends: If you have any information on market trends or demand for these items, factor that into your risk assessment. High demand items may have a higher true value, while low demand items may sell for less than their estimated value.","144":"Item Prioritization: Rank the items based on their potential profitability and bid accordingly. Focus on the items with the highest potential for profit, while being prepared to let go of less valuable ones if the bidding exceeds your estimated value.","145":"Don't Chase Losses: If you lose an item that you valued highly, don't feel compelled to overbid on the next item to recoup your losses. Stick to your strategy and focus on the remaining items with high potential for profit.","146":"Assess Your Position: After each bid, reassess your remaining budget and the potential profitability of the remaining items. Adjust your strategy accordingly, prioritizing the items with the highest potential for profit.","147":"Be Prepared to Wait: If the bidding on a particular item is too high, be patient and wait for the next item. There may be better opportunities later in the auction.","148":"Maintain Emotional Distance: Avoid getting emotionally attached to any particular item. Remember that your goal is to maximize overall profit, not to win every item you value.","149":"Opportunism: Be ready to seize opportunities when other bidders drop out, especially if their exit allows you to win an item at a lower price than expected.","150":"Endgame Strategy: As the auction nears its end and your remaining budget decreases, adjust your bidding strategy to maximize the remaining opportunities. This might involve being more aggressive on the last few items if you have a significant budget left."}},"arms_cnt":{"Bidder 1":[],"Bidder 2":[],"Bidder 3":[],"Bidder 4":[1,8,32,50,56,63,79,87,96,100,106,109,124,130,143,151]},"model_info":{"Bidder 1":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 2":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 3":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 4":"qwen-72b"}}
