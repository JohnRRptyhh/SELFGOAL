The starting price for bidding for Appliance O is $4000. Anyone interested in this item?\"\n\n---\n\nAs Bidder 4, you have to decide whether to bid on this item or withdraw and explain why, according to your plan. Remember, Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some common practices of bidding:\n1. Showing your interest by bidding with or slightly above the starting price of this item, then gradually increase your bid.\n2. Think step by step of the pros and cons and the consequences of your action (e.g., remaining budget in future bidding) in order to achieve your primary objective.\n3. Consider the given sub-goals and detailed advices, you may choose to focus on some of them to help you decide on your action, or ignore them.\n\nGive your reasons first, then make your final decision clearly. You should either withdraw (saying \"I'm out!\") or make a higher bid for this item (saying \"I bid $xxx!\")."},{"ai":"Reasons for my decision:\n\n1. Appliance O is a high-priority item with an estimated value of $8800, which offers a significant profit potential.\n2. The starting price is $4000, which is within the budget and below the estimated value.\n3. However, I need to be cautious not to overbid and push the price too close to the estimated value, as it could reduce the profit margin.\n4. I should also consider the potential competition from other bidders, especially Bidder 3, who might be competitive in this price range.\n\nGiven these factors, I decide to:\n\nI bid $4100! \n\nThis bid shows my interest in the item while still leaving room for potential increases without overextending my budget.

The estimated value of Appliance O is $8800, so bidding $4900 still leaves a decent profit margin.\n4. However, I need to be cautious not to push the price too high, as it could risk reducing my profit or exhausting my budget for other high-priority items.\n\nConsidering these factors, I decide to:\n\nI bid $4900! \n\nThis bid keeps me in the competition while maintaining a reasonable profit margin.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Maintain a reserve for high-value items: Since you've already won Gadget B for $1300, allocate a significant portion of your remaining budget (around $17,700) as a reserve for the high-value items like Appliance O, Utensil N, Unit Q, Machine P, and Mechanism J. These items have estimated values close to or above their starting prices, making them potentially profitable.\n - Bid Aggressively on High-Value Items: For items like Appliance O, Utensil N, and Unit Q, which have high estimated values, consider bidding more aggressively to secure them, as long as the price remains below your bid ceiling.\n - Maintain Profit Margin: Ensure that your bids on each item result in a profit margin that justifies the risk. If the bidding pushes the price too close to your estimated value, it might be safer to withdraw.\n - Bidder 3: This bidder seems to be more competitive but has a clear limit. If you encounter similar items with a starting price around $1000, expect Bidder 3 to be a potential competitor, but they might drop out around the $1200 to $1300 range.\n - Monitor Your Profit Margin: Keep track of your profit margin as the auction progresses and adjust your bidding strategy to focus on higher-profit items to maintain your overall profit goal.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Appliance O:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3: $4500\n- Bidder 4: $4100\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 4: $4900\n\nRound 2:\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
