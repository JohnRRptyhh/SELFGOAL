Be more aggressive on high-value items while being cautious not to overbid.","7":"Estimate true value adjustments: Revise estimated values for remaining items considering similar valuations from other bidders.","8":"Priority List: Rank remaining items based on adjusted estimated values and starting prices: Mechanism J, Element R, Contraption I, Implement G, Gizmo F, Doodad D, Equipment E, Thingamajig C.","9":"Gizmo F: Be prepared to bid conservatively and potentially lose the item if the bidding goes beyond your budget.","10":"Implement G: Monitor the bidding closely and be ready to bid if there's an opportunity.","11":"Opportunistic Bidding: Keep an eye on other bidders' behavior and adjust your strategy accordingly.","12":"Final Item Focus: Focus all your attention on the remaining items and be prepared to end the auction without any more purchases if necessary.","13":"Bid Strategy: {'Thingamajig C': 'Since the starting price is $1000 and your estimated value is $2200, set a maximum bid of $2100 to ensure a profit if you win.', 'Doodad D': 'With a starting price of $2000 and an estimated value of $4400, set a maximum bid of $4300.', 'Gizmo F': 'Similar to Doodad D, set a maximum bid of $4300.', 'Implement G': 'Given the starting price of $3000 and an estimated value of $6600, set a maximum bid of $6500.'}","14":"Avoid Bidding Wars: Recognize that winning a bidding war could lead to a higher winning bid, potentially resulting in a negative profit. Exercise discipline and don't get emotionally invested in winning a particular item.","15":"Profit Optimization: Focus on maximizing your overall profit, not just winning the most items. Winning a single high-value item at a good price can be more profitable than winning multiple low-value items.","16":"Element R: With an estimated value of $11000, set a maximum bid of $10900. This provides a safety margin while still allowing for a profit if you win the item.","17":"Thingamajig C: Given the estimated value of $2200, set a maximum bid of $2100. This is a conservative bid that still allows for a profit while avoiding overpaying.","18":"Doodad D: For an estimated value of $4400, set a maximum bid of $4300. This will help you stay within your budget and maintain a profit margin.","19":"Budget Allocation: With a remaining budget of $400, focus on the items with the highest estimated value relative to their starting price, which are Gizmo F and Implement G.","20":"Gizmo F Strategy: Start with a bid slightly above the starting price, say $2100, to signal interest without overcommitting. Monitor the bidding behavior of other bidders and be prepared to increment your bid in small increments, but be ready to drop out if the price exceeds your estimated value.","21":"Budget Analysis: Observe the spending patterns of other bidders to assess their budget constraints and potential willingness to bid higher.","22":"Item Interest: Evaluate the level of interest in specific items based on the bidding activity and final prices.","23":"Bidder 2 and 3's Opportunities: Identify opportunities for Bidder 2 and Bidder 3 to secure high-value items based on their bidding history and perceived interest in Implement G.","24":"Risk Assessment: Assess the risk of overestimating Implement G's value and weigh it against the potential profit.","25":"Final Item Consideration: If you don't win Gizmo F or Implement G, consider whether there are any remaining items with lower starting prices that might still offer a profit margin, even if it's smaller.","26":"Budget Allocation: Prioritize bidding on Doodad D and Gizmo F over Implement G, as they have a higher estimated value relative to their starting prices. If you win both, you can then decide if bidding on Implement G is feasible.","27":"Bid Increment Strategy: For Implement G, since you've set a maximum bid of $6500, start bidding conservatively, allowing other bidders to reveal their interest and value estimates. Increase your bid incrementally to stay competitive but not exceed your maximum.","28":"Item Selection: For the remaining items, prioritize Thingamajig C and Doodad D, as they have high estimated values and lower starting prices. However, be cautious with Doodad D, as its starting price is double that of Thingamajig C, so it may require a more strategic approach.","29":"Guidelines: {'Budget Management': 'Keep track of your remaining budget ($2000) and adjust your maximum bids accordingly to ensure you have enough funds for higher-value items.', 'Bid Increment Strategy': 'Be mindful of the bid increments to stay competitive without overbidding. You can slightly exceed your maximum bid if necessary, but avoid going too far beyond it.', 'Bidder Behavior': 'Observe the bidding patterns of other bidders to predict their thresholds and adjust your bids accordingly.', 'Risk Assessment': 'If the bidding on an item surpasses your maximum bid, be prepared to withdraw to avoid potential losses.', 'Opportunistic Bidding': 'If other bidders seem to be running low on budget or are less active, consider bidding more aggressively on items with high estimated values.'}","30":"Budget Allocation: You have a remaining budget of $2000. Given the high-value items you've identified (Element R and Implement G), you need to allocate your budget wisely. Since Implement G has a higher estimated value, it should be your primary target, followed by Element R if possible.","31":"Bid Strategy for Element R: If you can't afford Implement G, or if the bidding on it becomes too competitive, focus on Element R. With a starting price of $2000, you can bid up to $2000, which is your entire remaining budget. This will require a more aggressive approach, as you won't have any funds left for other items.","32":"Learn from Past Bids: Analyze your bidding behavior and the outcomes. You've won several items, but in some cases, you might have overbid (e.g., Utensil N and Apparatus H). Be cautious not to repeat this pattern.","33":"Bid Only to Profit: Only bid on an item if you believe you can win it at a price below or close to your estimated value. This will ensure a positive profit margin.","34":"Anticipate Competition: Observe the bidding patterns of other bidders. If Bidder 1 seems to be targeting high-value items, be prepared for competition on Implement G.","35":"Set Thresholds: Determine a maximum bid for each remaining item based on your estimated value and the remaining budget. Stick to these thresholds to maintain discipline.","36":"Wait for Opportunities: If the bidding on an item is too high early on, be patient and wait for other bidders to drop out. This can sometimes lead to a better chance of winning at a lower price.","37":"Avoid Emotional Bidding: Remember that the goal is to maximize profit, not to win every item. Don't let the excitement of the auction cloud your judgment.","38":"Doodad D and Gizmo F: Keep an eye on the bidding for these items, as they have lower starting prices and your estimated values are $4400. If the bidding on Implement G becomes too competitive or exceeds your estimated value, you can pivot to these items if they become more attractive due to lower bids.","39":"Exit Strategy: If you can't secure either Element R or Implement G, evaluate your overall position and decide whether to conserve your remaining budget for future auctions or take a calculated risk on a lower-value item.","40":"Bidder 1's Bidding Strategy: Bidder 1 appears to be more competitive when the starting price is closer to their estimated value. They have bid aggressively on items with starting prices between $4000 and $5000, which aligns with their winning bids.","41":"Bidder 1's Exit Points: Bidder 1 has withdrawn from bidding when their bid was surpassed by a higher bid, suggesting they have a clear limit for each item based on their estimated value.","42":"Bidder 1's Response to Competition: Bidder 1 has shown a tendency to increase their bids when faced with competition, as seen in the bidding wars for Unit Q, Machine P, and Mechanism J.","43":"Bid increments: Use smaller bid increments early to avoid driving up the price too quickly. Increase increments as the bidding war progresses and you get closer to your maximum bid.","44":"Profit Analysis: Assess your current profit from the won items. Subtract the winning bids from the true values to understand your net profit so far.","45":"Implement G: The starting price is $3000, which is a higher risk due to your limited budget. If you win Gizmo F, you'll have $1000 left for Implement G. If you believe Implement G is more valuable, you might need to be more aggressive in bidding for Gizmo F to ensure you have a chance at Implement G. Start with a bid around $3100, but be prepared to drop out if the price rises too quickly.","46":"Exit Strategy: If the bidding for either Gizmo F or Implement G exceeds your estimated value, be prepared to withdraw to avoid potential losses. Your primary goal is to maximize profit, not to win at all costs.","47":"Budget Allocation: Allocate a significant portion of your remaining budget ($2000) for Implement G, but ensure you have enough for potential opportunities in the future.","48":"Estimate Reassessment: If the bidding goes higher than expected, reassess the item's true value based on the auction's progress and the behavior of other bidders. If the price exceeds your revised estimate, be prepared to drop out to avoid potential losses.","49":"Exit Plan: Have a pre-determined point at which you will stop bidding, based on your budget and the perceived risk of overpaying. This will help you maintain discipline and avoid getting caught up in a bidding war.","50":"Patience and Discipline: Maintain discipline and patience, especially if Bidder 1 is actively bidding. Don't get caught up in bidding wars that could deplete your budget.","51":"Risk Assessment: Be cautious with items that have a starting price close to or higher than their estimated value, as the true value might be lower, leading to potential losses. For instance, with Utensil N, you overpaid by $600, so be more careful with similar situations.","52":"Competitor Analysis: Observe the bidding patterns of other bidders, especially Bidder 3, who has shown a willingness to bid aggressively on high-value items. Adjust your strategy accordingly, either by bidding more aggressively or holding back if they seem to be targeting the same items.","53":"Monitor the bidding patterns: Keep track of how Bidder 1, Bidder 2, and Bidder 3 have been bidding, especially on items with similar values to Gizmo F. If they show signs of fatigue or have shifted their focus to higher-value items, it could indicate a lower competition for Gizmo F.","54":"Estimate the true value of Gizmo F: Based on the bidding trends and the hammer prices of previous items, try to refine your estimate of Gizmo F's true value. If it seems that the true value is closer to your estimate, it's a good indication to bid more aggressively.","55":"Be more conservative with initial bids: Start with lower bids to gauge the competition's interest and avoid getting caught up in a bidding war early on. For Implement G, consider bidding slightly above the starting price but not too close to your estimated value.","56":"Exit strategy: Have a clear point at which you will stop bidding, even if it means losing the item. For Implement G, if the price exceeds $6500, it might be wise to consider your exit strategy, as it's approaching your estimated value.","57":"Bid conservatively on Widget A and Thingamajig C: Since their estimated values are the same as Gadget B, which you overbid on, be more cautious and bid closer to the starting price to avoid overpaying.","58":"Conserving Funds: With only $800 left, focus on bidding conservatively to ensure you have a chance at the higher-value items. If the bidding on Doodad D and Gizmo F becomes too high, consider saving your budget for Implement G, which has a higher estimated value.","59":"Anticipate Competition: Bidder 1 has shown a willingness to bid high on items with a starting price of $5000 or more. Be prepared for potential bidding wars with them on Element R and consider whether it's worth the risk.","60":"Opportunistic Bidding: Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other bidders. If they appear to be running low on budget or have already won high-value items, you might have a better chance of securing Mechanism J or Element R at a more favorable price.","61":"Item Prioritization: If you cannot afford both Mechanism J and Element R, prioritize the one with the higher estimated value (Element R in this case) and focus on that first. If you win Element R, adjust your bidding strategy for Mechanism J accordingly.","62":"Budget Allocation: You have a remaining budget of $2000. Given the high-value items you've lost, it's crucial to allocate this budget wisely to maximize profit.","63":"High-Value Opportunities: Keep an eye on Element R, as it has a high estimated value of $11000. If the bidding stays within your budget, consider participating, but be cautious not to overbid.","64":"Low-Value Item Approach: For low-value items (Thingamajig C, Doodad D, and Gizmo F), consider bidding only if the bidding is low and you have extra budget left after securing the high- and mid-value items. These items have lower profit potential, so focus on them only if they won't compromise your chances at higher profits.","65":"Bid Sensitivity: Be aware of the bidding behavior of other bidders. If they seem to be more aggressive, be prepared to adjust your bid increments accordingly, but don't exceed your bid ceiling.","66":"Anticipate True Value: As the auction progresses, you might get a better sense of the true value of items based on the bidding patterns. Use this information to refine your bidding strategy.","67":"Risk assessment: Weigh the potential profit against the risk of overestimating the item's true value. If the risk is high, consider dropping out of the bidding early.","68":"Budget for High-Value Items: Since Implement G has a higher estimated value ($6600), prioritize allocating a larger portion of your remaining budget to this item. However, be cautious not to overbid and exhaust your funds.","69":"Risk Management: Given your remaining budget of $2000, you can afford to bid aggressively on one high-value item (Implement G) and more conservatively on the other (Gizmo F). If you win Implement G, you might not have enough for Gizmo F, so prioritize accordingly.","70":"Exit Points: Determine the maximum bid you're willing to make for each item based on your revised estimated values. Be prepared to withdraw if the price exceeds these thresholds.","71":"Profit Margin: Aim for a higher profit margin by bidding just enough to outbid competitors without overpaying. This will maximize your overall profit potential.","72":"Final Bid Allocation: If possible, try to allocate your remaining budget in a way that allows you to bid competitively on both items, but be prepared to focus on the higher-value item (Implement G) if necessary.","73":"Be Patient: Don't feel compelled to bid on every item. If the bidding exceeds your estimated value or if you sense a high risk of overpaying, let the item go.","74":"Risk Management: Given your lower budget compared to Bidder 1, focus on items with lower starting prices but high estimated values. This will minimize the risk of losing a significant portion of your budget on a single item.","75":"Stay Objective: Keep a cool head and don't let the excitement of winning or the fear of losing an item cloud your judgment. Stick to your pre-determined strategy and value estimates.","76":"Endgame Strategy: As the auction nears its end, be more assertive in bidding on the remaining high-value items, but still within your budget and bid ceilings.","77":"Profit Margin Calculation: As the auction progresses, calculate your potential profit margins for each item based on the current bid and your estimated value. This will help you make informed decisions about when to continue bidding or withdraw.","78":"Secondary Targets: If you are outbid on your top priorities, shift your focus to the next highest valued items (e.g., Apparatus H, Contraption I, and Equipment E) that still fall within your budget and estimated value range.","79":"Be selective with Equipment E, Gizmo F, and Doodad D: These items have estimated values similar to the ones you've already won. Bid conservatively, only if you believe they have a higher true value than your estimate or if the competition is weak.","80":"Profit Margin Protection: Maintain a minimum profit margin of $500-$1000 on each item to ensure a reasonable return on investment, even if it means losing some bids.","81":"Item Prioritization: Prioritize high-value items (Mechanism J, Element R, and Implement G) and bid more conservatively on lower-value items (Contraption I, Equipment E, Thingamajig C, Doodad D, and Gizmo F).","82":"Bid Early, Bid Smart: Consider bidding slightly above the starting price for high-value items to establish interest and potentially discourage other bidders with lower budgets or lower estimated values.","83":"Risk Management: Be prepared to walk away if the bidding exceeds your estimated value, even for high-value items. This will help you preserve your budget for future opportunities.","84":"Bid Aggressively on High-Value Items: For Element R and Implement G, be prepared to bid more aggressively, up to your estimated value, as these have the potential for high profits.","85":"Bid Psychology: Observe the bidding patterns of Bidder 1, who seems to have a higher budget and has won high-value items. If Bidder 1 shows signs of reaching their budget limit, bid more aggressively to potentially outbid them.","86":"Revised Value Estimates: {'Gadget B and Widget A': 'Adjust future bids for similar items to be more conservative.', 'Apparatus H': 'Be more aggressive on items with similar estimated values, as they might have a higher true value than initially thought.'}","87":"Budget Allocation: Focus on the items with the highest estimated value that you can afford, such as Mechanism J and Element R.","88":"Final Bid: For the last item, consider whether it's worth using your remaining budget to secure a profit, even if it's not a high-value item. This could be a strategic move to ensure you don't leave the auction with unused funds.","89":"Maintain a Profitable Bid-to-Value Ratio: Aim to win items with a bid that is significantly lower than your estimated value. For example, if your estimated value is $6600, try not to bid more than $5000 to ensure a healthy profit margin.","90":"Opportunistic Bidding: Consider opportunistically bidding on lower-value items with low competition to increase overall profit, but only if it won't compromise your ability to bid on high-value items.","91":"Reevaluate Estimated Values: Increase your estimated values for Utensil N and Mechanism J by a conservative margin, say 10-20%, to account for the possibility of underestimating their true values.","92":"Budget Preservation: Ensure you have enough budget to bid competitively on the high-value items. Be prepared to let go of lower-value items to conserve your budget if necessary.","93":"Bid on Less Competitive Items: If you sense that there will be strong competition for Utensil N, consider bidding more aggressively on Mechanism J or vice versa. Focus on the item with fewer potential bidders to increase your chances of winning.","94":"Bid Ceilings for Apparatus H and Contraption I: Set a maximum bid of $6500 for both Apparatus H and Contraption I, leaving a buffer of $1500 in case the true value is higher or bidding competition is stronger.","95":"Re-evaluate Contraption I: Although no one bid on Contraption I in the previous round, it's worth considering if the starting price drops or if you have extra budget after bidding on Mechanism J and Element R. Keep an eye on its potential value and adjust your strategy accordingly.","96":"Bid on Implement G: If you still have budget left, Implement G with an estimated value of $6600 could be a good choice. However, be cautious as the starting price is $3000, which might push the final price higher.","97":"Avoid overbidding: Remember to maintain a buffer in your budget to avoid getting caught up in bidding wars. It's better to let an item go than to overspend and risk running out of funds for higher-value items.","98":"Bid Ceilings: {'Machine P': 'Set a maximum bid of $10500, as per the initial goal. This leaves a buffer of $500 in case the true value is higher or competition is intense.', 'Mechanism J': \"Set a maximum bid of $8800, which is its estimated value. This is a more conservative approach, as it's the exact value you expect, but you can adjust this based on the auction dynamics.\"}","99":"Bid Ceiling for Mechanism J: Set a maximum bid of $8700, allowing for flexibility while preserving funds for the remaining items.","100":"Bid Ceiling for Equipment E, Gizmo F, and Doodad D: Set a maximum bid of $4300 for each, leaving room for potential overestimation or competition.","101":"Bid Ceiling for High-Value Items: For high-value items like Machine P, Contraption I, Mechanism J, Element R, and Element R, set a bid ceiling that is slightly below your estimated value to avoid overpaying. For example, for Machine P, a bid ceiling of $10,500 could be appropriate.","102":"Bid Aggressively on Contraption I and Mechanism J: Since these items have high estimated values relative to their starting prices, bid aggressively to secure them, but don't exceed the bid ceiling.","103":"Bid Ceilings for Low-Value Items: For Thingamajig C, Doodad D, and Implement G, set bid ceilings based on their estimated values. For Thingamajig C, you've already set a ceiling of $2100. For Doodad D and Implement G, consider ceilings of $4300 and $6500, respectively.","104":"Budget Allocation: Focus on the items with the highest estimated value relative to their starting price, considering the remaining budget of $4,700.","105":"Low-Value Item Strategy: Consider bidding on low-value items only if the bidding stays within your estimated value, you have extra budget after securing high-value items, or you believe the true value might be higher based on auction dynamics.","106":"Risk Assessment: For items with lower estimated values, like Gizmo F, Doodad D, and Thingamajig C, weigh the potential profit against the risk of overbidding. If the risk is high, consider letting these items go to other bidders.","107":"Learning from Past Bids: Reflect on the bidding process for Gadget B, where you overbid by $800. Use this as a lesson to be more disciplined in future rounds, especially when the true value is lower than your estimate.","108":"Price-to-Value Ratio: Analyze the winning bids in relation to the true values. For instance, Gadget B and Widget A were won at a price that was significantly lower than their true values, while Apparatus H was won at a higher price. This suggests that the market might be more competitive for higher-value items.","109":"Bidder 1's Budget: Consider Bidder 1's remaining budget and their potential to outbid you on high-value items. If they have a significant budget left, they might be a strong competitor for Machine P, Element R, or other high-value items.","110":"Patience in Bidding Wars: If a bidding war starts, be patient and let the other bidders drive the price up first. Only enter the bidding when it's closer to your estimated value, and be prepared to walk away if the price surpasses your threshold.","111":"Flexibility: Be prepared to adjust your strategy if new information arises, such as other bidders dropping out or showing a different level of interest in high-value items.","112":"Opportunistic Bidding: If you win either Utensil N or Mechanism J, use the remaining budget to bid on other items with lower estimated values but still have a potential for profit, like Gizmo F, Doodad D, or Implement G.","113":"Opportunistic Bidding: Keep an eye on items with lower starting prices, like Widget A and Thingamajig C, which could provide good profit margins if the bidding stays low. Bid conservatively on these items, but be prepared to drop out if the price rises too quickly.","114":"Bid Ceilings: Set personal bid ceilings for each item based on your revised estimates. This will help you avoid overbidding and ensure you have enough budget for later items.","115":"Bidder Behavior Observation: Monitor the bidding patterns of other bidders to identify their thresholds and adjust your strategy accordingly. If a bidder consistently drops out early, they might have a lower budget or different priorities.","116":"Exit Strategy: If you win an early high-value item, adjust your budget allocation for the remaining items. If you don't win, be prepared to shift your focus to the next high-value item.","117":"Contingency Plan: If you exhaust your budget before reaching the high-value items, reassess your bidding strategy and consider targeting lower-value items with higher profit margins to recoup some funds.","118":"Patience: Be patient and wait for the right moments to bid. Don't get caught up in the excitement of the auction and bid impulsively. Stick to your strategy and let other bidders reveal their valuations first.","119":"Price-to-Value Ratio: Observe the price-to-value ratios of the items you've won. Adjust your future bids accordingly, being more cautious with items that have similar estimated values.","120":"Budget Impact: Consider the impact of your winning bids on your remaining budget. Be more selective with your bids, focusing on high-value items where you have a better chance of winning at a reasonable price.","121":"Risk Tolerance: Reassess your risk tolerance based on your current profit and loss situation. Be careful not to overextend yourself, especially for items with higher estimated values.","122":"Market Trends: Gather more information about the broader market to refine your item value estimates. This could involve researching similar items sold in other auctions or online marketplaces.","123":"Learning from Past Bids: Analyze the bidding patterns of other bidders. If they tend to bid aggressively, you may need to set your bid limits slightly higher to account for this behavior.","124":"Risk Management: Since you've already won four items, be mindful of the risk of overestimating values. Analyze the bidding patterns of other bidders to better understand their valuation strategies and adjust your own accordingly.","125":"Item Selection: Focus on the items with the highest potential profit margins first (Unit Q, Machine P, Mechanism J, and Element R). If you win one or more of these, you can then consider bidding on the remaining items with lower profit margins.","126":"Exit Plan: If your budget is significantly depleted after bidding on high-value items, consider adopting a more conservative approach for the rest of the auction, focusing on items with lower starting prices and estimated values that align with your remaining budget.","127":"Alternative Items: Identify backup items with similar estimated values, such as Equipment E, Element R, Gizmo F, and Implement G, in case you are outbid on your top choices. These items can still provide good profit potential if you manage to win them at a reasonable price.","128":"Bid Timing: Observe the bidding behavior of other bidders and time your bids to be competitive but not overly aggressive. Wait for other bidders to drop out before increasing your bid, if possible.","129":"Risk Assessment: Re-evaluate your estimated values for the remaining items based on the bidding patterns and the hammer prices of previous items. If necessary, adjust your bid ceilings accordingly.","130":"Monitor True Value: If possible, try to gauge the true value of items based on the bidding behavior and the hammer prices of previous items. This can help you refine your bid limits.","131":"Prioritize items with higher profit margins: Focus on items with a higher difference between your estimated value and their starting price. For example, Widget A, Gizmo F, and Implement G have lower starting prices but still offer decent profit potential.","132":"Don't overcommit on low-value items: While it's tempting to bid on low-value items like Widget A or Gizmo F, be cautious not to overbid and exhaust your budget. If the price exceeds your estimated value, it's better to let them go.","133":"Item Valuation Reassessment: Given that you won Appliance O with a bid of $4900, which is close to your estimated value, it's possible that other bidders had similar estimates. This suggests that there might be more competition for high-value items.","134":"Adapt to the auction dynamics: As the auction progresses, adjust your bidding strategy based on the items that have been won and the remaining budget of other bidders. If a high-value item is won by a bidder with a low remaining budget, you might be able to bid more aggressively on subsequent high-value items.","135":"Estimate true value range: Since you have a $20000 budget and Bidder 3 has already spent $800, consider that their remaining budget could influence their bidding on high-value items. This might affect your bidding strategy on items with overlapping estimated values, like Appliance O, Utensil N, and Mechanism J.","136":"Bid increment strategy: For items with a high estimated value, like Appliance O, Utensil N, and Mechanism J, start with conservative bid increments to test the waters without overcommitting early. For example, bid $4100, $4100, and $4100 respectively, just above the starting price, to gauge the competition.","137":"Monitor other bidders' behavior: Observe how other bidders react to price increases and their willingness to continue bidding. This can help you refine your estimated value range and adjust your bids accordingly.","138":"Budget allocation: Since you have a large budget, you can afford to be more competitive on high-value items. However, ensure that you don't exhaust your budget too early, leaving you unable to bid on later items with high profit potential.","139":"Bid Aggressively on Mid-Value Items with Low Competition: For mid-value items like Apparatus H, Contraption I, and Equipment E, if the competition seems low, you can bid more aggressively to secure these items, as they can still contribute to your overall profit without risking too much.","140":"Bidder Behavior Analysis: {'Bidder 1 and 2': 'Seem to be less aggressive or have lower budgets, as they withdrew quickly.', 'Bidder 3': 'Has a more conservative approach, winning Gadget B with a profit of $800.'}","141":"Fine-Grained Goals: {'Bid More Conservatively': 'Given the lower hammer prices for Gadget B and Utensil N, consider bidding slightly below your estimated values to account for potential market undervaluation.', 'Prioritize High-Value Items': \"Since you've already won Appliance O and Utensil N, focus on the remaining high-value items (Apparatus H, Unit Q, Machine P, Contraption I, and Mechanism J) to maximize your profit potential.\", 'Bid Aggressively on Undervalued Items': 'If you observe items selling for less than their true value, be prepared to bid more aggressively to secure a higher profit margin.', 'Monitor Bidder 3': \"Since Bidder 3 has shown a conservative approach, they might be a good indicator of the market's lower valuation. Keep an eye on their bids to gauge the competition.\", 'Budget Management': 'After winning two items, you have $9700 left. Allocate your budget wisely, considering the potential true values and bidding competition for the remaining items.'}","142":"Be prepared to walk away: If the bidding on any item surpasses your estimated value, be prepared to withdraw and focus on the next item. Remember, the goal is to maximize overall profit, not to win every item.","143":"Bid Increment Calculation: Determine the appropriate bid increments to stay competitive without overpaying. This will depend on the current bid, the perceived value of the item, and the remaining budget.","144":"Bidder 1: Keep an eye on their behavior to understand if they are more likely to bid on higher-value items or if they have a specific item preference.","145":"Bidder 4 (You): Be prepared to adjust your bid strategy if you notice a pattern in Bidder 3's bidding behavior.","146":"Track Bid Increments: Note the bid increments of each bidder to understand their bidding patterns. If they tend to increase their bids in small increments, they might be more risk-averse. If they jump significantly, they might be more aggressive.","147":"Estimate Budgets: Try to estimate the remaining budgets of other bidders based on the winning bids and the remaining items. This can help you predict when they might drop out of bidding.","148":"Item Preferences: Observe if any bidders show a preference for specific types of items or price ranges. This can help you anticipate their behavior in upcoming rounds.","149":"Bidder Thresholds: Use this information to your advantage when bidding on items they might also be interested in.","150":"Bidder Confidence: If a bidder wins an item early on, they might feel more confident and willing to bid aggressively on subsequent items. Conversely, if they lose an item they were interested in, they might become more cautious.","151":"Timing: Be aware of the timing of bids. If a bidder consistently waits until the last moment to bid, they might be trying to outbid others without revealing their maximum bid.","152":"Maintain Bid Increment Strategy: Stick to a bidding increment strategy that reflects your estimated value and the current bid, without overbidding.","153":"Prioritize High-Value Items: Prioritize high-value items such as Appliance O, Utensil N, Apparatus H, Unit Q, Machine P, Mechanism J, and Element R, as they have the potential for higher profits.","154":"Monitor Budget: Keep track of your remaining budget after each bid, ensuring you have enough funds for the high-value items that are yet to come.","155":"Wait for Others to Overbid: Let other bidders exhaust their budgets on items with lower profit potential while you conserve yours for the more valuable items.","156":"Anticipate Competition: Anticipate competition for multiple high-value items with similar estimated values and be ready to adapt your strategy accordingly.","157":"Opportunism: Be ready to seize opportunities when other bidders drop out or show signs of fatigue, especially on high-value items.","158":"Item Prioritization: Rank the items based on their estimated value and prioritize bidding on the most valuable ones, especially if they have a lower starting price.","159":"Exit Strategy: Have a plan for when to stop bidding on an item if it becomes clear that the true value is lower than your estimate or if the competition is too fierce."}},"arms_cnt":{"Bidder 1":[],"Bidder 2":[],"Bidder 3":[],"Bidder 4":[1,10,37,47,60,73,81,88,99,106,117,122,133,142,154,160]},"model_info":{"Bidder 1":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 2":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 3":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 4":"qwen-72b"}}
