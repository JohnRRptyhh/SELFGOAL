Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Bid Strategy Development: Develop a bidding strategy that allows you to bid conservatively, ensuring that you don't overpay for items. This could involve setting a maximum bid limit for each item based on your estimated value, with a buffer to account for potential overestimation.\n - Budget Management: Allocate your budget wisely, considering the potential value of each item and the likelihood of competition. Prioritize items with higher estimated values and lower starting prices to maximize your profit margin.\n - Competitive Analysis: Observe the bidding behavior of other participants to gauge their interest and estimated values for the items. This can help you determine when to bid more aggressively or hold back.\n - Risk Assessment: Assess the risk of overpaying for an item based on the deviation between your estimated value and the true value. Be prepared to let go of an item if the price exceeds your comfort level.\n - Timing: Time your bids strategically to avoid driving up the price unnecessarily. Wait until the last moment to bid if possible, to minimize the chances of a bidding war.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"As Bidder 4, you have a total budget of $20000.

Remember, Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some common practices of bidding:\n1. Showing your interest by bidding with or slightly above the starting price of this item, then gradually increase your bid.\n2. Think step by step of the pros and cons and the consequences of your action (e.g., remaining budget in future bidding) in order to achieve your primary objective.\n3. Consider the given sub-goals and detailed advices, you may choose to focus on some of them to help you decide on your action, or ignore them.\n\nGive your reasons first, then make your final decision clearly. You should either withdraw (saying \"I'm out!\") or make a higher bid for this item (saying \"I bid $xxx!\")."},{"ai":"Reasons for my decision:\n- Utensil N is a high-priority item with an estimated value of $8800, and the starting price is $4000.\n- According to my plan, I should bid aggressively up to $8000, but I need to be cautious of Bidder 2's potential competition.\n- Bidding slightly above the starting price is a common practice to show interest and potentially discourage other bidders with lower estimated values.\n\nFinal Decision: \"I bid $4100!\" This bid is slightly above the starting price, showing my interest in the item while leaving room for gradual increases up to my maximum bid limit of $8000, considering the competition and my primary objective of securing the highest profit."},{"human":"Now, the auctioneer says: \"Thank you!

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Set conservative maximum bid limits: For Utensil N, set a maximum bid limit of $8600 (your estimated value minus a $200 buffer). For Equipment E, set a limit of $4200, Implement G at $6400, Unit Q at $10,800, Machine P at $10,800, Mechanism J at $8600, Gadget B at $2000, Widget A at $2000, Contraption I at $6400, Thingamajig C at $2000, Apparatus H at $6400, Element R at $10,800, Gizmo F at $4200, and Appliance O at $8600.\n - Bid competitively but not aggressively: Observe Bidder 2's behavior and try to outbid them only when it makes financial sense, considering your maximum bid limits.\n - Bid Aggressively on High-Value Items: For Utensil N, Implement G, and Gizmo F, consider bidding more aggressively since they have high estimated values and relatively low starting prices. However, be mindful of Bidder 2's potential competition.\n - Bidder 4's Position: You have not won any items yet and have a full budget remaining. This puts you in a strong position to bid aggressively on high-value items, but be cautious not to overbid based on your estimated values.\n - Monitor True Value: As the auction progresses, try to infer the true value of items based on the bidding patterns. If the bidding exceeds your perceived true value, consider dropping out to avoid overpaying.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Utensil N:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3: $4500\n- Bidder 4: $4100\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 4: $4900\n\nRound 2:\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

This suggests a need for stricter adherence to your maximum bid limits.\n - Reevaluate maximum bid limits: Given your current profit of $3100 and remaining budget of $15100, you can afford to be slightly more aggressive on high-value items while still maintaining a buffer. You might want to adjust your maximum bid limits slightly upward for the high-value items (e.g., Unit Q, Machine P, Element R) while keeping them conservative for the lower-value items.\n - Wait for the Right Moment: Don't bid immediately; wait until the last possible moment to bid, especially if Bidder 2 is active. This can prevent a bidding war and potentially save you money.\n - Set Bid Limits: For each remaining item, set a maximum bid limit based on your estimated value minus a buffer (e.g., 10-20%).

For Mechanism J, set a limit of $8,500, and so on.\n - Set stricter bid limits: For the remaining items, set a stricter maximum bid limit, which is lower than your estimated value by a larger margin. This will help prevent overpaying and ensure a higher potential for profit.\n - Element R: Similar to Machine P, you can bid up to $9900, considering a $1000 buffer. Monitor Bidder 3's behavior, as they might be interested in this high-value item as well.\n - Gizmo F: Bid up to $3300, which is $1100 below your estimated value.

For example, for Unit Q and Machine P, set a limit of $10,000 (your estimated value minus $1,000). For Mechanism J, set a limit of $8,500, and so on.\n - Set stricter bid limits: For the remaining items, set a stricter maximum bid limit, which is lower than your estimated value by a larger margin. This will help prevent overpaying and ensure a higher potential for profit.\n - Element R: Similar to Machine P, you can bid up to $9900, considering a $1000 buffer. Monitor Bidder 3's behavior, as they might be interested in this high-value item as well.\n - Gizmo F: Bid up to $3300, which is $1100 below your estimated value.

This can be achieved by setting a stricter bidding threshold, such as bidding no more than 90% of the estimated value.\n - Budget Allocation: Allocate your remaining budget to the most promising items.

Focus on items with the highest potential for profit while ensuring enough budget for more valuable items.\n - Wait for the Right Moment: Don't be the first to bid. Let other bidders reveal their interest and estimated values first, then bid strategically to avoid driving up the price.\n - Estimate Competition: Observe the bidding patterns of Bidder 2, as they have shown a willingness to bid aggressively on items with high estimated values. If they continue this pattern, they might be a strong competitor for Appliance O.\n - Gizmo F: As per your goal, bid up to $3900, with a $1000 buffer.

However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Target High-Value Items: Focus on the remaining items with high estimated values, such as Element R and Appliance O, as they offer the best potential for significant profit. Gizmo F, while valuable, may not provide the same profit margin as the other two.\n - Assess Past Performance: Observe that Bidder 3 has been more aggressive and successful, while Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 have won fewer items. This suggests that Bidder 3 might continue to be a strong competitor.\n - Budget Allocation: Reallocate your remaining budget based on the priority of the remaining items. Since Appliance O is your top priority, ensure you have enough funds reserved for it, even if it means being more cautious with the other items.\n - Reassess Estimated Values: Reevaluate your estimates for the remaining items, taking into account the actual selling prices of similar items.\n - Bidder 2's Profit Margins: Bidder 2 has made a profit of $5000, indicating they are bidding conservatively and not overpaying. This is a good sign that they are experienced and may continue to bid smartly.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $11300\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $1700\n  * Bidder 2: $5000\n  * Bidder 3: $8400\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Gadget B: $1200\n    * Thingamajig C: $1100\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Doodad D: $2500\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * Unit Q: $6000\n    * Machine P: $6500\n    * Widget A: $1100\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Showing your interest by bidding with or slightly above the starting price of this item, then gradually increase your bid.\n2. Think step by step of the pros and cons and the consequences of your action (e.g., remaining budget in future bidding) in order to achieve your primary objective.\n3. Consider the given sub-goals and detailed advices, you may choose to focus on some of them to help you decide on your action, or ignore them.\n\nGive your reasons first, then make your final decision clearly. You should either withdraw (saying \"I'm out!\") or make a higher bid for this item (saying \"I bid $xxx!\")."},{"ai":"Reasons for my decision:\n1. According to my plan, Gizmo F has a priority of 2, which means it's a good value item but not a top priority.\n2. The starting price is $2000, and my estimated value for Gizmo F is $4400. I can bid slightly above the starting price to show interest without overcommitting.\n3. I need to conserve my budget for the higher priority item, Appliance O, which has a starting price of $4000 and a higher estimated value.\n4. I should be cautious of Bidder 3, who has shown a willingness to bid aggressively in the past.\n\nFinal decision: I bid $2100!

If the bidding on Gizmo F escalates, I will be prepared to withdraw to focus on my top priority."},{"human":"Now, the auctioneer says: \"Thank you!

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Estimate Adjustments: Since Bidder 2 has shown a willingness to bid aggressively on items with similar estimated values as Bidder 4 (Doodad D and Mechanism J), it's wise to revise the estimated values for the remaining items they might be interested in (Gizmo F and Appliance O). Bidder 4 should consider adding a premium to account for potential competition from Bidder 2, especially if the starting prices are low.\n - Win Appliance O, as it has a high estimated value.: Start bidding just above the starting price to show interest without overcommitting. Set a maximum bid limit based on your estimated value, with a buffer for potential overestimation. Monitor the bidding behavior of other bidders, especially Bidder 3, who has a history of high bids. Be prepared to bid incrementally if necessary, but don't exceed your maximum limit. If the bidding becomes too high, consider the potential profit and adjust your strategy accordingly.\n - Budget Allocation: Reallocate your remaining budget based on the priority of the remaining items. Since Appliance O is your top priority, ensure you have enough funds reserved for it, even if it means being more cautious with the other items.\n - Bid Increment Strategy: Start with a conservative bid, slightly above the starting price, to gauge the interest of other bidders. This will also help avoid driving up the price too quickly.\n - Set More Realistic Bid Limits: Consider bidding up to 90% or even 80% of your estimated value to account for potential overestimation.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Gizmo F:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $2200\n- Bidder 2: $2500\n- Bidder 3: $2500\n- Bidder 4: $2100\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Gizmo F, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Gizmo F. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.
