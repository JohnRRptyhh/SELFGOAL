This suggests that Widget A, Gizmo F, and Thingamajig C might be less attractive to Bidder 3, while Contraption I and Apparatus H could still be of interest.","1":"Bid Strategy for Gizmo F and Thingamajig C: Start bidding conservatively, just above the starting price, to gauge the interest of other bidders. If the bidding doesn't escalate, gradually increase your bid to secure the item at a price below your estimated value.","2":"Contraption I and Apparatus H: For these items, consider the potential competition from Bidder 3. If you believe they might be interested, be prepared to bid more aggressively, but don't exceed your estimated value.","3":"Element R and Appliance O: These items have higher starting prices and estimated values. If you have enough budget left after securing the alternative targets, bid cautiously on these items, as they could lead to high profits if won at a reasonable price.","4":"Bid Limit Calculation: For each item, calculate a bid limit by subtracting a buffer from your estimated value. The buffer should be a percentage of the estimated value to account for potential overestimation or competition.","5":"Reserve Some Budget: Keep a contingency budget for unexpected bidding wars or items that may have a higher true value than initially estimated.","6":"Risk Assessment: Be prepared to let go of items if the bidding exceeds your estimated value by a significant margin, based on the experience with Utensil N.","7":"Priority Items: Focus on the items with the highest estimated values, such as Implement G, Unit Q, Machine P, Mechanism J, Element R, and Appliance O, but be mindful of Bidder 2's potential interest in these items.","8":"Lower-Priority Items: Be more selective and potentially more aggressive for items with lower estimated values, if the bidding stays low and within your estimated value.","9":"Estimate Adjustments: Since Bidder 2 has shown a willingness to bid aggressively on items with similar estimated values as Bidder 4 (Doodad D and Mechanism J), it's wise to revise the estimated values for the remaining items they might be interested in (Gizmo F and Appliance O). Bidder 4 should consider adding a premium to account for potential competition from Bidder 2, especially if the starting prices are low.","10":"Bid Strategy: For Gizmo F and Appliance O, Bidder 4 should be more cautious with their bids, as they expect higher competition from Bidder 2. They should consider bidding just enough to outbid Bidder 2, but not so much that it significantly reduces their profit margin.","11":"Patience: Don't feel pressured to bid on every item. If the bidding on Gizmo F, Appliance O, or Element R becomes too intense, it's better to conserve the budget for later items or potential re-bids on items that didn't sell due to lack of competition.","12":"Bidder 1 Analysis: Bidder 1 seems to be targeting lower-priced items with higher profit margins. They have a remaining budget of $1700, which suggests they may not be a significant threat for higher-priced items. However, keep an eye on them for items with similar price ranges to Gadget B and Thingamajig C.","13":"Reassess Budget: After winning Apparatus H, Bidder 4 has a remaining budget of $8200. This should be carefully managed for the remaining items.","14":"Don't Overbid: Remember the lesson from losing out on Equipment E and Contraption I. Don't get too attached to a specific item, as it could lead to overbidding and reduced profits.","15":"Manage Risk: If you lose out on Element R, focus on Gizmo F and Appliance O. If all high-value items are won by others, shift your focus to securing items with moderate estimated values that still offer a profit margin.","16":"Anticipate True Values: Consider that the true values of the remaining items might not match your estimates. Be prepared to adjust your bids if the bidding exceeds your perceived value.","17":"Timing: As before, time your bids strategically to avoid driving up the price. Wait for other bidders to reveal their interest before placing a bid, and only increase your bid if it's still within your maximum limit.","18":"New Maximum Bid Limits: For the remaining items, set new maximum bid limits that are closer to your estimated values, with a smaller buffer. For example, if your estimated value is $X, consider setting your maximum bid at $X - 10% to $X - 20% to account for potential overestimation.","19":"Estimate True Value Ranges: Based on the observed true values, create a range for each remaining item, considering a lower bound that's slightly below the starting price and an upper bound that's slightly above your estimated value.","20":"Gadget B, Widget A, Thingamajig C: These items have lower estimated values. Bid up to $1900 for Gadget B and Widget A, and $2100 for Thingamajig C, considering a $100 buffer. These items can be good opportunities to increase your profit if the bidding stays low.","21":"Contraption I, Apparatus H: With estimated values of $6600, bid up to $5600, leaving a $1000 buffer. These items can be potential profit sources if the bidding doesn't escalate too high.","22":"Set stricter bidding thresholds: Bid no more than 90% of the estimated value for each item to avoid overbidding and ensure better budget management.","23":"Flexibility: Be prepared to adapt your strategy as the auction progresses. If you lose out on Appliance O, Gizmo F could become a more attractive option, or you might choose to conserve your budget for future auctions.","24":"Bid Aggressively but Strategically: Since you're behind in profit, you may need to bid more aggressively on the high-value items, but be careful not to overbid. Set a maximum bid limit based on your estimated value with a buffer for potential overestimation.","25":"Risk-Taking: Given your current position, you may need to take calculated risks to catch up. This could mean bidding slightly above your estimated value if you believe the true value is higher or if it's necessary to outbid a competitor.","26":"Avoid Overextending: While you need to be more aggressive, don't overextend yourself. Ensure you have enough budget to bid on the remaining high-value items.","27":"Assess risk and reward: Weigh the potential profit against the risk of overbidding for items with lower estimated values. Consider letting these items go if the bidding exceeds the 90% threshold.","28":"Maintain Budget Discipline: With a remaining budget of $11,300, Bidder 4 should be cautious not to overspend on any single item. Given the high estimated values for some upcoming items, it's crucial to conserve funds for the more valuable lots.","29":"Estimate True Value Ranges: Since the true values are unknown, Bidder 4 should try to estimate a range based on the bidding behavior of others. For example, if the starting bid for Apparatus H is $3000, and Bidder 1 or 2 has shown interest in similar items, Bidder 4 should be prepared for a higher final price.","30":"Value Focus: Prioritize bidding on items with high estimated values relative to their starting prices. This includes Contraption I, Apparatus H, Gizmo F, and Appliance O.","31":"Risk Assessment: Consider the bidding history of other bidders. If Bidder 3 seems to be targeting high-value items, be prepared for potential bidding wars with them on Element R and Appliance O.","32":"Reassess Bid Strategy: Given that Bidder 3 has been more aggressive and successful, Bidder 4 should be more cautious in bidding wars with Bidder 3. This might mean setting a higher buffer between the estimated value and the maximum bid, especially for items with high estimated values.","33":"Learn from Past Mistakes: The loss of Doodad D and Mechanism J to Bidder 2 at relatively low prices suggests that Bidder 4 might have been too conservative. It's essential to strike a balance between not overbidding and being assertive enough to secure high-value items.","34":"Risk Management: Given the high true value of Utensil N and Implement G, Bidder 4 has already made some profitable purchases. It's crucial to manage risk by not overextending the budget on the remaining items, especially if the true value is uncertain.","35":"Estimate Competition: {'Thingamajig C': 'With a low starting price, it might attract multiple bidders, including Bidder 1, who has shown interest in lower-priced items.', 'Apparatus H': 'With a mid-range starting price, it could be less competitive if Bidder 3 focuses on higher-priced items.', 'Element R': 'Given its high starting price, it might be a target for Bidder 3, but could be less competitive if they have exhausted their budget.', 'Gizmo F': 'Similar to Thingamajig C, it could attract multiple bidders, including Bidder 1.', 'Appliance O': 'With a high starting price, it could be a target for Bidder 3 if they still have a significant budget.'}","36":"Bidder 3 Analysis: Keep a close eye on Bidder 3's aggressive bidding behavior, especially for Element R, as they might be interested in it as well.","37":"Secure Gizmo F if it becomes more profitable than the remaining items.: Since the starting price is low, bid just above the starting price to secure the item if no other bidders show interest. If there is competition, evaluate the bids in relation to your estimated value and adjust accordingly. If the bidding exceeds your estimated value, prioritize the higher-value items (like Appliance O) or save your budget for future rounds.","38":"Patience: Don't rush into bidding wars. Wait for the right moment to bid, and if the item is not won, be prepared to move on to the next high-value item.","39":"Bid Threshold for Appliance O: Given Bidder 2's behavior, set a higher bid threshold for Appliance O. You might need to bid more aggressively to outbid them, but don't exceed your estimated value plus a reasonable buffer to account for potential overestimation.","40":"Appliance O Priority: Since Appliance O is your top priority with an estimated value of $8800, allocate at least $4000 to ensure you can bid on it, leaving a remaining budget of $4200 for other items.","41":"Bid Increment Strategy: Given the remaining budget, be cautious with bid increments for items with a starting price below $4000. Consider bidding in smaller increments to stay competitive while preserving funds for Appliance O.","42":"Competitor Analysis: Observe the bidding behavior of other bidders, especially Bidder 3, who has been more aggressive and has a higher total profit. If they show interest in Appliance O, be prepared to bid more aggressively to secure it.","43":"Budget Buffer: Maintain a small budget buffer for unexpected bidding situations or potential reserve prices. This could mean bidding slightly below your allocated budget for Appliance O to ensure you have some funds for contingencies.","44":"Profitability: For the remaining items, prioritize those with a higher potential for profit, considering the true value you don't know. Bid conservatively, aiming to win items at a price below your estimated value.","45":"Risk Management: Be prepared to let go of Appliance O if Bidder 2's bidding becomes too aggressive or if the price exceeds your estimated value plus buffer. Focus on maximizing profit overall, not just on winning a specific item.","46":"Set a Bid Limit: Given your estimated value of $8800 for Appliance O, set a maximum bid limit slightly below this value, say $8600, to account for potential overestimation and to ensure you don't overpay.","47":"Initial Bid: Start with a bid slightly above the starting price, say $4100, to signal your interest without immediately pushing the price too high.","48":"Risk Tolerance: Determine your risk tolerance for overpaying. If the bidding exceeds $6000, consider whether the potential profit is worth the risk, given your current total profit of $11,800.","49":"Patience: Be patient and wait for other bidders to reveal their interest and bidding patterns. If no one else bids after your initial bid, you might win the item at a lower price.","50":"Monitor Budget: Keep a close eye on your remaining budget ($11300) and adjust your bidding strategy accordingly. If you win other items before Appliance O, ensure you have enough funds left to bid competitively.","51":"Assess Risk: Consider the risk of overpaying for Appliance O compared to the potential profit. If the bidding surpasses your estimated value by a significant margin, it might be more prudent to conserve your budget for other items with better profit potential.","52":"Bid Strategy for High-Value Items: {'Apparatus H': 'Given its starting price of $3,000 and your estimated value of $6,600, bid conservatively, but be prepared to increase your bid if the price remains below your estimated value.', 'Gizmo F': 'With a starting price of $2,000 and an estimated value of $4,400, bid aggressively to secure this item if the bidding stays within your estimated value.', 'Thingamajig C': \"Since it has a low starting price of $1,000 and an estimated value of $2,200, bid early to secure the item if there's little competition.\"}","53":"Competitive Analysis: Observe the bidding patterns of Bidder 3, who has been successful in securing high-value items. If they show interest in any of your alternative targets, be prepared to adjust your strategy or consider alternative items.","54":"Risk Assessment: Be cautious with bids, considering potential deviation between estimated values and true values, and be prepared to withdraw if bidding exceeds comfort level.","55":"Price Trends: Observe the price increments and winning bids for similar items. For example, if items with starting prices around $2000 have been selling for around $2500, it might indicate that bidders are willing to pay a premium. Adjust your estimate for Gizmo F accordingly.","56":"Budget Constraints: Consider the remaining budgets of other bidders. Bidder 1 has the least amount left, which might limit their bidding on higher-priced items. Bidder 3, with the most budget, could be a strong competitor for Appliance O.","57":"Profit Margins: Reflect on the profit margins you've achieved so far. If you've been successful in securing items with good profit margins, you might want to be more conservative with your bids on Gizmo F and Appliance O to maintain your overall profit.","58":"Risk Tolerance: Assess your risk tolerance. If you've already won several items and are satisfied with your current profit, you might want to be more cautious to avoid overpaying. If you're looking to maximize your total profit, you might be more willing to bid aggressively.","59":"Market Correction: If the true values of items have been consistently lower than your estimates, consider revising your estimates for Gizmo F and Appliance O downward to account for potential overestimation.","60":"Bidder Fatigue: As the auction progresses, bidders might become more selective or less aggressive. This could affect the bidding on the remaining items, so factor this into your strategy.","61":"Risk Assessment: Given that you've won items with a total value of $11,800 (Utensil N, Implement G, and Apparatus H), you're currently in a profitable position. However, Bidder 3 has the highest total profit. Be cautious not to overbid and risk losing your profit margin.","62":"Budget Allocation: Prioritize items with a lower starting price and a higher estimated value relative to its starting price.","63":"Endgame Focus: Focus more on the items with the highest potential for profit, given your remaining budget.","64":"Loss Prevention: Prioritize preserving your budget for future auctions or for items with higher profit potential, rather than trying to win at all costs.","65":"Apparatus H: With a starting price of $3000 and an estimated value of $6600, you have a good profit opportunity. Bid up to $6500, leaving a $1000 buffer. However, consider the bidding competition and adjust your bid accordingly.","66":"Apparatus H: {'Set maximum bid limit': 'Set a maximum bid limit of $6100 to account for a $500 buffer.', 'Observe bidding behavior': 'Observe the bidding behavior of other bidders, especially Bidder 3, who has been more aggressive.', 'Be prepared to withdraw': 'If the bidding exceeds $6100, be prepared to withdraw to avoid overpaying.'}","67":"Budget Management: {'Maintain conservative approach': 'Maintain a conservative approach to bidding, ensuring you have enough budget for the higher-value items.', 'Be prepared to let go of lower-value items': 'Be prepared to let go of items with lower estimated values if the bidding becomes too competitive.', 'Monitor total profits': 'Monitor your total profits and adjust your bidding strategy accordingly.'}","68":"Risk Management: Given that Bidder 3 has the highest total profit and Bidder 2 is also competitive, be cautious not to overbid and risk losing your remaining budget. Focus on the items with the best potential for profit while staying within your budget.","69":"Learn from Past Bids: Analyze the bidding patterns of other bidders. If they tend to withdraw quickly, you might be able to win items with a slightly lower bid than your estimated value. If they are more competitive, be prepared to bid closer to your estimated value.","70":"Thingamajig C: As a low-priced item with a starting price of $1000 and an estimated value of $2200, it offers a decent profit margin. However, be cautious, as low-priced items often attract more competition. Bid only if you can secure it at a price below your estimated value.","71":"Element R: With a starting price of $5000 and an estimated value of $11000, this item has a high profit margin. However, consider the competition from Bidder 3, who has shown a willingness to bid aggressively on high-priced items. Bid cautiously, but be prepared to engage if the price remains within your comfort zone.","72":"Gizmo F: This item has a moderate profit margin with a starting price of $2000 and an estimated value of $4400. It could be a good opportunity if you can secure it at a reasonable price. Monitor the bidding and bid accordingly.","73":"Appliance O: As a higher-priced item with a starting price of $4000 and an estimated value of $8800, it offers a high profit margin. However, be mindful of Bidder 3, who has won multiple high-priced items. Bid competitively but don't exceed your estimated value.","74":"Guidelines: {'Budget Management': 'Keep track of your remaining budget ($11300) and prioritize items with higher profit margins while ensuring you have enough funds for potential higher bids.', 'Bid Increment Awareness': 'Be aware of the bid increments to avoid overbidding and to stay competitive without overpaying.', 'Competitive Analysis': 'Observe the bidding behavior of Bidder 3, who has been active and successful in high-priced items, and adjust your strategy accordingly.', 'Risk Assessment': 'Be prepared to let go of an item if the bidding exceeds your estimated value, as overpaying can lead to negative profit.', 'Timing': 'Bid at the right moment to avoid driving up the price unnecessarily, but be ready to act quickly if the item is about to be lost to another bidder.'}","75":"Avoid Overlap: Consider targeting items that don't overlap with the interests of strong competitors to minimize competition.","76":"Learn from past bidding patterns: Observe how other bidders have behaved and adjust your strategy accordingly.","77":"Implement G: Since you've already won this item, your goal is to ensure a positive profit. You've spent $3800, and with an estimated value of $6600, you've made a profit of $2800. No further action is needed for this item.","78":"Budget Allocation: After winning Implement G and bidding on Machine P, you have $11300 remaining. Given the high value of some upcoming items, prioritize bidding on Mechanism J, Gizmo F, and Appliance O, as they have the highest estimated values.","79":"Bid Increment Strategy: Be mindful of bid increments to avoid overbidding. For Gizmo F, if the bidding starts at $2000, bid in increments that align with the auction rules but avoid overshooting your target bid.","80":"If you don't win Gizmo F, prioritize Apparatus H as the next target.: Set a maximum bid of $5600 to ensure a profit, but be cautious of overbidding due to potential competition.","81":"Budget Allocation: Allocate the remaining budget of $8200 wisely to target high-value items without overextending yourself.","82":"High-Value Target: Target Appliance O with an estimated value of $8800 and a starting price of $4000 to potentially maximize profit.","83":"Backup Plan: If you miss out on Appliance O, consider bidding on lower-value items with high estimated values, like Gizmo F, if it hasn't been auctioned yet. Set a maximum bid based on your estimated value with a buffer.","84":"Post-Auction Analysis: After the auction, evaluate your performance and learn from your bidding decisions to refine your strategy for future auctions.","85":"Monitor your budget: Keep track of your remaining budget and adjust your bidding strategy accordingly.","86":"Profit Maximization: Aim to win items that will maximize your profit margin while staying within your budget. Be prepared to let go of items if the bidding exceeds your estimated value minus a buffer.","87":"Bid Aggressively on High-Value Items: Since you have a higher estimated value for Element R, Gizmo F, and Appliance O, be prepared to bid more aggressively on these items, but don't exceed your estimated value minus a safety buffer.","88":"Mid-Value Items Strategy: For Contraption I and Apparatus H, bid conservatively, trying to secure them at a price below or near your estimated value. Monitor the bidding behavior of other bidders to gauge their interest and adjust your bids accordingly.","89":"Monitor Your Competitors: Keep an eye on the remaining budgets of other bidders. If they seem to be running low on funds, you might have an advantage in bidding on certain items.","90":"Risk assessment: For items with a starting price close to or higher than your estimated value (e.g., Unit Q, Machine P, Element R), assess the risk of overpaying. If the starting price is already close to your maximum bid limit, be cautious.","91":"Budget allocation: As the auction progresses, adjust your budget allocation based on the remaining items and your current profit. If you win a high-value item, you may need to be more conservative with the remaining items to ensure you have enough budget for the endgame.","92":"Maintain Profit Margin: Since you have a profit of $3100 from Utensil N, prioritize maintaining a healthy profit margin. Don't overbid on items, especially if Bidder 2 is not actively bidding.","93":"Monitor Bidder 2: Keep a close eye on Bidder 2's bids, especially on the items mentioned above.","94":"Bid Strategically: If you also value these items highly, consider bidding slightly below your estimated value to avoid a bidding war with Bidder 2, especially if you think they might have a higher budget.","95":"Budget Allocation: Since Bidder 2 has shown a preference for high-value items, you might want to prioritize bidding on items with lower starting prices and high estimated values to maximize your profit potential while conserving your budget.","96":"Bidder 2's Risk Appetite: Consider the possibility that Bidder 2 might withdraw from items with high competition due to lower risk tolerance.","97":"Learn from Bidder 2's approach: Bidder 2's profit margins suggest a disciplined bidding strategy. Bidder 4 should consider adopting a similar approach, bidding conservatively and not overpaying for items.","98":"Monitor true values: Keep track of the hammer prices to estimate the true values of the items. This can help refine your bidding strategy and adjust your maximum bid limits accordingly.","99":"Bidder 3's Behavior: Bidder 3 has bid aggressively on high-priced items, winning Unit Q and Machine P. They have spent $12500, leaving them with a smaller budget of $7500. This suggests they may be less of a threat for the remaining items, especially the lower-priced ones.","100":"Your Own Strategy: Given your current budget of $11300, you need to be more cautious with your bids. Focus on items with high estimated values and low starting prices, where you can potentially make a good profit margin.","101":"Anticipate Bidding Wars: Be prepared for bidding wars with Bidder 2, especially on items like Gizmo F, Apparatus H, and Appliance O, which have high estimated values for both of you.","102":"Learn from Past Bids: Analyze the bidding patterns of Bidder 2 and 3 to predict their behavior on future items. If they tend to bid aggressively early on, you might want to bid slightly higher initially to deter them.","103":"Profit Margin Focus: Focus on items with the highest profit margins to maximize your overall profit.","104":"Bidder 2 Behavior: Monitor Bidder 2's behavior, but currently, they may not be as significant a threat.","105":"Budget Allocation: After winning Implement G, you have $11300 left. Allocate your budget wisely, prioritizing items with higher estimated values and lower starting prices.","106":"Bid Ceilings: Set personal bid ceilings for each item based on your estimated value and the current bidding situation. This will help you maintain discipline and avoid overpaying.","107":"Bidder 1 Observation: Since Bidder 1 has no winning bids, they might be more aggressive in the upcoming rounds. Keep an eye on their behavior.","108":"Bid Incrementally: If Bidder 2 re-enters the bidding, increase your bids incrementally, only enough to outbid them, but not exceeding your estimated value for the item.","109":"Low-Value Items: For items with lower estimated values, like Gadget B, Widget A, Thingamajig C, and Gizmo F, consider if it's worth bidding against Bidder 2. If their presence doesn't significantly impact your overall profit, you might choose to let them win these items.","110":"Estimate True Values: Use the hammer prices of the previous items to refine your estimate of the true value range. For example, Doodad D sold for $2500, which was $1000 less than its true value, suggesting that bidders might be underestimating values.","111":"Risk Assessment: Assess the risk of losing an item if you wait too long. If an item has a high estimated value and low starting price, consider bidding earlier to secure it if you think other bidders might be interested.","112":"Budget Allocation: You have $11,300 remaining. Given your previous bids, it's crucial to allocate this budget wisely to items with high estimated values and low starting prices to maximize profit margins.","113":"Lower-Priced Opportunities: Consider bidding on Gadget B, Widget A, Thingamajig C, Gizmo F, and Appliance O, as they have lower starting prices and could provide good profit margins with lower risk.","114":"High-Value Targets: For high-value items like Machine P, Mechanism J, and Element R, bid conservatively but competitively, as they have the potential for significant profit if won at the right price.","115":"Profit vs. Quantity: Balance the desire to win more items with the need to maximize profit per item. Winning more items may not necessarily lead to higher overall profit if you overpay for them.","116":"Competitor Analysis: Bidder 2 has a profit of $1,500 and seems to be competitive. Monitor their bidding behavior, but don't let their actions dictate your bidding decisions. Focus on your own profitability.","117":"Risk Assessment: Assess the risk of overpaying for an item based on the deviation between your estimated value and the true value. Be prepared to let go of an item if the price exceeds your comfort level.","118":"Anticipate Competition: If Bidder 2 has a pattern of bidding on items with similar characteristics to those you value highly, be prepared to adapt your strategy to counter their actions.","119":"Retain a Safety Net: Keep a portion of your budget as a safety net for the end of the auction, when you might need to bid more aggressively on high-value items to outbid Bidder 2 or other bidders.","120":"Prioritize high-value items: Focus on Utensil N, Equipment E, Implement G, Unit Q, Machine P, Mechanism J, Element R, Gizmo F, and Appliance O, as they have higher estimated values and potentially higher profit margins.","121":"Monitor Bidder 2's budget: If Bidder 2 continues to win high-value items, it may indicate they have a larger budget or are more risk-tolerant. Adjust your bidding strategy accordingly, potentially being more aggressive on items they don't seem interested in.","122":"Don't overcommit early: Save some budget for later items, as the competition might thin out as the auction progresses, allowing you to secure items at better prices.","123":"Be prepared to walk away: If the bidding exceeds your maximum bid limit, don't hesitate to withdraw from the auction for that item. Your primary goal is to maximize profit, not to win at all costs.","124":"Bid competitively: Observe the bidding behavior of other bidders and adjust your limits accordingly, especially if you notice that their estimated values might be lower.","125":"Budget Allocation: After winning Utensil N, you have $15100 left. Allocate your budget wisely, prioritizing the high-value items with low starting prices. Consider the remaining items' estimated values and starting prices to determine your bidding strategy.","126":"Risk Assessment: For Implement G and Gizmo F, assess the risk of overpaying. If the bidding goes too high, be prepared to let these items go to avoid potential losses.","127":"Flexibility: If Bidder 2 or other bidders show strong interest in high-value items, pivot your strategy to focus on items with less competition or slightly lower estimated values but still offer a good profit margin.","128":"Bid Strategically on Mid-Value Items: For Appliance O, Gadget B, Widget A, Thingamajig C, Contraption I, Mechanism J, and Apparatus H, bid conservatively, waiting for other bidders to drop out before increasing your bid.","129":"Budget Management: Prioritize items that offer the best potential for profit while ensuring you have enough funds for the rest of the auction. Consider setting a maximum bid limit for each item based on your estimated value and the remaining budget.","130":"Risk Assessment: Be cautious with items where your estimated value is close to the starting price, as they have a higher risk of resulting in a low or negative profit.","131":"Risk Assessment: Be prepared to let go of an item if the bidding exceeds your maximum bid limit or if you sense a bidding war is about to erupt.","132":"Bid Increment Awareness: Understand the bid increments to avoid overbidding unnecessarily. Be aware of the minimum amount you need to bid to outbid competitors without exceeding your estimated value.","133":"Bidder 1 and 3's Withdrawals: Both bidders withdrew after the first round of bidding on Doodad D. This could indicate that they have lower estimated values for the item or are more cautious with their bidding. However, it's essential to monitor their behavior in future rounds, as they might be more aggressive on items they value highly.","134":"Budget Allocation: Divide your remaining budget among the high-value items based on their estimated values and your confidence in those estimates. Prioritize items with the highest potential for profit.","135":"Timing: Bid at the last possible moment to minimize the chances of a bidding war and to force other bidders to reveal their maximum bid.","136":"Bidder 2's Budget: Bidder 2 has a profit of $1500 from Doodad D, which means they spent $1000 more than the starting price. This could affect their budget for future items, potentially making them less competitive or more selective.","137":"Bidder 1 and 3's Budgets: Since they didn't win any items, their budgets are likely intact. They could still be significant competitors, especially if they have high estimated values for upcoming items.","138":"Timing: Observe when other bidders are choosing to bid and when they withdraw. If they tend to bid early, consider waiting until the last moment to bid, as this can sometimes deter others from increasing their bids.","139":"Set Bid Ceilings: For each remaining item, set a bid ceiling based on your estimated value minus a safety margin. For example, for Utensil N, your bid ceiling could be $8500 (8800 - 300), allowing for a 3% buffer in case your estimate is too high.","140":"Item Prioritization: Rank the remaining items by their estimated value and the potential for profit. Focus on the top items first, as they offer the highest potential for maximizing profit.","141":"Bidder Behavior: Track the bidding behavior of the remaining bidders. If Bidder 3 or Bidder 4 (yourself) tend to bid aggressively, it could suggest a higher perceived value for the items. Conversely, if bidders tend to withdraw quickly, it might indicate that their estimated values are lower.","142":"Bid Adjustments: If you notice a pattern of overestimating item values, adjust your bids accordingly. Be more conservative in your bidding to avoid overpaying.","143":"Learning from Mistakes: Reflect on the Doodad D and Utensil N auctions. If you overbid for Utensil N, consider how you can apply the lessons learned to future bids. For instance, you might want to be more cautious with items that have a similar estimated value to Utensil N.","144":"Risk vs. Reward: Weigh the potential profit against the risk of overpaying. If the risk is high, it might be better to conserve your budget for later items with a higher potential for profit.","145":"Budget Allocation: After Doodad D, you have $17800 left. Allocate this budget across the remaining items, prioritizing those with higher estimated values and lower starting prices.","146":"Avoid Bidding Wars: If a bidding war seems imminent, assess whether the potential profit is worth the risk. If not, let the item go and focus on the next one.","147":"Learn from Past Bids: Analyze why you withdrew from Doodad D. If it was due to a conservative bid, consider being more assertive in the future. If it was because the price exceeded your estimated value, maintain your discipline.","148":"Patience and Selectivity: Don't feel compelled to bid on every item. Be selective and patient, focusing on the items that offer the best potential for profit.","149":"Bid with a buffer: Since you have a $20,000 budget and haven't won any items yet, you can afford to be more aggressive in your bidding. However, always leave a buffer between your estimated value and your bid to account for potential overestimation.","150":"Assess the competition's budget: Based on the current profits, Bidder 1 and Bidder 3 have not won any items, while Bidder 2 has spent $1500. This information can help you estimate their remaining budgets and adjust your bidding accordingly.","151":"Reserve Prices: If there are reserve prices for any items, try to estimate them and factor them into your bidding strategy. This can help you avoid bidding on items that won't be sold at your bid.","152":"Flexibility: Be prepared to adjust your strategy as the auction progresses, based on the actual bids and the behavior of other bidders.","153":"Endgame Strategy: As the auction nears its end and your budget dwindles, prioritize the remaining items with the highest potential for profit and adjust your bidding accordingly."}},"arms_cnt":{"Bidder 1":[],"Bidder 2":[],"Bidder 3":[],"Bidder 4":[1,10,30,44,55,65,78,80,91,98,111,119,124,137,145,154]},"model_info":{"Bidder 1":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 2":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 3":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 4":"qwen-72b"}}
