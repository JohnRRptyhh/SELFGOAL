This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Set new maximum bid limits: For each remaining item, set a new maximum bid limit that includes a buffer. For example, for Thingamajig C, the new limit could be $2420 ($2200 + 10% buffer). For Utensil N, it could be $9680 ($8800 + 10% buffer), and so on.\n - Budget Allocation: Reallocate your budget based on the bidding outcomes of high-value items. If you miss out on one, shift your focus and budget to the next high-value item on your list.\n - Monitor Bidder 1: Since Bidder 1 has shown a willingness to bid aggressively, keep an eye on their behavior. If they seem to be targeting the same high-value items as you, be prepared to adjust your strategy or focus on items they may be less interested in.\n - Bid conservatively: Start bidding below your maximum bid limit to avoid immediate competition. This will allow you to gauge the interest of other bidders and potentially win the item at a lower price.\n - Learn from Past Bids: Analyze the bidding patterns of previous items to predict how other bidders might behave in the future. This can help you time your bids more effectively and avoid unnecessary bidding wars.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $20000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $4000\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Unit Q: $6000\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

The priority list should be updated to reflect the items that are now unavailable and the potential competition from Bidder 1 and Bidder 3.

Bid on them if there's enough budget left after securing the high-priority items and if the competition for those items becomes too intense.\n\nGiven the new developments, it's important to monitor Bidder 3's behavior and adjust bidding strategies accordingly.

Remember, the goal is to maximize overall profit, not to win every item.\n - Long-term Focus: Maintain a long-term perspective, considering the cumulative profit from all items rather than focusing on individual wins.

This suggests that your estimate was too low, and you need to account for potential overestimation by other bidders. Consider adding a buffer to your maximum bid limit, perhaps 10-20% more than your estimated value.\n - Revised Budget: Allocate a revised budget for the remaining high-value items. Since you've spent $4900, you have $15100 left. Prioritize the items with the highest estimated value relative to their starting price.\n - High-Value Targets: Your high-value targets are: Element R (estimated value $11000, starting price $5000), Machine P (estimated value $11000, starting price $5000), Contraption I (estimated value $6600, starting price $3000), Mechanism J (estimated value $8800, starting price $4000), Appliance O (estimated value $8800, starting price $4000).\n - Budget Reallocation: Be more cautious with your bidding on the remaining items if you've won items with thin profit margins to ensure a better overall profit distribution.\n - Anticipate Dropouts: As the auction continues, some bidders might run out of budget or lose interest. This could create opportunities to acquire items at lower prices. Be prepared to bid opportunistically when this happens.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $11600\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $4000\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $800\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Unit Q: $6000\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * Thingamajig C: $1200\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Utensil N: $4900\n    * Contraption I: $3500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Learn from the previous round: Observe that you withdrew from Unit Q at $5100, while Bidder 1 won it at $6000. This suggests that your estimate was too low, and you need to account for potential overestimation by other bidders. Consider adding a buffer to your maximum bid limit, perhaps 10-20% more than your estimated value.\n - Revised Budget: Allocate a revised budget for the remaining high-value items. Since you've spent $4900, you have $15100 left. Prioritize the items with the highest estimated value relative to their starting price.\n - High-Value Targets: Your high-value targets are: Element R (estimated value $11000, starting price $5000), Machine P (estimated value $11000, starting price $5000), Contraption I (estimated value $6600, starting price $3000), Mechanism J (estimated value $8800, starting price $4000), Appliance O (estimated value $8800, starting price $4000).\n - Budget Reallocation: Be more cautious with your bidding on the remaining items if you've won items with thin profit margins to ensure a better overall profit distribution.\n - Anticipate Dropouts: As the auction continues, some bidders might run out of budget or lose interest. This could create opportunities to acquire items at lower prices. Be prepared to bid opportunistically when this happens.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Machine P:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $5500\n- Bidder 3: $5500\n- Bidder 4: $5100\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Machine P, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Machine P. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.

Bidder 3, with a focus on lower-value items, might be more competitive for Gizmo F, Gadget B, and Doodad D.\n - Profit Margin Calculation: For each item, calculate the maximum bid you're willing to make based on your estimated value and a buffer for potential overestimation.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Assess Risk: Evaluate the risk of overpaying for an item. If the starting price is close to or exceeds your estimated value, consider passing on that item unless you have strong reason to believe its true value is higher.\n - End-game Focus: Focus more on the remaining high-value items and your remaining budget as the auction progresses to make the most of your resources in the final stages.\n - Profit vs. Participation: If you reach a point where winning an item would barely contribute to your profit or even result in a loss, consider letting it go to conserve your budget for more profitable opportunities.\n - Competitor Analysis: Observe the bidding patterns of other bidders. If Bidder 1 seems to be targeting high-value items, they might be a competitor for Appliance O and Implement G. Bidder 3, with a focus on lower-value items, might be more competitive for Gizmo F, Gadget B, and Doodad D.\n - Profit Margin Calculation: For each item, calculate the maximum bid you're willing to make based on your estimated value and a buffer for potential overestimation.
