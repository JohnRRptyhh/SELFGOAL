Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Bid Strategy Development: Develop a bidding strategy that allows you to bid conservatively, ensuring that you don't overpay for any item. This could involve setting a maximum bid limit for each item based on your estimated value, with a buffer to account for potential overestimation.\n - Budget Management: Allocate your budget efficiently across the items, prioritizing those with the highest estimated value relative to their starting price. This will help you stay competitive while avoiding overspending.\n - Observation and Learning: Observe the bidding behavior of other participants to understand their valuations and thresholds. This can help you gauge when to bid, when to hold back, and potentially identify opportunities to outbid others strategically.\n - Risk Assessment: Assess the risk associated with each item, considering the potential deviation between your estimated value and the true market value. Higher-risk items may require more cautious bidding.\n - Patience and Discipline: Exercise patience, waiting for the right moment to bid and avoiding getting caught up in bidding wars. Stick to your pre-determined strategy and avoid emotional decisions.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"As Bidder 4, you have a total budget of $20000.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Estimate Adjustments: Reflect on the previous bidding patterns. If you consistently overbid the true value (Widget A and Element R), consider adjusting your estimated values downward for future items to account for potential overestimation.\n - Bid Ceilings: Establish bid ceilings for each item, which should be below your adjusted estimated value. This will help you avoid overpaying and ensure you have enough budget for later items.\n - Budget Allocation: Allocate your remaining budget strategically, prioritizing items with higher estimated values and lower starting prices. This will maximize your chances of making a profit while ensuring you don't exhaust your budget too quickly.\n - Bid at the Right Time: Observe the bidding patterns of other bidders and time your bids to maximize their impact. Bid just enough to outbid the current highest bidder, but not so much that you risk eroding your profit margin.\n - Priority List: Rank the remaining items by their estimated value-to-starting price ratio and your personal preference. Focus on the top items first, as they offer the highest potential for profit.

You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Estimate Adjustments: Reflect on the previous bidding patterns. If you consistently overbid the true value (Widget A and Element R), consider adjusting your estimated values downward for future items to account for potential overestimation.\n - Bid Ceilings: Establish bid ceilings for each item, which should be below your adjusted estimated value. This will help you avoid overpaying and ensure you have enough budget for later items.\n - Budget Allocation: Allocate your remaining budget strategically, prioritizing items with higher estimated values and lower starting prices. This will maximize your chances of making a profit while ensuring you don't exhaust your budget too quickly.\n - Bid at the Right Time: Observe the bidding patterns of other bidders and time your bids to maximize their impact. Bid just enough to outbid the current highest bidder, but not so much that you risk eroding your profit margin.\n - Priority List: Rank the remaining items by their estimated value-to-starting price ratio and your personal preference. Focus on the top items first, as they offer the highest potential for profit.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Revised Estimated Values: Given the observed bidding behavior, reevaluate estimated values for remaining items considering potential for higher bids from competitors. Add a smaller buffer to account for increased competition.\n - Revised Bid Thresholds: Since you've spent $12,100 and have a remaining budget of $4,100, adjust your bidding thresholds for the remaining items. For instance, for items with an estimated value of $4400, you might want to set a maximum bid of around $3,500 to account for the reduced budget and potential overestimation.\n - Priority List: Reorder your priority list of remaining items based on their adjusted estimated values and the potential for profit, considering your reduced budget. For example, Utensil N, Machine P, and Contraption I might be higher priorities due to their higher estimated values.\n - Bid Conservatively on Lower-Value Items: For items with lower estimated values, bid more conservatively to minimize risk. This will help you conserve your budget for higher-potential items.\n - Profit Maximization: If you win Doodad D at your bid ceiling, your profit would be $4400 - $4200 = $200. Compare this potential profit with the potential profits from the upcoming items, especially Utensil N, Apparatus H, Machine P, and Implement G, which have higher estimated values.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Doodad D:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $2200\n- Bidder 3: $2200\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Doodad D, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Doodad D. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.
