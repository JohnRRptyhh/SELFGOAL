Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Bid Strategy Development: Develop a bidding strategy that allows you to bid effectively without overpaying. This could involve setting a maximum bid limit for each item based on your estimated value, ensuring you don't exceed your budget, and considering the potential competition for each item.\n - Budget Management: Allocate your budget wisely across the items, considering the potential resale value and your estimated values. You want to ensure you have enough funds to bid on the items with the highest potential profit margins.\n - Competitive Analysis: Observe and analyze the bidding behavior of other bidders to gauge their interest and estimated values for the items. This can help you determine when to bid, when to hold back, and when to drop out of a bidding war.\n - Timing: Time your bids strategically to avoid driving up the price unnecessarily. Bid just enough to outbid the current highest bidder but not so much that you push the price beyond the item's estimated value.\n - Priority Ranking: Rank the items based on their potential profit and importance to your overall strategy. Focus on the top-ranked items first, as they are more likely to contribute significantly to your overall profit.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"As Bidder 4, you have a total budget of $20000.

If the bidding on an item is getting too close to your maximum bid, consider dropping out to preserve your budget for other items with better profit margins.\n - Maintain a reserve for high-value items: Since you have a significant budget remaining ($20,000) and several high-value items are yet to come, it's crucial to conserve funds for these items.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - High-Value Targeting: Focus on the high-value items (Appliance O, Mechanism J, Machine P, and Utensil N) where your estimated values exceed $8000. These have the potential to generate the highest profit margins.\n - Risk Assessment: Given that Bidder 3 has won Unit Q at a high price, they might be less competitive on items with lower estimated values. This could create opportunities for you to bid on items like Gizmo F, Contraption I, and Doodad D with less competition.\n - Bid Aggressively on Appliance O: With an estimated value of $8800 and a starting price of $4000, Appliance O is a high-priority item. Bid aggressively to secure it, but don't exceed your estimated value. Be prepared to engage in a bidding war if necessary, as it has the potential for a high profit margin.\n - Bid Strategically on Mechanism J: Similar to Appliance O, Mechanism J is another high-priority item. Start bidding when the price is below your estimated value of $8800, but be mindful of the competition and adjust your strategy based on the bidding patterns.\n - Bid conservatively at first: Start with bids slightly above the starting price to gauge the competition's interest. This can help you understand if your estimated value is accurate or if you need to adjust your bid limit.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Contraption I:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3500\n- Bidder 2: $3500\n- Bidder 3: $3200\n- Bidder 4: $3100\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $3800\n\nRound 2:\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

This suggests that other bidders might be more aggressive or have similar estimated values. Adjust your safety margin accordingly.\n - Item Prioritization: Focus on the items with the highest potential profit margins, which are Appliance O, Mechanism J, and Utensil N, as they have estimated values of $8800 or more.

If they show interest in the same high-priority items as you, be strategic in your bidding.\n - Budget Allocation: Since you have a remaining budget of $16,200 and Appliance O is your top priority, allocate a significant portion of your budget for this item. Given its estimated value of $8,800, you can set a maximum bid limit around $7,800 to $8,000 to account for potential overestimation.\n - Assess Competition: Observe the bidding behavior of other bidders.

This will help you avoid bidding on items that might not contribute significantly to your overall profit.\n - Monitor Bidder 1's Bid Increments: If Bidder 1's bid increments are decreasing, it could indicate that they are becoming more cautious with their spending, possibly due to a limited budget.\n - Learning from Past Bids: Analyze the bidding patterns of other bidders and adjust your limits if you notice they are more or less aggressive than expected. This can help you make more informed decisions during the auction.\n - Risk Management: Since you've won three items so far, consider the risk of overextending your budget. Be more cautious with your bids on the remaining items, especially if the bidding is intense.\n - Bid Aggressively or Passively: For items with high adjusted profit margins and low competition, bid aggressively to secure them. For items with high competition or low profit margins, consider bidding passively or not at all to conserve your budget.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $2600\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 4: $10600\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Contraption I: $3800\n    * Appliance O: $4900\n    * Doodad D: $2700\n    * Element R: $6000\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

You should either withdraw (saying \"I'm out!\") or make a higher bid for this item (saying \"I bid $xxx!\")."},{"ai":"Reasons for my decision:\n\n1. **Estimated Value:** My estimated value for Implement G is $6600, which provides a good potential for profit.\n2. **Bid Strategy:** I planned to start bidding conservatively at $3,100 and gradually increase my bid, but not exceeding $4,100 to maintain a $3,000 profit margin.\n3. **Bidder 3's Behavior:** Although Bidder 3 has been aggressive in the past, I don't have any information on their current interest in Implement G.\n4. **Remaining Budget:** I have $2600 left, which is enough to bid within my planned range.\n\nFinal Decision: **I bid $3100!**\n\nThis bid aligns with my strategy to show interest while maintaining a safe margin from the starting price. It also allows room for gradual increases while staying within my budget and profit target. I'll monitor Bidder 3's actions and adjust my bidding accordingly to maximize my chances of securing a profit while minimizing the risk of overbidding."},{"human":"Your bid of $3100 failed, because you don't have insufficient budget ($2600 left): You must reconsider your bid."},{"ai":"Apologies for the oversight. Given my remaining budget of $2600, I need to adjust my bid accordingly.\n\nFinal Decision: **I bid $2600!**\n\nThis bid is at the limit of my remaining budget, ensuring I stay within my financial constraints. It's a more aggressive move, but it's necessary given the situation. If this bid is successful, it would still provide a profit of $400 ($6600 - $2600). If I'm outbid, I'll have to accept that I can't compete for this item and focus on future opportunities within my budget."},{"human":"Your bid of $2600 failed, because your bid is lower than the starting bid ($3000): You must reconsider your bid."},{"ai":"I apologize for the error. Given the starting bid of $3000, I need to bid at least this amount to be considered.\n\nFinal Decision: **I bid $3000!**\n\nThis bid matches the starting price, showing my interest in the item while respecting the minimum bid requirement. It's a conservative approach, and I'll now wait to see if Bidder 3 or any other bidder enters the competition.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Compare Your Initial Estimate with Bidder 3's Bids: Observe the items Bidder 3 has won and their winning bids. If their bids are consistently above your estimated values for those items, it might be an indicator that your estimates are conservative. In the case of Implement G, if Bidder 3's bidding behavior is similar to their previous bids, you might need to revise your estimate upward.\n - Budget Constraints: Given Bidder 3's high spending, they might have a larger budget or a higher tolerance for risk. If you believe they have a better understanding of the market, you might want to adjust your estimate to account for their bidding behavior, especially if you can afford to bid higher without exceeding your budget.\n - Set bid limits: For each remaining item, set a maximum bid based on your estimated value minus a safety margin. This margin should account for potential overestimation and competition. For example, for Contraption I, your maximum bid could be $6300 (6600 - 300).\n - Item Priority: Focus on the items with the highest estimated value and potential profit first, as they are more likely to contribute significantly to your overall profit. However, be prepared to adjust your priority if the bidding dynamics change.\n - Endgame Strategy: As the auction nears its end and your budget dwindles, focus on the remaining items with the highest potential for profit, ensuring you have enough funds to make a competitive bid.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Implement G:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $3500\n- Bidder 3: $3500\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Implement G, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Implement G. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding. Here's your previous status:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $2600\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $3500\n  * Bidder 2: $3800\n  * Bidder 3: $7500\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Apparatus H: $3500\n    * Widget A: $1200\n    * Gadget B: $1500\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * Unit Q: $6000\n    * Machine P: $7000\n    * Thingamajig C: $1500\n```\n\nSummarize the notable behaviors of all bidders in this round of bidding for future reference.
