This would result in the following adjusted values: Machine P: $9350, Thingamajig C: $1870, Gizmo F: $3740, Apparatus H: $5610","1":"Bid Ceilings: Set new bid ceilings for each item based on the adjusted values, with a small buffer (e.g., 5%) to account for potential competition: Machine P: $9833, Thingamajig C: $1967, Gizmo F: $3910, Apparatus H: $5883","2":"Bid Aggressively but Cautiously: Given your low remaining budget, you may need to bid more aggressively to outbid competitors, but be cautious not to exceed your new bid ceilings.","3":"Risk Assessment: Assess the risk of overbidding, especially since you have limited funds. Consider the likelihood of other bidders dropping out and the potential true values of the items.","4":"Budget Allocation: After winning Element R for $6500 and Implement G for $3500, you have $10,800 left. Allocate your remaining budget wisely, prioritizing high-value items with a good estimated value-to-starting price ratio.","5":"Flexibility: If the bidding on Mechanism J or other high-value items exceeds your maximum bid limit, be prepared to shift your focus to the next best item within your budget.","6":"Bid Strategy for Unit Q: Start bidding conservatively, just above the starting price, to gauge the interest of other bidders. If the bidding stays within your estimated value, gradually increase your bid, but set a maximum bid limit based on your estimated value with a buffer for potential overestimation. Be prepared to drop out if the bidding exceeds your maximum bid limit or if it becomes clear that the true value is lower than your estimate.","7":"Backup Items: If you don't win Unit Q or Machine P, prioritize bidding on Doodad D, Appliance O, Utensil N, Gizmo F, and Apparatus H, as they have relatively high estimated values compared to their starting prices.","8":"Opportunistic Bidding on Appliance O and Utensil N: If the bidding on Mechanism J, Unit Q, or Machine P becomes too competitive, consider Appliance O and Utensil N as alternatives. They also have high estimated values, but their starting prices might result in more manageable bidding wars.","9":"Estimate True Value: If the bidding for an item exceeds your estimated value, consider whether the true value might be higher than your initial assessment. If you believe the true value is lower, drop out of the bidding. If you're unsure, set a slightly higher bid ceiling to account for the uncertainty.","10":"Balance between High-Value and Low-Value Items: While focusing on high-value items, don't entirely disregard the lower-value items (Widget A, Gadget B, Thingamajig C, Gizmo F, and Apparatus H) if they become available at bargain prices. They can still contribute to your overall profit.","11":"Bid Ceilings: Set bid ceilings for each item based on your adjusted estimated values, with a buffer for potential overestimation. Be prepared to withdraw if the bidding exceeds these ceilings.","12":"Reassess Budget: After winning three items (Contraption I, Equipment E, and Mechanism J) and losing one (Implement G), Bidder 4 has a remaining budget of $200. This is significantly lower than the initial $20,000, indicating a need to be extremely cautious with future bids.","13":"Apparatus H: {'Goal': 'Prioritize this item due to its high estimated value, but be prepared to let it go if bidding exceeds the budget.', 'Guideline': 'Set a maximum bid limit of $6300, which is slightly below the estimated value of $6600.', 'Strategy': 'Start bidding conservatively and gradually increase your bid as needed, but be ready to withdraw if the bidding surpasses your limit.'}","14":"Be prepared to walk away: If bidding exceeds the maximum bid limit, Bidder 4 should not hesitate to withdraw from the auction. It's crucial to conserve the remaining budget for potential opportunities in the later rounds.","15":"Final Bids: For the remaining items, Bidder 4 should consider making their last bids on Gizmo F, Gadget B, or Widget A, as these have the lowest starting prices and might be more feasible within the current budget. If any of these items are won, the remaining budget can be used for a final attempt at Utensil N or Apparatus H, but with extreme caution.","16":"Appliance O and Machine P: Set a maximum bid limit based on your estimated value with a buffer, and be prepared to withdraw if the bidding exceeds this limit. Monitor the bidding behavior of Bidder 3, who has shown a willingness to bid aggressively on high-value items.","17":"Doodad D and Gizmo F: Bid conservatively, and if the bidding stays within your estimated value range, consider participating. However, if the bidding escalates, prioritize preserving your budget for higher-potential items.","18":"Utensil N and Gadget B: Keep an eye on the bidding, and if the starting bids are low and the competition seems weak, consider bidding to potentially secure a profit.","19":"Widget A and Thingamajig C: Only bid on these items if the bidding is unusually low, indicating a potential opportunity for a good deal. Otherwise, focus on the higher-potential items.","20":"Bid Strategy for Gizmo F: With a starting price of $2000 and an estimated value of $4400, you can afford to be more competitive, but still, set a maximum bid limit based on your estimated value with a buffer for potential overestimation. Be prepared to bid up to your limit if necessary, but be aware that you may not have enough funds for other items if you win Gizmo F.","21":"Patience: Be patient and wait for other bidders to engage first. This will help gauge the competition's interest and potentially allow for a more strategic bid.","22":"Budget Allocation: With only $200 remaining, be cautious with bids and prioritize items with a higher estimated value-to-starting price ratio, like Apparatus H.","23":"Risk Assessment: Bidding on Apparatus H is risky due to the low remaining budget, but it could be an opportunity if other bidders are not interested or have exceeded their budget.","24":"Adaptability: If you miss out on Apparatus H, be prepared to adjust your strategy for the remaining items. Focus on items with lower starting prices that might have a higher true value if other bidders drop out early.","25":"Patience: Avoid the temptation to overbid, even if it means missing out on a potentially profitable item. Maximize overall profit, not just win a single item.","26":"Endgame Focus: Focus on the last two items (Gadget B and Gizmo F) with the highest potential for profit. If both items are lost, it might be best to conserve the remaining budget for potential future opportunities or to avoid further losses.","27":"Competitive Analysis: Observe the bidding behavior of the remaining bidders. If they seem to be bidding more aggressively, adjust your strategy accordingly, potentially bidding closer to your estimated value to stay competitive.","28":"Monitor competitor behavior to anticipate their bidding strategies: Be cautious with high-value items, setting stricter bid limits.","29":"Apparatus H Observation: Although you can't bid on Apparatus H, monitor the bidding to learn from the process and gather information for future auctions or to adjust your bidding strategy for Gizmo F if necessary.","30":"Competitor Analysis: Observe the bidding behavior of Bidder 1, Bidder 2, and Bidder 3, especially on Gizmo F. If they have already won high-value items, they might be more cautious with their remaining budget, which could work in your favor.","31":"Endgame Focus: As this is one of the last items you can bid on, focus all your attention and resources on Gizmo F. If you lose this item, your auction participation will effectively end.","32":"Bid Increment Strategy: Since you have a small budget, bid in small increments to avoid overbidding. This might encourage other bidders to drop out if they perceive the item as not worth the increasing price.","33":"Bid Only on High-Value-to-Budget Ratio Items: Focus on items where the potential profit margin is higher compared to the remaining budget. Gizmo F seems to be a better option in this regard, given its lower starting price.","34":"Final Item Focus: Since you have only one item left to bid on (Apparatus H), prioritize it. Given its starting price and your estimated value, it could be a good opportunity if you can secure it at a reasonable price. However, be prepared to walk away if the bidding exceeds your revised estimate.","35":"Learning from Past Bids: Analyze the bidding patterns of other bidders. Notice that Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 have similar total profits, and Bidder 3 has the highest. This suggests that they might be using similar strategies or have similar estimated values. Be mindful of their potential bids on Apparatus H.","36":"Post-Auction Evaluation: After the auction, evaluate your performance and learn from your decisions. Identify areas where you could have managed your budget better or where you might have overestimated or underestimated item values. This will help you improve your strategy in future auctions.","37":"Endgame Strategy: Focus entirely on Thingamajig C and Gizmo F. If you don't win either, consider bidding on Apparatus H, but be very conservative, as it has a higher starting price and you'll have limited funds left.","38":"Patience: Exercise patience and stick to pre-determined bid limits. Be prepared to walk away if necessary.","39":"Learning from Others: Observe the bidding behavior of Bidder 1 and Bidder 2, who have been more active and successful. If they show interest in the remaining items, it might indicate a higher true value, and you should be more cautious with your bidding.","40":"Risk-averse Approach: Given the low budget, adopt a more risk-averse strategy. Avoid bidding on items where there's a high chance of overestimating their true value, as this could lead to further losses.","41":"Budget Management: With only $200 left, you must be extremely cautious with your bids. Focus on items with a high potential for profit while ensuring you don't exceed your budget.","42":"Bid Cancellation: If the bidding for Gizmo F or Apparatus H exceeds your estimated value or remaining budget, be prepared to withdraw your bid to avoid potential losses.","43":"Budget Constraint: The primary constraint is the remaining budget of $200, which is insufficient to bid on Gizmo F or Apparatus H at their starting prices. Therefore, any bidding on these items must be highly strategic and based on very low increments.","44":"Apparatus H: Given the starting price, it's highly unlikely that Bidder 4 can participate in the bidding for Apparatus H. Therefore, this item should not be a priority.","45":"Bidder 1: Has a consistent pattern of bidding slightly above the starting price and then withdrawing when outbid. This suggests a conservative approach or a focus on specific items. Their estimated values for Contraption I, Widget A, and Thingamajig C seem to be accurate, but they might have a lower budget or a stricter bidding strategy.","46":"Bidder 2: Also appears to be conservative, bidding close to the starting price and not engaging in bidding wars. Their estimated value for Utensil N seems accurate, indicating a focus on items with lower starting prices but potentially high true values.","47":"Bid Only to Win: Given the limited funds, Bidder 4 should only bid on items they believe they can win at a price that will result in a profit. Avoid getting into bidding wars with other bidders.","48":"Anticipate True Values: If possible, try to infer the true values of the remaining items based on the bidding patterns and the winning bids of other items. This can help you make more informed decisions about bidding.","49":"Bid Strategy for Widget A: As planned, set a maximum bid of $1800 for Widget A. This allows for a $1200 profit while accounting for potential overestimation. Monitor the bidding closely, and if it exceeds $1800, withdraw.","50":"Opportunistic Bidding: Since the remaining items have higher starting prices, Bidder 4 should only bid if there's a chance to secure a profit with a low bid. For example, if Machine P's bidding stays low, consider bidding up to $5000, but this is a high-risk move given the limited budget.","51":"Patience and Discipline: Maintain discipline and avoid getting caught up in bidding wars. Stick to your maximum bid limits and be prepared to let go of items if they exceed your budget or estimated value.","52":"Bid Strategy: For Gadget B, Bidder 4 has set a maximum bid of $1800 to maintain a profit margin. This is a good strategy, as it allows for a $400 profit if the true value is $2200. However, if the bidding exceeds $1800, it's best to withdraw to avoid potential losses.","53":"Patience: Given the limited budget, Bidder 4 should be patient and wait for the right opportunities to bid. Don't get caught up in bidding wars, especially with higher-priced items like Machine P.","54":"Bidder 3 Analysis: Bidder 3 has been more aggressive, bidding on higher-priced items like Implement G and Machine P. It's less likely that Bidder 3 will compete for the lower-priced items, but still worth keeping an eye on their behavior.","55":"Machine P: With a starting price of $5000 and an estimated value of $11000, this item is another high priority. However, you won't be able to bid on it due to your limited budget.","56":"Bid Strategy for Thingamajig C: As you've mentioned, set a maximum bid of $1800 for Thingamajig C to ensure a profit. Monitor the bidding closely, and if the price exceeds $1800, withdraw from the bidding.","57":"Machine P and Gizmo F: Given their higher starting prices, it's unlikely you'll be able to bid on these items with your remaining budget. However, if the bidding is unexpectedly low, you might consider bidding, but only if you believe there's a significant chance of securing a profit.","58":"Apparatus H: With a starting price of $3000, it's out of your budget range. However, if you win both Thingamajig C and Gadget B, and the bidding on Apparatus H remains low, you might consider using your remaining budget as a last-ditch effort for a potential profit.","59":"Apparatus H: Starting at $3000 and with an estimated value of $6600, Apparatus H is another potentially profitable item. Set a maximum bid of $5600 to maintain a $1000 profit margin. Be prepared to withdraw if the bidding exceeds this limit.","60":"Set maximum bid limits: Use the suggested maximum bids to ensure a profit while accounting for potential overestimation.","61":"Budget Allocation: Allocate your remaining $2,000 budget to the prioritized items (Machine P, Gizmo F, and Apparatus H) in descending order of their estimated value-to-starting price ratios.","62":"Bid Strategy for Machine P: Since it has the highest estimated value, start bidding conservatively, but be prepared to increase your bid if necessary. Set a maximum bid limit based on your estimated value with a buffer to account for potential overestimation.","63":"Bid Strategy for Apparatus H: If you don't win the first two items, bid on Apparatus H. Given its starting price, it could still offer a good profit margin if the bidding stays within reason.","64":"Avoid Bidding Wars: Be cautious of items that might trigger bidding wars, especially if they have low starting prices. This could lead to overbidding and depleting your funds quickly.","65":"Monitor Other Bidders: Keep track of the bidding patterns and remaining budgets of other bidders. If a bidder with a high budget drops out, it might be a good opportunity to bid more aggressively on items you value.","66":"Avoid Overconfidence: Even if you have won items with good profit margins, don't become overconfident. Each item is a new opportunity, and maintaining discipline is crucial for overall success.","67":"Bidder 1's Bid Thresholds: Note Bidder 1's withdrawal at $3500 for Contraption I and non-participation in the bidding for Equipment E or Element R. Keep an eye on their bid increments and withdrawal patterns.","68":"Risk Tolerance: Assess risk tolerance. If willing to take on more risk, consider bidding slightly above the estimated value for high-value items, hoping that the true value is higher than the estimate.","69":"Assessing Competition: Observe the bidding patterns of other bidders. If they seem to be running low on funds or have already won high-value items, you might have a better chance of winning items at lower prices.","70":"Bid Early, Drop Out Early: If the bidding on a high-priority item exceeds your bid ceiling, be prepared to drop out early. This will conserve your budget for other items with better bidding prospects.","71":"Final Bid: For the last item, consider using your remaining budget as a last-ditch effort to secure a profit, especially if it's an item with a high estimated value relative to its starting price.","72":"Risk Assessment: Since you have already won three items, consider the risk of overexposure. Focus on diversifying your bids across different items to minimize the impact of a single loss.","73":"Cash Reserves: Maintain a cash reserve for the endgame. As the auction progresses, you may want to have enough funds to bid on the last few items with high potential profits.","74":"Estimate Margin: Since you have a very small budget, bid only on items where your estimated value is significantly higher than the starting price. For example, consider bidding on Thingamajig C, as its starting price is $1000 and your estimated value is $2200, which provides a good profit margin.","75":"Bid Only When Confident: Given your low budget, bid only when you are confident that the item's true value is likely to be close to or higher than your estimated value. This will minimize the risk of losing money.","76":"Bid Withdrawal: If the bidding exceeds your estimated value or Bidder 1 shows no interest, be prepared to withdraw from the auction to conserve your budget for other items.","77":"Bidder 1's Aggressiveness: Consider Bidder 1's willingness to bid up to $3500 for Contraption I and assess if they become more aggressive for high-value items or better profit.","78":"Bidder 1's Remaining Budget: Infer that Bidder 1 has a remaining budget of at least $16,500 ($20,000 - $3,500) to gauge their potential to outbid you on higher-priced items.","79":"Bidder 1's Withdrawal Patterns: Utilize Bidder 1's withdrawal patterns to your advantage by bidding just enough to outbid them in the second round, potentially avoiding a bidding war.","80":"High-Value Targets: Focus on Appliance O, Utensil N, and Machine P, as they have the highest estimated values. Bid conservatively on these items, but be prepared to bid more aggressively if the bidding stays below your estimated value.","81":"Priority List: Rank the remaining items by their estimated value-to-starting price ratio, with a focus on items that can still provide a decent profit margin despite your reduced budget. In this case, the priority list might be: Appliance O, Utensil N, Gizmo F, Widget A, Gadget B, Thingamajig C, Apparatus H.","82":"Risk Management: Given your low budget, prioritize items with a lower risk of overestimation. This might mean focusing on items with lower starting prices, like Widget A, Gadget B, Thingamajig C, Gizmo F, and Apparatus H.","83":"Acceptance: Recognize that you may not win any more items due to your limited budget. The key is to maintain discipline and not get emotionally invested in winning, as the ultimate goal is to maximize overall profit.","84":"Profit Margin Maintenance: Aim to maintain a healthy profit margin by not overbidding on any item. This will ensure that your overall profit remains high, even if you don't win all the high-value items.","85":"Budget Reallocation: With a remaining budget of only $200, it's crucial to reassess your priorities. Focus on the items with the highest potential for profit, given your estimated values and the remaining budget.","86":"Bid Timing: Observe the bidding patterns of Bidder 1 and Bidder 3. If they tend to bid early, wait for their bids to gauge their interest and adjust your bid accordingly. If they tend to bid late, be prepared to bid quickly to secure the item before they can.","87":"Anticipate Other Bidders' Budget Constraints: Consider that Bidder 1 and Bidder 3 have also spent a significant portion of their budgets. They may become more cautious or run out of funds, which could work in your favor for later items.","88":"Budget Assessment: You have a remaining budget of $200, which is quite limited. Given the high-value items you've identified (Unit Q, Machine P, Appliance O, and Utensil N), you'll need to be extremely cautious with your bidding.","89":"Opportunistic Bidding on Mid-Value Items: If high-value items become too competitive, consider bidding on Doodad D, Gizmo F, and Apparatus H, which have mid-range estimated values. These can still provide good profits if won at a reasonable price.","90":"Endgame Flexibility: As the auction progresses, adjust your strategy based on the remaining items and your budget. If you secure a high-value item early, you can be more aggressive on the remaining items with lower estimated values.","91":"Learning from Past Bids: Analyze the bidding patterns of the other bidders and adjust your strategy accordingly. If they tend to drop out quickly, you might be able to secure items at lower bids than expected.","92":"Conserving Funds: With high-value items still in play, conserve your budget for those items. Avoid bidding on items that could potentially deplete your funds before you can bid on higher-value ones.","93":"Profit Margin Calculation: Calculate the potential profit margin for each item before bidding. If the margin is too low, it might be better to let the item go to another bidder.","94":"Set conservative bid limits: For each item, set a maximum bid limit that is slightly below your estimated value to account for potential overestimation. For example, for Equipment E, set a limit of $4300; for Element R, set a limit of $10,500, and so on.","95":"Monitor Bidder 1's behavior: Since Bidder 1 has already made a profit, they might be more aggressive in the auction. Keep an eye on their bids and adjust your strategy accordingly.","96":"Item Order of Priority: Rank the high-value items based on your estimated value-to-starting price ratio and your perceived competition from other bidders. For example, if you think Element R and Unit Q have the highest potential for profit and less competition, prioritize them first.","97":"Budget Allocation: Allocate your remaining budget ($17,300) across the high-value items, ensuring you have enough funds for the most promising ones. If you win an item, adjust your budget and bidding strategy accordingly.","98":"Bid below estimated value: Start your bids slightly below your estimated value for each item, leaving room for increments. For example, if the estimated value is $8800, start at $7800 or $7900.","99":"Monitor other bidders: Observe the bidding patterns of other bidders to understand their thresholds and adjust your increments accordingly. If they seem to be bidding conservatively, you can be more aggressive with your increments.","100":"Bid selectively: Avoid bidding on items with low estimated value-to-starting price ratios, like Widget A, Gadget B, Thingamajig C, and Gizmo F, unless the bidding stays low and there's a chance for a profit.","101":"Consider the remaining budget: With a total budget of $20,000 and no winnings yet, you have ample funds to bid on high-value items. However, ensure you have enough for the later items that might have higher potential profits.","102":"Anticipate competition: If multiple items have similar estimated values, be prepared for bidding wars. Analyze the competition's behavior and adjust your strategy to outbid them without exceeding your bid limits.","103":"Manage risk: If an item's bidding exceeds your maximum bid limit, be prepared to withdraw and focus on the next item. Don't let the desire to win push you to overbid.","104":"Reserve Threshold: Given your current remaining budget of $17,300, you should aim to maintain a reserve of at least $5,000 to $7,000. This would leave you with a range of $12,300 to $14,300 for bidding on the remaining items.","105":"Item Prioritization: Focus on the items with the highest estimated values relative to their starting prices. In your case, these are: Element R ($11,000 est. value, $5,000 start price), Implement G ($6,600 est. value, $3,000 start price), Mechanism J ($8,800 est. value, $4,000 start price), Unit Q ($11,000 est. value, $5,000 start price), Appliance O ($8,800 est. value, $4,000 start price), Machine P ($11,000 est. value, $5,000 start price)","106":"Bid Strategy: For the high-priority items, bid conservatively to avoid overpaying. Start with a bid slightly above the starting price, and increase your bid incrementally, but not exceeding your estimated value minus a buffer for potential overestimation.","107":"Risk Assessment: Since you've already won Equipment E with a profit of $1,400, consider the risk of overestimating the remaining items. Be more cautious with items that have a higher risk of overestimation.","108":"Estimate Adjustments: Review the bidding patterns of other bidders and adjust your estimated value buffer accordingly, considering their behavior.","109":"Patience: Wait for the right moment to bid, and if the bidding exceeds your adjusted estimated value, be prepared to withdraw and conserve your budget for other opportunities.","110":"Bid conservatively on items with similar values: For items like Equipment E, Doodad D, Gizmo F, and Apparatus H, which have estimated values close to $4,400 and $6,600, bid conservatively, as they may not offer as much profit potential as the higher-value items. Bid just enough to outbid others without overpaying.","111":"Bid Increment Awareness: Understand the bid increments to avoid overbidding unnecessarily. Be aware of the minimum amount you need to bid to outbid competitors without overshooting your estimated value.","112":"Bidder 2 and 3's Behavior: They might be more competitive on items with lower starting prices or higher estimated values relative to their budgets.","113":"Estimating Other Bidders' Budgets: This information can help you gauge their potential bidding power for the remaining items.","114":"Buffer for Overestimation: Since you've already won an item (Equipment E) with a profit of $1100, consider a conservative buffer for potential overestimation. A 10-20% buffer could be appropriate, depending on your risk tolerance.","115":"Priority List: Rank the remaining items by their estimated value-to-starting price ratio, considering the buffer. This will help you prioritize which items to bid more aggressively on.","116":"Bid Thresholds: {'Element R': '$9,900 (90% of $11,000, considering a 10% buffer)', 'Implement G': '$5,940 (90% of $6,600)', 'Mechanism J': '$7,920 (90% of $8,800)', 'Unit Q': '$9,900 (90% of $11,000)', 'Doodad D': '$3,960 (90% of $4,400)', 'Appliance O': '$7,920 (90% of $8,800)', 'Utensil N': '$7,920 (90% of $8,800)', 'Widget A': '$1,980 (90% of $2,200)', 'Gadget B': '$1,980 (90% of $2,200)', 'Machine P': '$9,900 (90% of $11,000)', 'Thingamajig C': '$1,980 (90% of $2,200)', 'Gizmo F': '$3,960 (90% of $4,400)', 'Apparatus H': '$5,940 (90% of $6,600)'}","117":"Bid Aggressively on High-Value Items: Focus on bidding more aggressively on items with higher estimated values (e.g., Element R, Unit Q, Mechanism J, and Machine P) if they are within your budget and bid thresholds.","118":"Budget Management: After winning Equipment E, you have $17,300 left. Make sure to allocate your remaining budget wisely, considering the bid thresholds and the potential for future bidding wars.","119":"Timing: Be strategic about when to bid. If you think other bidders might be more interested in an item, wait for them to bid first, then bid just enough to outbid them without exceeding your threshold.","120":"Budget Management: After losing Contraption I, you still have a full budget of $20,000. Allocate your funds wisely, prioritizing the high-value items while ensuring you have enough for later rounds.","121":"Learn from Past Mistakes: Reflect on why you withdrew from the bidding for Contraption I. If it was due to overestimation, adjust your bidding strategy for similar items in the future. If it was because of a bidding war, be more disciplined in your bidding to avoid repeating the same scenario.","122":"Opportunistic Bidding: Be prepared to bid on items with lower starting prices that could potentially have high true values if other bidders drop out early, allowing you to secure a good profit.","123":"Avoid Early Bidding Wars: Let other bidders reveal their interest and estimated values first. This can help you gauge the competition and make more informed decisions.","124":"Evaluate Risk: For items with lower estimated values, weigh the risk of overestimation against the potential profit. Be more selective with these items, especially if they have similar starting prices.","125":"Track Budget: Keep a close eye on your remaining budget and adjust your bidding strategy as the auction progresses. Ensure you have enough funds for the high-priority items.","126":"Item Selection: Prioritize bidding on items with the highest estimated value-to-starting price ratios, as these are more likely to result in higher profits.","127":"Flexibility: Be adaptable to changing circumstances during the auction. If an item's bidding exceeds your estimated value, be prepared to abandon that item and focus on the next one.","128":"Endgame Strategy: As the auction nears its end and your remaining budget dwindles, focus on the remaining items with the highest potential for profit, ensuring you don't exhaust your funds too early."}},"arms_cnt":{"Bidder 1":[],"Bidder 2":[],"Bidder 3":[],"Bidder 4":[1,10,26,39,51,64,70,72,79,88,93,106,112,116,121,129]},"model_info":{"Bidder 1":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 2":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 3":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 4":"qwen-72b"}}
