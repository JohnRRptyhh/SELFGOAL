Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Bid Strategy Development: Develop a bidding strategy that allows you to bid conservatively, ensuring that you don't overpay for any item. This could involve setting a maximum bid limit for each item based on your estimated value, with a buffer to account for potential overestimation.\n - Budget Management: Allocate your budget wisely, considering the potential value of each item and the likelihood of competition. Prioritize items with higher estimated values and lower starting prices to maximize your potential profit.\n - Item Valuation Accuracy: Improve the accuracy of your item valuations by researching market trends, past auction results, or any available information on the items. This will help minimize the risk of overestimating or underestimating the true value.\n - Risk Assessment: Assess the risk of losing a high-value item due to intense competition. If the risk is high, you may need to adjust your bidding strategy for that item or be prepared to accept a lower profit margin.\n - Patience and Discipline: Exercise patience and discipline, avoiding the temptation to get caught up in bidding wars that could exceed your estimated values or deplete your budget.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"As Bidder 4, you have a total budget of $20000.

A 10% buffer might not be enough, so consider increasing it to 15% or 20% to account for potential overestimation and competition.\n - Budget Allocation: Allocate a larger portion of your remaining budget to the high-priority items. For example, you might set a maximum bid limit for each of these items that is closer to their estimated values, but still below to ensure a profit.\n - Monitor Bid Increments: Keep an eye on the bid increments to avoid overbidding. If the increments are small, you can bid slightly above the current bid to discourage others from bidding further.\n - Buffer for Overestimation: Given that you overestimated the value of Equipment E, consider applying a smaller buffer or a more conservative bidding approach for the remaining items to account for potential overestimation.\n - Monitor Bidder 3's Behavior: Keep a close eye on Bidder 3's bidding strategy and adjust your bidding accordingly to minimize direct competition.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Implement G:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3200\n- Bidder 2: $3200\n- Bidder 3: $3200\n- Bidder 4: $3100\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $3500\n\nRound 2:\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

For example: Machine P: $10,500 (leaving a $500 buffer), Unit Q: $10,500 (leaving a $500 buffer), Appliance O: $8,500 (leaving a $300 buffer), Element R: $10,500 (leaving a $500 buffer)\n - Bid Conservation for Middle-Value Items: For Appliance O, Mechanism J, Utensil N, and Contraption I, bid conservatively, as their estimated values are lower. Bid just enough to outbid competitors while staying within a reasonable distance from your estimated value.\n - Bid Strategically on Lower-Value Items: For Gizmo F, Implement G, Appliance O, and other lower-value items, bid conservatively to avoid bidding wars.

The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Budget Allocation: Since you've spent $6200 and have $7300 left, allocate your budget more conservatively. Focus on the high-value items with estimated values above $6000 (Appliance O, Unit Q, and Element R), as they offer the greatest potential for profit.\n - Buffer Percentage: Aim for a higher buffer percentage (difference between your bid and estimated value) for the high-value items. For example, if the starting bid for Unit Q is $5000 and your estimated value is $11000, you might bid around $7000 to maintain a buffer of at least 40%.\n - Budget Allocation: Since you've spent $12700 on Equipment E, Implement G, and Machine P, you have $7300 left. Allocate this budget wisely, prioritizing high-priority items. For instance, you might set a maximum bid limit for each high-priority item that is slightly below your estimated value but still within your remaining budget.\n - Bid Conservation: For non-high-priority items with lower estimated values, bid conservatively to avoid overpaying. Use these items to potentially increase your profit margin if the high-priority items become too competitive.\n - Bid Withdrawal: If the bidding exceeds your maximum bid limit or if the item's price surpasses its estimated value, be prepared to withdraw from the bidding to conserve your budget for more promising opportunities.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $7300\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $1500\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * Gizmo F: $2500\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Equipment E: $2700\n    * Implement G: $3500\n    * Machine P: $6500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Allocate this budget wisely, prioritizing high-priority items. For instance, you might set a maximum bid limit for each high-priority item that is slightly below your estimated value but still within your remaining budget.\n - High-Priority Items (Maximize Profit): {'Appliance O': \"Given its high estimated value, bid aggressively but conservatively, ensuring you don't exceed your estimated value by a significant margin. Start with a bid just above the last bidder's, if any, and gradually increase as needed.\", 'Utensil N': 'Similar to Appliance O, bid aggressively but within your estimated value to secure a high-profit item.', 'Element R': 'Given its high estimated value, prioritize this item, but be cautious of Bidder 1, who has shown a willingness to bid up to $10,000. Monitor their bidding behavior and adjust your strategy accordingly.'}\n - Mid-Priority Items (Balanced Approach): {'Apparatus H': 'Bid conservatively, as its estimated value is lower than your remaining budget. Start with a bid just above the starting price and increase gradually, but be prepared to withdraw if the bidding becomes too competitive.', 'Contraption I': 'Similar to Apparatus H, bid conservatively, but monitor the bidding patterns to potentially increase your bid if the item seems undervalued by other bidders.'}\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $7300\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $4000\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $1500\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Unit Q: $6000\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * Gizmo F: $2500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Conservative Bidding: Given that you've spent $6200 and have $7300 left, bid conservatively to avoid overextending your budget. Focus on bidding within a range that allows for a reasonable profit margin while ensuring you don't exceed your estimated values.\n - Bid Limits for High-Value Items: {'Implement G': '$5610 (85% of $6600)', 'Machine P': '$9350 (85% of $11000)', 'Unit Q': '$9350 (85% of $11000)', 'Appliance O': '$7480 (85% of $8800)', 'Element R': '$9350 (85% of $11000)'}\n - Budget Allocation: Since you've spent $12700 on Equipment E, Implement G, and Machine P, you have $7300 left. Allocate this budget wisely, prioritizing high-priority items. For instance, you might set a maximum bid limit for each high-priority item that is slightly below your estimated value but still within your remaining budget.\n - High-Priority Items (Maximize Profit): {'Appliance O': \"Given its high estimated value, bid aggressively but conservatively, ensuring you don't exceed your estimated value by a significant margin. Start with a bid just above the last bidder's, if any, and gradually increase as needed.\", 'Utensil N': 'Similar to Appliance O, bid aggressively but within your estimated value to secure a high-profit item.', 'Element R': 'Given its high estimated value, prioritize this item, but be cautious of Bidder 1, who has shown a willingness to bid up to $10,000. Monitor their bidding behavior and adjust your strategy accordingly.'}\n - Mid-Priority Items (Balanced Approach): {'Apparatus H': 'Bid conservatively, as its estimated value is lower than your remaining budget. Start with a bid just above the starting price and increase gradually, but be prepared to withdraw if the bidding becomes too competitive.', 'Contraption I': 'Similar to Apparatus H, bid conservatively, but monitor the bidding patterns to potentially increase your bid if the item seems undervalued by other bidders.'}\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Appliance O:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $4200\n- Bidder 2: $4500\n- Bidder 3: $4500\n- Bidder 4: $4100\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $4900\n\nRound 2:\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

For Gizmo F, for example, set a maximum bid limit of $4200 (estimated value - $200 buffer) to ensure a profit if you win.\n - Budget allocation: Since you've spent $6700 so far, you have $13300 left. Allocate this budget wisely, prioritizing high-value items with a good buffer percentage while ensuring you don't overspend.\n - Track Other Bidders: Monitor the behavior and spending patterns of other bidders, especially Bidder 1, who has a high-profit margin. Their actions may indicate their remaining budget and bidding strategy, which can inform your own decisions.\n - Maximize High-Value Opportunities: Focus on the items with the highest estimated values, such as Apparatus H, Utensil N, and Element R. These have the potential to bring in the most profit if won at the right price.\n - Element R: Start bidding conservatively just above the starting price.

Showing your interest by bidding with or slightly above the starting price of this item, then gradually increase your bid.\n2. Think step by step of the pros and cons and the consequences of your action (e.g., remaining budget in future bidding) in order to achieve your primary objective.\n3.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Item Priority: Prioritize Contraption I and Element R, as they have the highest estimated values. If you can secure these at a reasonable price, they will have the greatest potential to increase your profit.\n - Anticipate\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u884c\u4e3a: Try to predict the behavior of other bidders. If Bidder 1 seems to be targeting high-value items, they might be a strong competitor for Element R. Adjust your bidding strategy accordingly.\n - Gadget B: Set a maximum bid limit of $2000 (estimated value - $200 buffer) to maintain a profit margin. Given its low starting price, it could be a good opportunity to secure a profit without overextending your budget.\n - Bid Early, Bid Often: In a bid to diversify, consider placing bids early on Doodad D to signal your interest and potentially discourage other bidders with lower budgets or lower interest in the item.\n - Avoid Overbidding: Remember that diversifying bids doesn't mean overbidding. Stick to your budget and valuation estimates to ensure you maintain a healthy profit margin across multiple items.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Doodad D:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $2500\n- Bidder 2: $2500\n- Bidder 3: $2500\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Doodad D, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Doodad D. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.
