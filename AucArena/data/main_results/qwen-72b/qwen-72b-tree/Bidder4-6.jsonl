This involves prioritizing items with higher estimated values and ensuring you have enough funds for later items that might have higher potential profits.\n - Competitive Analysis: Observe the bidding behavior of other bidders to gauge their interest and estimated values for the items. This can help you make more informed decisions about when to bid and when to drop out.\n - Risk Assessment: Assess the risk of overestimating or underestimating the true value of each item. For items with a higher risk of overestimation, bid more cautiously, and for those with a lower risk, be more aggressive.\n - Patience and Discipline: Exercise patience and discipline, avoiding the temptation to bid emotionally or get caught up in bidding wars. Stick to your pre-determined strategy and bid limits.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"As Bidder 4, you have a total budget of $20000.

You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Risk Management: Given the low budget, Bidder 4 should be prepared to walk away from items if bidding exceeds the estimated value minus a safety margin. It's crucial not to get caught up in bidding wars, as this could lead to a loss.\n - Priority List: Given your remaining budget, prioritize bidding on Thingamajig C (starting at $1000) and Gizmo F (starting at $2000) as they have lower starting prices and higher estimated values relative to their starting prices.\n - Risk Assessment: Gadget B has a lower starting price and a higher estimated value-to-remaining-budget ratio. However, it also has a lower estimated value compared to Thingamajig C. Weigh the risk of overestimating Gadget B's true value against the potential for a higher profit with Thingamajig C.\n - Competitor Analysis: Observe the bidding behavior of Bidder 1 and Bidder 2, who have shown interest in lower-priced items. If they continue to bid on similar items, it might be challenging to win Gadget B or Thingamajig C.\n - Conservative Bidding: Given your remaining budget of $200, you must be extremely cautious with your bids. Focus on items with a higher estimated value-to-starting price ratio, but only bid up to a point where you can still make a significant profit.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $200\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $3300\n  * Bidder 2: $3800\n  * Bidder 3: $2500\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Contraption I: $3500\n    * Widget A: $1200\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Utensil N: $4200\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * Implement G: $3500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Set a stricter bidding threshold: Given the low remaining budget of $200, Bidder 4 should be even more cautious with their bids.

Monitor the bidding, but it's unlikely you'll be able to participate.\n - Target Low-Starting Price Items: Gadget B and Thingamajig C, both with a starting price of $1000, are the most attractive options due to their low entry points and potential for profit.\n - Bid on Thingamajig C if Gadget B fails: If Gadget B is won by another bidder, Bidder 4 should then consider bidding on Thingamajig C, but with a more cautious approach due to the higher risk of overestimation. Start with a bid just above the starting price and increase in small increments.\n - Gizmo F and Apparatus H: Given the remaining budget, it's unlikely that Bidder 4 can bid on Gizmo F or Apparatus H, as their starting prices are beyond the current budget.

For example, for Thingamajig C, the maximum bid could be $1900; for Gizmo F, it could be $4200; and for Apparatus H, it could be $6300.\n - Utensil N: With a starting price of $4000 and an estimated value of $8800, this item is a high priority. However, given your current budget of $200, you won't be able to bid on it. Monitor the bidding, but it's unlikely you'll be able to participate.\n - Target Low-Starting Price Items: Gadget B and Thingamajig C, both with a starting price of $1000, are the most attractive options due to their low entry points and potential for profit.\n - Bid on Thingamajig C if Gadget B fails: If Gadget B is won by another bidder, Bidder 4 should then consider bidding on Thingamajig C, but with a more cautious approach due to the higher risk of overestimation. Start with a bid just above the starting price and increase in small increments.\n - Gizmo F and Apparatus H: Given the remaining budget, it's unlikely that Bidder 4 can bid on Gizmo F or Apparatus H, as their starting prices are beyond the current budget. However, if there's an opportunity to bid on Gizmo F with a very low increment, it could be worth considering due to its estimated value of $4400.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Thingamajig C:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $1500\n- Bidder 2: $1100\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

However, this is a high-risk move, as it could lead to overextending the budget.\n - Estimate Adjustments for Gadget B: Gadget B was won by Bidder 1 at $1100, which is below your estimated value of $2200. However, since the bidding stopped at $1100, it's possible that the true value was lower than your estimate. If you believe the true value is closer to the winning bid, you might want to revise your estimate downward for Gadget B.\n - Risk Assessment: Assess the risk of overbidding, be prepared to walk away if the bidding exceeds your estimated value, especially for Gizmo F, as you won't have much room for error.\n - Observation and Analysis: Continue to monitor the bidding behavior of other bidders to understand their strategies and potential estimated values for the remaining items.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Bid Aggressively but Cautiously: Given your low remaining budget, you may need to bid more aggressively to outbid competitors, but be cautious not to exceed your new bid ceilings.\n - Apparatus H: {'Goal': 'Prioritize this item due to its high estimated value, but be prepared to let it go if bidding exceeds the budget.', 'Guideline': 'Set a maximum bid limit of $6300, which is slightly below the estimated value of $6600.', 'Strategy': 'Start bidding conservatively and gradually increase your bid as needed, but be ready to withdraw if the bidding surpasses your limit.'}\n - Utensil N and Gadget B: Keep an eye on the bidding, and if the starting bids are low and the competition seems weak, consider bidding to potentially secure a profit.\n - Budget Allocation: With only $200 remaining, be cautious with bids and prioritize items with a higher estimated value-to-starting price ratio, like Apparatus H.\n - Bid Increment Strategy: Since you have a small budget, bid in small increments to avoid overbidding. This might encourage other bidders to drop out if they perceive the item as not worth the increasing price.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Apparatus H:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3200\n- Bidder 2: $3500\n- Bidder 3: $3500\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Apparatus H, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Apparatus H. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.
