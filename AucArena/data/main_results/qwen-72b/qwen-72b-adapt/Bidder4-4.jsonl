This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid.

The new information shows that Bidder 3 has won Element R for $6000, which means they have a strong interest in high-value items and a significant budget remaining ($5800). This changes the dynamics of the auction.\n\nGiven the new information, we need to adjust the priorities:\n\n- Unit Q and Machine P, with a starting price of $5000, are now less attractive due to Bidder 3's recent high bid on Element R. They might be willing to bid aggressively on these as well.\n- Implement G, with a starting price of $3000, is still a good opportunity, but Bidder 3 might also be interested.\n- Utensil N, with a starting price of $4000, is still a potential high-profit item if the bidding stays within reason.\n- Thingamajig C and Gadget B, with a starting price of $1000, are less important but could still provide a profit if the bidding doesn't escalate.\n\nUpdated priorities (JSON format):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Utensil N\": 3,\n  \"Implement G\": 2,\n  \"Gadget B\": 1,\n  \"Thingamajig C\": 1\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- Utensil N (priority 3) is now the top priority due to its high estimated value and a lower starting price. However, be cautious as Bidder 3 might also be interested.\n- Implement G (priority 2) is still a good opportunity, but bid conservatively, as Bidder 3 might also bid on it.\n- Items with priority 1 (Gadget B, Thingamajig C) are less important and can be sacrificed to save your budget for higher priority items. Be even more cautious with these, as they might not provide a significant profit margin given the competition and your limited budget.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget."},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Machine P:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $6000\n- Bidder 2: $5500\n- Bidder 3: $6000\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3: $6500\n\nRound 2:\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
