Start by bidding conservatively on items with high estimated value to true value ratios (items that you believe are undervalued). This will help you secure a good profit margin while not exhausting your budget early.\n2. Avoid bidding wars on items with similar estimated values, as this could lead to overpaying. Instead, focus on items where you have a significant advantage in your estimation.\n3. Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other bidders. If an item is getting too much attention, consider dropping out to save your budget for more promising items.\n4. Prioritize items with higher estimated values, especially if they have lower starting prices, as they offer a better potential for profit.\n5.

Anyone interested in this item?\"\n\n---\n\nAs Bidder 4, you have to decide whether to bid on this item or withdraw and explain why, according to your plan. Remember, Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some common practices of bidding:\n1. Showing your interest by bidding with or slightly above the starting price of this item, then gradually increase your bid.\n2. Think step by step of the pros and cons and the consequences of your action (e.g., remaining budget in future bidding) in order to achieve your primary objective.\n\n\nGive your reasons first, then make your final decision clearly. You should either withdraw (saying \"I'm out!\") or make a higher bid for this item (saying \"I bid $xxx!\")."},{"ai":"Reasoning:\nAppliance O is one of my top priorities with an estimated value of $8800. The starting price is $4000, which is within my budget and offers a significant potential profit. However, I need to consider the competition and the potential bidding war that could drain my budget for other high-priority items.\n\nGiven that there are still multiple high-priority items left, I need to balance my bidding strategy to ensure I have enough funds for the other items. I should also consider the possibility that other bidders might have similar estimated values for Appliance O.\n\nFinal Decision:\nI bid $4100! This bid shows my interest while leaving room to potentially increase my bid if necessary, but not so high that it would significantly impact my budget for the remaining high-priority items. I'll monitor the bidding closely and be prepared to withdraw if the price goes beyond a point where it starts to compromise my overall profit objective."},{"human":"Now, the auctioneer says: \"Thank you!

The auctioneer is now asking for a minimum increase of $400. Given that the next bid would be $4600, it's important to evaluate if this is still within a profitable range for me.\n\nMy estimated value for Appliance O is $8800, and a bid of $4600 would still leave a potential profit of $4200. However, I need to consider the bidding war that could continue and the potential impact on my budget for other high-priority items.\n\nFinal Decision:\nI bid $4600! This bid keeps me in the running for Appliance O while maintaining a potential profit margin. I'll continue to monitor Bidder 3's behavior and be prepared to withdraw if the bidding becomes too aggressive or if it starts to significantly affect my ability to bid on other high-priority items in the auction.","tag":"bid_1"},{"messages":[{"system":"You are Bidder 4, who is attending an ascending-bid auction as a bidder.
