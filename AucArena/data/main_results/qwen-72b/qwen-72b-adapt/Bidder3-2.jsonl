If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Based on the bidding history, Bidder 1 won Widget A at $1500, which is higher than the true value of $2000. Bidder 3 withdrew from the bidding at $1100.\n\nHere's the updated status:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 11600,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 3200,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 800,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 5600\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Appliance O\": 4600,\n      \"Equipment E\": 2700,\n      \"Widget A\": 1500\n    },\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\n      \"Gadget B\": 1200\n    },\n    \"Bidder 3\": {\n      \"Implement G\": 3500,\n      \"Doodad D\": 2200,\n      \"Gizmo F\": 2700\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
