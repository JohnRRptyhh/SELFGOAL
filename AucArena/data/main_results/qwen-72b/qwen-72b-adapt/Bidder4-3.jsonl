Here's the updated strategy:\n\n1. Your primary objective remains the same: maximize profit.\n2. The priority list should be adjusted based on the remaining budget and the potential for profit. Since you've spent $2700 on Gizmo F, the remaining budget is $17300. You've made a profit of $1300, so your effective budget for bidding is now $16000.\n\nConsidering the remaining items and their estimated values, here's the updated priority list:\n\n1. Mechanism J: Priority 3 - High estimated value, bid aggressively but within limits.\n2. Machine P: Priority 3 - Highest estimated value, bid aggressively but maintain a limit to ensure there's enough budget for other high-value items.\n3. Utensil N: Priority 2 - Good value, bid conservatively if you can afford it after bidding on higher priority items.\n4. Contraption I: Priority 2 - Bid conservatively, as it's not as valuable as the top priority items.\n5. Unit Q: Priority 3 - High value, bid aggressively but don't overbid.\n6. Element R: Priority 3 - High value, bid aggressively but don't overbid.\n7. Apparatus H: Priority 2 - Bid conservatively, as it's not as valuable as the top priority items.\n8. Appliance O: Priority 2 - Bid conservatively, if there's enough budget left.\n9. Thingamajig C: Priority 1 - Low value, bid minimally or not at all to save budget for higher priority items.\n10. Gadget B: Priority 1 - Same as Thingamajig C, not a priority.\n11. Widget A: Priority 1 - Low value, bid minimally or not at all.\n12. Doodad D: Priority 2 - Bid conservatively, if there's enough budget left.\n13. Implement G: Priority 2 - Bid conservatively, if there's enough budget left.\n\nUpdated JSON format for priorities:\n```json\n{\n  \"Mechanism J\": 3,\n  \"Machine P\": 3,\n  \"Utensil N\": 2,\n  \"Contraption I\": 2,\n  \"Unit Q\": 3,\n  \"Element R\": 3,\n  \"Apparatus H\": 2,\n  \"Appliance O\": 2,\n  \"Thingamajig C\": 1,\n  \"Gadget B\": 1,\n  \"Widget A\": 1,\n  \"Doodad D\": 2,\n  \"Implement G\": 2\n}\n```\n\nThe main focus should be on the top priority items (Mechanism J, Machine P, Unit Q, and Element R).

The starting price for bidding for Mechanism J is $4000.

Remember, Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some common practices of bidding:\n1. Showing your interest by bidding with or slightly above the starting price of this item, then gradually increase your bid.\n2. Think step by step of the pros and cons and the consequences of your action (e.g., remaining budget in future bidding) in order to achieve your primary objective.\n\n\nGive your reasons first, then make your final decision clearly. You should either withdraw (saying \"I'm out!\") or make a higher bid for this item (saying \"I bid $xxx!\")."},{"ai":"According to my plan, Mechanism J is a top priority item with an estimated value of $8800. The starting price is $4000, which is within the budget and offers a potential for significant profit. However, I need to consider the competition and the potential for the price to rise.\n\nGiven the potential value and the priority assigned to this item, I should show initial interest to compete for it. I will start with a bid slightly above the starting price to signal my interest and see how the other bidders react.\n\nDecision: \"I bid $4100!\" \n\nThis bid allows me to enter the competition without overcommitting early on.

The minimum increase is $400, which means the next bid should be at least $4900.\n\nConsidering the estimated value of Mechanism J at $8800, bidding $4900 still leaves a potential profit of $3900. However, I need to be cautious not to overbid and risk losing potential profit on other high-priority items.\n\nDecision: \"I bid $4900!\" \n\nThis bid keeps me in the competition while maintaining a reasonable profit margin. I will continue to monitor the bidding and be prepared to incrementally increase my bid, but only if it remains profitable and within my budget. If the bidding surpasses a point where the potential profit becomes too low, I will have to consider withdrawing to conserve my budget for other high-value items.","tag":"bid_1"},{"messages":[{"system":"You are Bidder 4, who is attending an ascending-bid auction as a bidder.
