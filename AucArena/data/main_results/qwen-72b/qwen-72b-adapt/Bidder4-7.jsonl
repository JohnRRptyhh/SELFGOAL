No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}. If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format.

Start by focusing on the items with the highest estimated value-to-starting price ratio. These are the items where you can potentially make the most profit if you win them at a reasonable price.\n2. Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other bidders. If an item is getting too much competition, it might be wise to let it go to save your budget for other items with less competition.\n3. Be prepared to walk away if the bidding exceeds your estimated value. This will help you avoid overpaying and protect your budget for future items.\n4.

Bid aggressively on these, but don't exceed your estimated value.\n- Priority 2: These items have a decent value-to-price ratio, but not as high as the top priority items. Bid on them if you have extra budget after securing the top priority items.\n- Priority 1 (lowest priority): These items have lower estimated values or similar values but higher starting prices.

Then, update the status JSON regarding the following information:\n- 'remaining_budget': The remaining budget of you, expressed as a numerical value.\n- 'total_profits': The total profits achieved so far for each bidder, where a numerical value following a bidder's name. No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}. If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format.

Think step by step of the pros and cons and the consequences of your action (e.g., remaining budget in future bidding) in order to achieve your primary objective.\n\n\nGive your reasons first, then make your final decision clearly.

The starting price is $3000, which is relatively low compared to its estimated value. However, I need to consider the potential competition and the impact on my remaining budget for future items.\n\nPros:\n- High potential profit if I win at a reasonable price.\n- It's a top priority item, so securing it could give me a significant advantage.\n\nCons:\n- Bidding could drive up the price, potentially exceeding the estimated value.\n- Spending a significant amount on Apparatus H could limit my ability to bid on other high-priority items.\n\nGiven the situation, I will bid slightly above the starting price to show interest and see how the other bidders react.

However, Bidder 3 has spent significantly more than you, and their last purchase was Gizmo F for $2500. It's unclear if they have enough budget left to compete for Implement G.

You should bid on it with a strategy to not exceed your estimated value, as winning this item could secure your lead in profits. Be prepared to bid aggressively but cautiously, as you don't want to overbid and risk losing your profit margin.\n\nIn the auction, focus on Implement G, and bid strategically to ensure you don't overpay.
