Widget A to Bidder 4 at $1300! The true value for Widget A is $2000.\" \n\n---\n\nCongratuations! You won Widget A at $1300. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding. Here's your previous status:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $20000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n  * Bidder 4: $0\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * No winning bids\n```\n\nSummarize the notable behaviors of all bidders in this round of bidding for future reference. Then, update the status JSON regarding the following information:\n- 'remaining_budget': The remaining budget of you, expressed as a numerical value.\n- 'total_profits': The total profits achieved so far for each bidder, where a numerical value following a bidder's name. No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}. If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Notable behaviors:\n- Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 started with the same initial bid of $1200, but they both withdrew quickly, possibly indicating a lower estimated value for Widget A.\n- Bidder 3 didn't participate in the bidding, which could mean they had a lower estimated value or a more conservative bidding strategy.\n- Bidder 4, as myself, was willing to bid lower initially ($1100) and then raised the bid to $1300, securing the win. This suggests a higher estimated value or a more aggressive strategy.\n\nUpdated status JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 18700,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 0,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 0,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 0,\n    \"Bidder 4\": 700\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {},\n    \"Bidder 2\": {},\n    \"Bidder 3\": {},\n    \"Bidder 4\": {\"Widget A\": 1300}\n  }\n}\n```\nIn this JSON, I've calculated the remaining budget by subtracting the winning bid ($1300) from the initial budget ($20000). The total profit for Bidder 4 is calculated as the difference between the true value ($2000) and the winning bid ($1300). The other bidders have no profits as they didn't win any items. The winning bids section reflects the item won by each bidder.","tag":"summarize_0"},{"messages":[{"system":"You are Bidder 4, who is attending an ascending-bid auction as a bidder.

Start by bidding conservatively on Widget A, Gizmo F, and Thingamajig C, as they have the same estimated value as their starting price. This allows you to secure a potential profit without overextending your budget early on.\n2. For Utensil N, Apparatus H, Contraption I, Appliance O, Mechanism J, Implement G, and Doodad D, bid slightly above the starting price to test the waters. If the bidding doesn't escalate too high, consider continuing, but be prepared to drop out if the price exceeds your estimated value minus a safety margin (e.g., 10%).\n3. Treat Machine P, Unit Q, and Element R as high-priority items, but be cautious. Bid aggressively only if you have enough budget left after securing some of the lower-priority items. These items have a higher estimated value, but their starting prices are also higher, so the risk is greater.\n4. Keep an eye on the bidding patterns of other bidders. If they seem to be more interested in items you consider less valuable, it might be worth bidding more aggressively on those items to maximize your profit potential.\n5. Always maintain a reserve budget to ensure you can participate in the bidding for high-priority items, even if it means letting go of some lower-priority items.\n\nHere's the priority list in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Widget A\": 2,\n  \"Utensil N\": 2,\n  \"Apparatus H\": 2,\n  \"Contraption I\": 2,\n  \"Appliance O\": 2,\n  \"Gizmo F\": 2,\n  \"Mechanism J\": 2,\n  \"Gadget B\": 2,\n  \"Doodad D\": 2,\n  \"Implement G\": 2,\n  \"Machine P\": 3,\n  \"Thingamajig C\": 2,\n  \"Unit Q\": 3,\n  \"Equipment E\": 2,\n  \"Element R\": 3\n}\n```\n\nRemember, the key is to balance risk and reward, and be flexible based on the auction's dynamics.
