Bid conservatively, but be prepared to compete with Bidder 3.\n- Utensil N, Contraption I, and Gizmo F are ranked as 2, as they can still provide a good profit margin if you can secure them at a reasonable price.\n- Doodad D, Gadget B, Thingamajig C, and Equipment E are now ranked as 1, as their estimated values are lower, and it's more important to save your budget for the higher-value items that could potentially give you a larger profit margin.\n- Apparatus H is still ranked as 2, but be cautious with it, as its estimated value is close to the starting price, which might attract aggressive bidding.\n\nRemember to bid conservatively on the high-priority items, increasing your bid only when necessary to outbid other bidders, and stopping when the price approaches 80% of your estimated value to avoid overpaying. Keep an eye on Bidder 2 and Bidder 3's behavior and adjust your strategy accordingly."},{"human":"Now, the auctioneer says: \"Attention, bidders! 11 item(s) left, they are: Thingamajig C, Gizmo F, Machine P, Appliance O, Mechanism J, Doodad D, Contraption I, Equipment E, Utensil N, Gadget B, Apparatus H.\n\nNow, please bid on Thingamajig C.

Then, update the status JSON regarding the following information:\n- 'remaining_budget': The remaining budget of you, expressed as a numerical value.\n- 'total_profits': The total profits achieved so far for each bidder, where a numerical value following a bidder's name. No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}.
