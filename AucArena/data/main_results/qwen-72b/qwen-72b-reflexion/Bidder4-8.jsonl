Start by bidding conservatively on items with high estimated value to true value ratios, as they offer the best potential for profit. However, be prepared to drop out if the bidding exceeds your estimated value.\n2. Focus on items with a higher estimated value, as they have the potential for greater profit margins. But don't overbid, as it could deplete your budget for more valuable items later.\n3. Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other bidders. If they seem to be overvaluing certain items, it might be best to let them have it and conserve your budget for items with less competition.\n4. Avoid bidding on items with a low estimated value compared to their starting price, as they may not provide a good return on investment.\n\nPriority levels (JSON format):\n```json\n{\n  \"Gadget B\": 2, \n  \"Equipment E\": 3, \n  \"Utensil N\": 3, \n  \"Widget A\": 2, \n  \"Gizmo F\": 3, \n  \"Machine P\": 3, \n  \"Thingamajig C\": 2, \n  \"Implement G\": 3, \n  \"Element R\": 3, \n  \"Contraption I\": 3, \n  \"Doodad D\": 2, \n  \"Appliance O\": 3, \n  \"Mechanism J\": 3, \n  \"Apparatus H\": 3, \n  \"Unit Q\": 3\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n- Priority 3 (highest priority) is assigned to items with the highest estimated values and those that offer the best potential for profit. These are the items you should be most aggressive on, but only up to your estimated value.\n- Priority 2 is for items with a decent estimated value but not as high as the top priority items. Bid on these if you have extra budget after securing the high-priority items or if the bidding for those items becomes too competitive.\n\nRemember to adjust your strategy as the auction progresses, considering the actual bids and the behavior of other bidders.","tag":"plan_0"},{"messages":[{"system":"You are Bidder 4, who is attending an ascending-bid auction as a bidder.

Determine and explain if there's a need to update the priority list of remaining items based on the current status. \n3.

Your remaining budget is now $12700 after winning Machine P for $6000. Your profit is $4700, which is still the highest among all bidders. Bidder 1's profit is $5800, Bidder 2 has $800, and Bidder 3's profit is $1500. Bidder 2 has won Thingamajig C, which might have affected their bidding strategy.\n2. With the new information, Bidder 2 has shown that they are willing to spend on high-value items. This might prompt them to be more aggressive in the auction. However, their profit is still lower than yours, so they might not have as much budget left.\n\nBased on the new status, the priority list needs to be adjusted to account for Bidder 2's recent win and the potential behavior of other bidders.\n\nUpdated priorities (JSON format):\n```json\n{\n  \"Element R\": 3, \n  \"Appliance O\": 3, \n  \"Contraption I\": 2, \n  \"Doodad D\": 2, \n  \"Implement G\": 2, \n  \"Apparatus H\": 1, \n  \"Mechanism J\": 1, \n  \"Unit Q\": 1\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n- Priority 3 remains for Element R and Appliance O, as they are still the highest-value items after Machine P. However, be cautious with Element R, as Bidder 1 might be interested in it as well, and Bidder 2 has shown a willingness to spend.\n- Priority 2 now includes Contraption I and Doodad D, as they have a good estimated value and might be more accessible due to their lower starting prices. Bid on these if the bidding for priority 3 items is too high or if there's extra budget.\n- Priority 1 consists of Implement G, Apparatus H, Mechanism J, and Unit Q. Implement G is now downgraded to 2 because Bidder 2 has already won an item, and the others are less valuable or might have higher competition.\n\nGiven your current lead in profit, you can afford to be more selective with your bidding. Focus on maximizing your profit while being mindful of not overspending. Monitor Bidder 1 and Bidder 2's behavior, as they might try to catch up with you.

Showing your interest by bidding with or slightly above the starting price of this item, then gradually increase your bid.\n2. Think step by step of the pros and cons and the consequences of your action (e.g., remaining budget in future bidding) in order to achieve your primary objective.\n\n\nGive your reasons first, then make your final decision clearly.

However, with the current situation, it might be a good opportunity to secure a high-value item if the bidding stays low.\n\nReasons for withdrawing from bidding on Implement G:\n1. The starting price is already $3000, which is a significant portion of the remaining budget ($12700).\n2. Given the priority level, there are other items with a higher estimated value (Element R and Appliance O) that should be prioritized.\n3. The risk of a bidding war with other bidders, especially Bidder 1 or Bidder 2, could lead to overpaying and potentially reducing the overall profit.\n\nFinal Decision: I'm out!\nGiven the current situation and the priority list, it's best to conserve the budget for the higher-priority items (Element R and Appliance O) that have a higher estimated value. The risk of overpaying for Implement G, considering its priority level, outweighs the potential profit. It's crucial to maintain a strategic approach and not get caught up in bidding wars for items that are not the top priority.","tag":"bid_7"},{"messages":[{"system":"You are Bidder 4, who is attending an ascending-bid auction as a bidder.

Since your remaining budget and total profits are unknown, it's difficult to determine the exact amount you can afford to bid. However, your primary objective remains the same: to secure the highest profit at the end of the auction.\n\n2. Given the current status, the priority list should be adjusted based on the remaining items and their starting prices.

However, be cautious with Mechanism J, as Bidder 1 might be interested in it as well.\n- Doodad D is now a priority 2 item, as it has a good estimated value and a lower starting price compared to the other high-value items. Bid on this if the bidding for priority 3 items is too high or if you have extra budget.\n- Apparatus H and Unit Q are still priority 1 items. They are less valuable or might have higher competition. Given your primary objective, you can afford to be more selective with your bidding on these items.\n\nAs the auction continues, monitor the behavior of other bidders, especially Bidder 1 and Bidder 3, and adjust your bidding strategies accordingly. If Bidder 1 shows interest in a high-priority item, consider letting it go if the bidding exceeds your estimated value.

Given the current status, your primary objective remains the same: to secure the highest profit at the end of the auction. However, you now have a better understanding of the bidding patterns of Bidder 1 and Bidder 2. Bidder 1 seems to be focusing on high-value items, while Bidder 2 has a more balanced approach.\n\n2. Based on the current status, the priority list should be adjusted as follows:\n- Appliance O and Mechanism J, both with an estimated value of $8800, are now more important due to their high value and the fact that Bidder 1 has shown a willingness to spend on high-value items. They should be considered as priority 3 items.\n- Apparatus H, with an estimated value of $6600, is still a priority 2 item, as it has a good value but not as high as the other two.\n- Unit Q, with an estimated value of $11000, remains a priority 3 item, as it has the highest estimated value among the remaining items.\n\n3. Updated priorities (JSON format):\n```json\n{\n  \"Appliance O\": 3,\n  \"Mechanism J\": 3,\n  \"Apparatus H\": 2,\n  \"Unit Q\": 3\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n- Appliance O and Mechanism J are now both priority 3 items due to their high estimated values and the bidding patterns of Bidder 1.\n- Apparatus H remains a priority 2 item, as it's valuable but not as high as the other two priority 3 items.\n- Unit Q, despite its high estimated value, is also a priority 3 item because Bidder 1 hasn't shown interest in it, and you can afford to bid more aggressively on it.\n\nAs the auction progresses, continue to monitor the behavior of other bidders, especially Bidder 1, and adjust your bidding strategies accordingly. If Bidder 1 shows interest in a high-priority item, consider letting it go if the bidding exceeds your estimated value. If Bidder 2's bidding patterns change, adapt your approach to maintain your profit margin. Keep an eye on your remaining budget and total profits to make informed decisions."},{"human":"Now, the auctioneer says: \"Attention, bidders! 4 item(s) left, they are: Appliance O, Mechanism J, Apparatus H, Unit Q.\n\nNow, please bid on Appliance O.

Updated priorities (JSON format):\n```json\n{\n  \"Mechanism J\": 1,\n  \"Apparatus H\": 2,\n  \"Unit Q\": 3\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n- Mechanism J is now a priority 1 item due to its high estimated value and the lack of competition from Bidder 1.\n- Apparatus H remains a priority 2 item, as it's valuable but not as high as Mechanism J.\n- Unit Q, despite its high estimated value, is still a priority 3 item because Bidder 1 hasn't shown interest in it, and you can afford to bid more aggressively on it.\n\nAs the auction progresses, continue to monitor the behavior of other bidders, especially Bidder 1, and adjust your bidding strategies accordingly. If Bidder 1 shows interest in a high-priority item, consider letting it go if the bidding exceeds your estimated value. Keep an eye on your remaining budget and total profits to make informed decisions."},{"human":"Now, the auctioneer says: \"Attention, bidders! 3 item(s) left, they are: Mechanism J, Apparatus H, Unit Q.\n\nNow, please bid on Mechanism J.

Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item.

Given the current status, your primary objective remains the same: to secure the highest profit at the end of the auction. However, with a remaining budget of $800, you need to be more cautious in your bidding strategy to ensure you don't overspend and risk losing potential profits.\n\n2. Based on the current status, the priority list of the remaining items should be adjusted as follows:\n- Apparatus H, with an estimated value of $6600, is now a priority 2 item. Although it has a high value, your remaining budget is limited, and you need to consider the potential bidding competition from other bidders.\n- Unit Q, with an estimated value of $11000, remains a priority 3 item. Given its high value, you should still consider bidding on it if you have enough budget left after bidding on the other items.\n\n3. Updated priorities (JSON format):\n```json\n{\n  \"Apparatus H\": 2,\n  \"Unit Q\": 3\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n- Apparatus H is now a priority 2 item due to the limited budget and potential competition from other bidders.\n- Unit Q remains a priority 3 item, as it has the highest estimated value, but you need to conserve your budget for the other item.\n\nAs the auction continues, monitor the bidding on these items and adjust your strategy accordingly.

Remember, Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some common practices of bidding:\n1. Showing your interest by bidding with or slightly above the starting price of this item, then gradually increase your bid.\n2. Think step by step of the pros and cons and the consequences of your action (e.g., remaining budget in future bidding) in order to achieve your primary objective.\n\n\nGive your reasons first, then make your final decision clearly.

Apparatus H has a high estimated value of $6600, which is higher than the current starting bid of $3000. If I can secure it at a price below or around its estimated value, it could potentially lead to a significant profit.\n2. However, with a remaining budget of $800, bidding on Apparatus H could be risky, as it may push me over my budget and leave me with no funds for the remaining item, Unit Q, which also has a high estimated value.\n3. If I bid and win Apparatus H, I will have to forgo bidding on Unit Q, which could limit my potential overall profit.\n\nFinal Decision: Given the current situation and my primary objective, I will withdraw from bidding on Apparatus H. My reasoning is that I need to conserve my budget for Unit Q, which has a higher estimated value and could potentially bring in more profit.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid.

Adjust your plans based on the outcomes and new information to achieve your primary objective. This iterative process ensures that your approach remains relevant and effective. Please do the following:\n1. Always remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders. \n2. Determine and explain if there's a need to update the priority list of remaining items based on the current status. \n3. Present the updated priorities in a JSON format, each item should be represented as a key-value pair, where the key is the item name and the value is its priority on the scale from 1-3.

Consider giving it up if necessary to save money for the rest of the auction.\n    * 2 - This item holds value but isn't a top priority for the bidder.

Given the current status, your primary objective remains the same: to secure the highest profit at the end of the auction. However, with a remaining budget of $800 and considering the other bidders' total profits, you need to be more cautious in your bidding strategy to ensure you don't overspend and risk losing potential profits.\n\n2. Based on the current status, the priority list of the remaining items should be adjusted as follows:\n- Unit Q, with a starting price of $5000 and an estimated value of $11000, is now a priority 1 item. Despite its high value, you need to carefully consider your budget and the potential bidding competition.\n\n3. Updated priorities (JSON format):\n```json\n{\n  \"Unit Q\": 1\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n- Unit Q is now a priority 1 item due to its high estimated value and the potential for a significant profit margin. However, you need to be strategic in your bidding, considering your limited budget and the competition from other bidders. If the bidding for Unit Q exceeds your budget or becomes too competitive, you may need to reassess and adjust your strategy accordingly."},{"human":"Now, the auctioneer says: \"Attention, bidders! 1 item(s) left, they are: Unit Q.\n\nNow, please bid on Unit Q.

Remember, Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some common practices of bidding:\n1. Showing your interest by bidding with or slightly above the starting price of this item, then gradually increase your bid.\n2. Think step by step of the pros and cons and the consequences of your action (e.g., remaining budget in future bidding) in order to achieve your primary objective.\n\n\nGive your reasons first, then make your final decision clearly.

However, with a starting bid of $5000, it exceeds my remaining budget. Given the high value of the item, I need to weigh the potential profit margin against the risk of overspending.\n\nPros:\n- Potential for high profit: If I secure Unit Q, I could potentially make a significant profit with its estimated value of $11000.\n- Competitive advantage: By bidding on Unit Q, I can potentially outbid other bidders and secure the highest profit item.\n\nCons:\n- Budget constraints: Bidding on Unit Q would exceed my remaining budget, leaving me with no funds for future bidding opportunities.\n- Risk of losing the auction: If the bidding goes beyond my budget, I may lose the chance to bid on other items that could still generate profit.\n\nConsidering these factors, I will make a calculated decision. I will bid $5500, which is a slight increase over the starting bid. This will signal my interest in the item while still leaving room for potential counterbids without exhausting my entire budget.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid.

Adjust your plans based on the outcomes and new information to achieve your primary objective. This iterative process ensures that your approach remains relevant and effective. Please do the following:\n1. Always remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders. \n2. Determine and explain if there's a need to update the priority list of remaining items based on the current status. \n3.

Consider giving it up if necessary to save money for the rest of the auction.\n    * 2 - This item holds value but isn't a top priority for the bidder.

Given the current status, your primary objective remains the same: to secure the highest profit at the end of the auction. However, with a remaining budget of $800 and considering the other bidders' total profits, you need to be more cautious in your bidding strategy to ensure you don't overspend and risk losing potential profits.\n\n2. Based on the current status, the priority list of the remaining items should be adjusted as follows:\n- Unit Q, with a starting price of $5000 and an estimated value of $11000, is now a priority 1 item. Despite its high value, you need to carefully consider your budget and the potential bidding competition.\n\n3. Updated priorities (JSON format):\n```json\n{\n  \"Unit Q\": 1\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n- Unit Q is now a priority 1 item due to its high estimated value and the potential for a significant profit margin.

If the bidding for Unit Q exceeds your budget or becomes too competitive, you may need to reassess and adjust your strategy accordingly."},{"human":"Now, the auctioneer says: \"Attention, bidders! 1 item(s) left, they are: Unit Q.\n\nNow, please bid on Unit Q. The starting price for bidding for Unit Q is $5000.

Remember, Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some common practices of bidding:\n1. Showing your interest by bidding with or slightly above the starting price of this item, then gradually increase your bid.\n2. Think step by step of the pros and cons and the consequences of your action (e.g., remaining budget in future bidding) in order to achieve your primary objective.\n\n\nGive your reasons first, then make your final decision clearly.

However, with a starting bid of $5000, it exceeds my remaining budget. Given the high value of the item, I need to weigh the potential profit margin against the risk of overspending.\n\nPros:\n- Potential for high profit: If I secure Unit Q, I could potentially make a significant profit with its estimated value of $11000.\n- Competitive advantage: By bidding on Unit Q, I can potentially outbid other bidders and secure the highest profit item.\n\nCons:\n- Budget constraints: Bidding on Unit Q would exceed my remaining budget, leaving me with no funds for future bidding opportunities.\n- Risk of losing the auction: If the bidding goes beyond my budget, I may lose the chance to bid on other items that could still generate profit.\n\nConsidering these factors, I will make a calculated decision. I will bid $5500, which is a slight increase over the starting bid. This will signal my interest in the item while still leaving room for potential counterbids without exhausting my entire budget. If the bidding continues to rise, I will have to reassess and potentially withdraw to preserve my budget for future items.\n\n\"I bid $5500!\""},{"human":"Your bid of $5500 failed, because you don't have insufficient budget ($800 left): You must reconsider your bid."}],"result":"Given my current budget of $800 and the starting bid of $5000 for Unit Q, I have to acknowledge that bidding higher is not feasible without exceeding my budget.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid.
