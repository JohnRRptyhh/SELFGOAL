Here's the updated priority list:\n\n1. Unit Q: High priority (3) - Despite the high starting price, the estimated value is still significantly higher. Bid aggressively if the price stays below your estimated value, but be cautious due to your limited budget.\n2. Appliance O: Medium priority (2) - Given its high estimated value, it's a good opportunity if you can afford it after Unit Q. Bid if the price is within your estimated value and you have enough budget left.\n3. Equipment E: Medium priority (2) - With a lower estimated value than Unit Q and Appliance O, it's still valuable but not as crucial. Bid if it doesn't compete with higher value items and you have enough budget left.\n4. Contraption I: Low priority (1) - Given its lower estimated value, it's not as important as the other two medium-priority items.

Remember, Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some common practices of bidding:\n1. Showing your interest by bidding with or slightly above the starting price of this item, then gradually increase your bid.\n2. Think step by step of the pros and cons and the consequences of your action (e.g., remaining budget in future bidding) in order to achieve your primary objective.\n\n\nGive your reasons first, then make your final decision clearly.

High estimated value: The estimated value of Unit Q is $11000, which is significantly higher than the starting bid of $5000.\n2. Potential for high profit: If I win Unit Q at a price below my estimated value, the profit margin could be substantial.\n3. Limited competition: If other bidders don't see the same value in Unit Q, I might be able to secure it at a lower price.\n\nReasons to withdraw from bidding on Unit Q:\n1. Limited budget: With only $1500 left, bidding on Unit Q could quickly exhaust my budget, leaving no room for other valuable items.\n2. Risk of overbidding: If the bidding war escalates, I might end up overpaying for Unit Q, which would decrease my potential profit.\n\nGiven the current situation, my primary objective is to secure the highest profit. Since the starting bid for Unit Q is $5000, I can bid slightly above that to show interest, but I need to be cautious not to overbid. With my remaining budget, I can afford to bid up to $5500.\n\nFinal decision: \"I bid $5100!\" This bid allows me to show interest without committing too much of my budget, leaving room for potential future bids on other high-value items. However, if the bidding goes beyond $5500, I will have to withdraw to preserve my budget for other opportunities."},{"human":"Your bid of $5100 failed, because you don't have insufficient budget ($1500 left): You must reconsider your bid."}],"result":"Apologies for the miscalculation.

Monitor the bidding behavior of other bidders, especially Bidder 2, who has a significant profit margin. If the bidding for either item becomes too competitive, consider dropping out to preserve your budget for future auctions or for lower-priority items that might become available."},{"human":"Now, the auctioneer says: \"Attention, bidders! 2 item(s) left, they are: Contraption I, Implement G.\n\nNow, please bid on Contraption I.

Remember, Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some common practices of bidding:\n1. Showing your interest by bidding with or slightly above the starting price of this item, then gradually increase your bid.\n2. Think step by step of the pros and cons and the consequences of your action (e.g., remaining budget in future bidding) in order to achieve your primary objective.\n\n\nGive your reasons first, then make your final decision clearly.

If the bidding escalates significantly, I'm prepared to withdraw to preserve my budget for Implement G or future opportunities."},{"human":"Your bid of $3100 failed, because you don't have insufficient budget ($1500 left): You must reconsider your bid."}],"result":"Reasoning:\n1. My initial bid of $3100 was based on the assumption that it would be a conservative entry into the bidding. However, with only $1500 left in the budget, I need to be more cautious.\n2. Given the starting bid of $3000 and the fact that my estimated value for Contraption I is $6600, bidding any higher would put a strain on my remaining budget.\n3. If I bid too high and win, I might not have enough funds left for Implement G, which is also a medium priority item.\n\nFinal Decision:\nI'm out!

No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}.
