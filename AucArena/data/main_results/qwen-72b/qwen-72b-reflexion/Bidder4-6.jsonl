Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction.

Given the current status, it's crucial to focus on items with lower starting prices and higher estimated values. Bidder 3 has secured high-value items, so you should avoid direct competition with them. However, you should also be cautious not to overbid, as your budget is limited.\n\n3. The updated priority list, considering the new information, is as follows:\n\n- Gizmo F: Despite its lower starting price, it's still a priority due to its high estimated value and the potential for a good profit margin.\n- Implement G: With a lower starting price, it's a secondary option if you can afford it without compromising your chances of winning Gizmo F.\n- Equipment E: Similar to Implement G, it's a potential target if you have enough budget left after bidding on Gizmo F.\n- Unit Q and Mechanism J: These items have higher starting prices, making them less attractive options given your limited budget.\n- Appliance O: Although it has a similar starting price to Implement G and Equipment E, its estimated value is lower, making it less of a priority.\n\nUpdated priorities (JSON format):\n```json\n{\n  \"Gizmo F\": 3,\n  \"Implement G\": 2,\n  \"Equipment E\": 2,\n  \"Unit Q\": 1,\n  \"Mechanism J\": 1,\n  \"Appliance O\": 1\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- Gizmo F is assigned priority 3 because it offers the best potential for profit within your budget.\n- Implement G and Equipment E are both assigned priority 2, as they are secondary options if you have enough budget left after bidding on Gizmo F.\n- Unit Q, Mechanism J, and Appliance O are assigned priority 1, as their starting prices exceed your budget, and bidding on them would likely result in a bidding war with Bidder 3 or overspending.\n\nRemember to bid conservatively, focusing on Gizmo F first, and then considering Implement G or Equipment E if you have enough budget remaining.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction. You can use them to guide this auction:\n```\nReflections:\n-\nReflections:\n-\nReflections:\n-\nReflections:\n-\nReflections:\n-.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\nReflections:\n-.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\nReflections:\n-.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nReflections:\n-.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nReflections:\n-.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nReflections:\n-.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n```"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $700\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $1700\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $6500\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Gadget B: $1200\n    * Widget A: $1100\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * Apparatus H: $3500\n    * Element R: $6000\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

The updated priority list, considering the new information, is as follows:\n\n- Gizmo F: With a lower starting price and a high estimated value, it's still a priority due to its potential for a good profit margin.\n- Implement G: This item has a lower starting price and a decent estimated value, making it a secondary option if you can afford it without compromising your chances of winning Gizmo F.\n- Equipment E: Similar to Implement G, it's a potential target if you have enough budget left after bidding on Gizmo F.\n- Appliance O: Although it has a similar starting price to Implement G and Equipment E, its estimated value is the same as Gizmo F, but it may be less attractive due to Bidder 3's focus on high-value items.\n- Mechanism J: With a higher starting price, it's less of a priority given your budget constraints.\n\nUpdated priorities (JSON format):\n```json\n{\n  \"Gizmo F\": 3,\n  \"Implement G\": 2,\n  \"Equipment E\": 2,\n  \"Appliance O\": 2,\n  \"Mechanism J\": 1\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- Gizmo F is assigned priority 3 because it offers the best potential for profit within your budget.\n- Implement G and Equipment E are both assigned priority 2, as they are secondary options if you have enough budget left after bidding on Gizmo F.\n- Appliance O is also assigned priority 2, as it has a similar estimated value to Gizmo F but may be less attractive due to Bidder 3's strategy.\n- Mechanism J is assigned priority 1, as its starting price exceeds your budget, and bidding on it would likely result in a bidding war with Bidder 3 or overspending.\n\nRemember to bid conservatively, focusing on Gizmo F first, and then considering Implement G or Equipment E if you have enough budget remaining. Avoid getting into bidding wars with Bidder 3, as they have a higher total profit and may be more willing to overbid."},{"human":"Now, the auctioneer says: \"Attention, bidders! 5 item(s) left, they are: Mechanism J, Gizmo F, Appliance O, Implement G, Equipment E.\n\nNow, please bid on Mechanism J.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction. You can use them to guide this auction:\n```\nReflections:\n-\nReflections:\n-\nReflections:\n-\nReflections:\n-\nReflections:\n-.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\nReflections:\n-.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\nReflections:\n-.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nReflections:\n-.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nReflections:\n-.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nReflections:\n-.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nReflections:\n-.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\nReflections:\n-.\n\n```"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Appliance O:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $4500\n- Bidder 2: $4200\n- Bidder 3: $4200\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

With Bidder 3 having a significant lead in total profits, your primary objective remains the same, but you need to be more strategic in your bidding to maximize your chances of making a profit without overspending. Given the current situation, it's crucial to focus on items with lower starting prices and higher estimated values, while avoiding direct competition with Bidder 3.\n\n2. The current status indicates that Bidder 3 is targeting high-value items, as they have won Apparatus H and Element R. To avoid direct competition with them, you should focus on items that are less likely to attract their attention. However, you should also be cautious not to overbid, as your budget is limited.\n\n3. The updated priority list, considering the new information, is as follows:\n\n- Appliance O: With a lower starting price and a high estimated value, it's now the top priority due to its potential for a good profit margin.\n- Implement G: This item has a lower starting price and a decent estimated value, making it a secondary option if you can afford it without compromising your chances of winning Appliance O.\n- Equipment E: With the lowest starting price, it's a potential target if you have enough budget left after bidding on Appliance O and Implement G.\n\nUpdated priorities (JSON format):\n```json\n{\n  \"Appliance O\": 3,\n  \"Implement G\": 2,\n  \"Equipment E\": 1\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- Appliance O is assigned priority 3 because it offers the best potential for profit within your budget.\n- Implement G is assigned priority 2, as it's a secondary option if you have enough budget left after bidding on Appliance O.\n- Equipment E is assigned priority 1, as it's the least important item in terms of potential profit, but it can still be considered if you have extra budget.\n\nRemember to bid conservatively, focusing on Appliance O first, and then considering Implement G if you have enough budget remaining. Avoid getting into bidding wars with Bidder 3, as they have a higher total profit and may be more willing to overbid."},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $700\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $5200\n  * Bidder 2: $1500\n  * Bidder 3: $6500\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Gadget B: $1200\n    * Widget A: $1100\n    * Appliance O: $4500\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Gizmo F: $2500\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * Apparatus H: $3500\n    * Element R: $6000\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Given the current status, your primary objective remains the same, but you need to be more cautious with your bidding strategy. Bidder 3 has a significantly higher total profit, so you should focus on items that can provide a good profit margin without directly competing with them. Since Bidder 3 has already won high-value items, they may not be interested in the remaining items.\n\n2. The priority list of remaining items should be adjusted based on the current status and the potential for profit. With a limited budget of $700, you need to be selective in your bidding.\n\n3. The updated priorities for the remaining items are as follows:\n\n- Implement G: Despite its high estimated value, the starting price of $3000 is quite steep, and it might not be feasible to bid on it with your current budget. However, if you can manage it without compromising your chances of winning other items, it could still provide a good profit margin. Priority: 2\n- Equipment E: With a lower starting price and a decent estimated value, Equipment E is a more suitable choice for your current budget. It offers a good opportunity to increase your total profit without getting into bidding wars with Bidder 3. Priority: 3\n\nUpdated priorities (JSON format):\n```json\n{\n  \"Implement G\": 2,\n  \"Equipment E\": 3\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- Implement G is assigned priority 2, as it's a secondary option if you can manage the bid within your budget.\n- Equipment E is assigned priority 3, as it's a more feasible choice given your current budget and can help increase your total profit.\n\nIn this situation, focus on bidding for Equipment E first, as it's more likely to be within your budget. If you win Equipment E and still have some budget left, consider bidding on Implement G, but be prepared to let it go if the bidding goes beyond your budget. Remember to stay disciplined and avoid overbidding to ensure you achieve the highest profit possible.","tag":"plan_13"},{"messages":[{"system":"You are Bidder 4, who is attending an ascending-bid auction as a bidder. This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item.

Consider giving it up if necessary to save money for the rest of the auction.\n    * 2 - This item holds value but isn't a top priority for the bidder. Could bid on it if you have enough budget.\n    * 3 - This item is of utmost importance and is a top priority for the bidder in the rest of the auction."},{"ai":"1. Given the current status, your primary objective remains the same, but you need to be more cautious with your bidding strategy. Bidder 3 has a significantly higher total profit, so you should focus on items that can provide a good profit margin without directly competing with them. Since Bidder 3 has already won high-value items, they may not be interested in the remaining items.\n\n2. The priority list of remaining items should be adjusted based on the current status and the potential for profit. With a limited budget of $700, you need to be selective in your bidding.\n\n3. The updated priorities for the remaining items are as follows:\n\n- Implement G: Despite its high estimated value, the starting price of $3000 is quite steep, and it might not be feasible to bid on it with your current budget. However, if you can manage it without compromising your chances of winning other items, it could still provide a good profit margin. Priority: 2\n- Equipment E: With a lower starting price and a decent estimated value, Equipment E is a more suitable choice for your current budget. It offers a good opportunity to increase your total profit without getting into bidding wars with Bidder 3. Priority: 3\n\nUpdated priorities (JSON format):\n```json\n{\n  \"Implement G\": 2,\n  \"Equipment E\": 3\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- Implement G is assigned priority 2, as it's a secondary option if you can manage the bid within your budget.\n- Equipment E is assigned priority 3, as it's a more feasible choice given your current budget and can help increase your total profit.\n\nIn this situation, focus on bidding for Equipment E first, as it's more likely to be within your budget. If you win Equipment E and still have some budget left, consider bidding on Implement G, but be prepared to let it go if the bidding goes beyond your budget. Remember to stay disciplined and avoid overbidding to ensure you achieve the highest profit possible."},{"human":"Now, the auctioneer says: \"Attention, bidders! 2 item(s) left, they are: Implement G, Equipment E.\n\nNow, please bid on Implement G.

Showing your interest by bidding with or slightly above the starting price of this item, then gradually increase your bid.\n2. Think step by step of the pros and cons and the consequences of your action (e.g., remaining budget in future bidding) in order to achieve your primary objective.\n\n\nGive your reasons first, then make your final decision clearly.

Implement G has a high estimated value, but the starting price of $3000 is close to my remaining budget. Bidding on this item could potentially lead to a bidding war with Bidder 3, who has a higher total profit and might be willing to outbid me to secure a higher profit.\n2. If I bid on Implement G and win, I will have less budget for the remaining item, Equipment E, which could limit my potential profit from the auction.\n3. If I don't bid on Implement G, I can save my budget for Equipment E, which has a lower starting price and a better chance of being within my budget.\n\nFinal Decision: Given the current situation and to maintain a disciplined bidding strategy, I will withdraw from bidding on Implement G.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction.

Given the current status, your primary objective remains the same, but you need to be more cautious with your bidding strategies. Bidder 3 has a significantly higher total profit, so you should focus on items that can provide a good profit margin without directly competing with them. Since Bidder 3 has already won high-value items, they may not be interested in the remaining items.\n\n2.

Showing your interest by bidding with or slightly above the starting price of this item, then gradually increase your bid.\n2. Think step by step of the pros and cons and the consequences of your action (e.g., remaining budget in future bidding) in order to achieve your primary objective.\n\n\nGive your reasons first, then make your final decision clearly.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item.

Given the current status, your primary objective remains the same, but you need to be more cautious with your bidding strategies. Bidder 3 has a significantly higher total profit, so you should focus on items that can provide a good profit margin without directly competing with them. Since Bidder 3 has already won high-value items, they may not be interested in the remaining items.\n\n2. The priority list of remaining items should be adjusted based on the current status and the potential for profit. Equipment E has a lower starting price and a decent estimated value, making it a more suitable choice for your current budget.\n\n3. The updated priorities for the remaining items are as follows:\n\n- Equipment E: With a lower starting price and a decent estimated value, Equipment E is a more suitable choice for your current budget.

Remember, Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some common practices of bidding:\n1. Showing your interest by bidding with or slightly above the starting price of this item, then gradually increase your bid.\n2. Think step by step of the pros and cons and the consequences of your action (e.g., remaining budget in future bidding) in order to achieve your primary objective.\n\n\nGive your reasons first, then make your final decision clearly.

If you don't bid, you risk losing the opportunity to increase your total profit.\n\nFinal Decision: I bid $2200!\n\nThis bid is slightly above the starting price, showing your interest in the item while leaving room for potential counterbids.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction. You can use them to guide this auction:\n```\nReflections:\n-\nReflections:\n-\nReflections:\n-\nReflections:\n-\nReflections:\n-.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\nReflections:\n-.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\nReflections:\n-.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nReflections:\n-.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nReflections:\n-.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nReflections:\n-.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nReflections:\n-.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\nReflections:\n-.\nReflections:\n-.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nReflections:\n-.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n```"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Equipment E:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $2500\n- Bidder 2: $2500\n- Bidder 3: $2500\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Equipment E, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Equipment E. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.

No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}. If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format.
