Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1.

However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item.

Bidding even slightly above this would exceed my available funds.\n2. **Potential for High Loss**: If I were to bid and win, the profit would be the difference between the true value ($6600) and the winning bid. However, given my limited budget, I cannot risk losing a significant amount if the bidding goes beyond my means.\n3. **Risk of Overestimation**: My estimated value of $6600 could be an overestimation, and the true value might be lower. Bidding without knowing the true value exposes me to the risk of making a loss.\n4. **Future Opportunities**: Withdrawing from this bid allows me to conserve my budget for future auctions or potential opportunities that might arise during this auction.\n\nFinal Decision: **I'm out!**\n\nGiven the circumstances, it's best to conserve my budget and look for more favorable opportunities where I can better utilize my funds and minimize the risk of loss.","tag":"bid_14"},{"messages":[{"system":"You are Bidder 4, who is attending an ascending-bid auction as a bidder. This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget."},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Implement G:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3500\n- Bidder 2: $3500\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Implement G, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Implement G. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.
