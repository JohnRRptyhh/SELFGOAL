Here's your previous status:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $20000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n  * Bidder 4: $0\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * No winning bids\n```\n\nSummarize the notable behaviors of all bidders in this round of bidding for future reference. Then, update the status JSON regarding the following information:\n- 'remaining_budget': The remaining budget of you, expressed as a numerical value.\n- 'total_profits': The total profits achieved so far for each bidder, where a numerical value following a bidder's name. No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}. If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Notable behaviors:\n1. Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 withdrew from the auction early, possibly indicating they had lower estimated values for Gadget B or a more conservative bidding strategy.\n2. Bidder 3 started with a bid of $1200 and then withdrew in Round 1, suggesting they might have had a maximum bid limit or felt the item was not worth going higher.\n3. Bidder 4 (you) matched Bidder 3's initial bid and then placed a higher bid of $1300 in Round 1, eventually winning the item. This shows a willingness to outbid others but with a controlled increase.\n\nUpdated status JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 18700,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 0,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 0,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 0,\n    \"Bidder 4\": 700\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {},\n    \"Bidder 2\": {},\n    \"Bidder 3\": {},\n    \"Bidder 4\": {\"Gadget B\": 1300}\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this JSON, your remaining budget is $18700 (initial $20000 - winning bid of $1300), total profit is $700 (true value of $2000 - winning bid of $1300), and you have a winning bid for Gadget B at $1300.","tag":"summarize_0"},{"messages":[{"system":"You are Bidder 4, who is attending an ascending-bid auction as a bidder.

Start by bidding conservatively on items with a high estimated value and low starting price (Gadget B, Contraption I, Utensil N, Widget A) to potentially secure a good profit margin while not exhausting your budget early.\n2. For items with the same estimated value, prioritize those with lower starting prices (Gadget B, Thingamajig C, Widget A) to maximize profit.\n3. Bid aggressively on items with the highest estimated values (Equipment E, Element R, Unit Q, Appliance O, Machine P, Gizmo F) but only if the bidding doesn't exceed your estimated value minus a safety margin (e.g., 10-20%).\n4. For items with the same estimated value, bid more cautiously if there are duplicates (Element R, Unit Q) as you might have a chance to win one of them at a later stage.\n5. Avoid bidding on items with lower estimated values (Gadget B, Thingamajig C, Widget A, Gizmo F) if they reach their estimated value, as the profit margin would be slim.\n6. If you win an item with a high estimated value, be more selective in bidding on subsequent items to conserve your budget for the remaining high-priority items.\n\nHere's the priority list in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Gadget B\": 3,\n  \"Contraption I\": 3,\n  \"Utensil N\": 3,\n  \"Widget A\": 3,\n  \"Equipment E\": 2,\n  \"Element R\": 2,\n  \"Unit Q\": 2,\n  \"Appliance O\": 2,\n  \"Machine P\": 2,\n  \"Gizmo F\": 2,\n  \"Thingamajig C\": 1,\n  \"Utensil N\": 1,\n  \"Contraption I\": 1,\n  \"Gadget B\": 1,\n  \"Apparatus H\": 1,\n  \"Implement G\": 1,\n  \"Doodad D\": 1,\n  \"Mechanism J\": 1\n}\n```\n\nNote: The priorities for Utensil N, Contraption I, and Gadget B are listed as both 1 and 3.
