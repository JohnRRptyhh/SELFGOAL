Equipment E to Bidder 4 at $2700! The true value for Equipment E is $4000.\" \n\n---\n\nCongratuations! You won Equipment E at $2700. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding. Here's your previous status:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $10000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $1500\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Doodad D: $2500\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Mechanism J: $4900\n    * Machine P: $5100\n```\n\nSummarize the notable behaviors of all bidders in this round of bidding for future reference. Then, update the status JSON regarding the following information:\n- 'remaining_budget': The remaining budget of you, expressed as a numerical value.\n- 'total_profits': The total profits achieved so far for each bidder, where a numerical value following a bidder's name. No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}. If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Notable behaviors:\n- Bidder 1 started with a high bid of $2500 but withdrew early, possibly indicating a higher estimated value or a limited budget.\n- Bidder 2 and Bidder 3 withdrew without making any bids, suggesting they either had lower estimated values or were more cautious with their budgets.\n- Bidder 4 was the only bidder who stayed in the competition, increasing the bid from $2200 to $2700, indicating a willingness to pay more than the initial bids from other bidders.\n\nUpdated status:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 7300,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 1300,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 1500,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 0\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {},\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\"Doodad D\": 2500},\n    \"Bidder 3\": {},\n    \"Bidder 4\": {\"Mechanism J\": 4900, \"Machine P\": 5100, \"Equipment E\": 2700}\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote: The remaining budget for Bidder 4 is calculated as $10000 (initial budget) - $2700 (winning bid for Equipment E). The total profit for Bidder 4 is not provided, but it can be calculated as the difference between the true value of Equipment E ($4000) and the winning bid ($2700), which is $1300.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget."},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $3200\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $5300\n  * Bidder 2: $4000\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n  * Bidder 4: $13200\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Element R: $5500\n    * Widget A: $1200\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Doodad D: $2500\n    * Contraption I: $3500\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Mechanism J: $4900\n    * Machine P: $5100\n    * Equipment E: $2700\n    * Utensil N: $4100\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Notable behaviors:\n- Bidder 1 started with a relatively low bid, then withdrew in Round 1, possibly indicating a conservative bidding strategy or a lower estimated value for Gadget B.\n- Bidder 2 initially bid aggressively, outbidding both Bidder 1 and Bidder 3, and eventually won Gadget B. This suggests a high estimated value or a strong desire for the item.\n- Bidder 3's bid was between Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 but still withdrew, possibly due to a higher risk-aversion or a closer estimate to the true value.\n\nUpdated status JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 3200,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 5300,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 7500,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 800\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Element R\": 5500,\n      \"Widget A\": 1200\n    },\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\n      \"Doodad D\": 2500,\n      \"Contraption I\": 3500,\n      \"Appliance O\": 4500,\n      \"Gadget B\": 1500\n    },\n    \"Bidder 3\": {\n      \"Thingamajig C\": 1200\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
