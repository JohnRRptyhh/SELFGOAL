This indicates a potential for high profit if I can acquire the item at a reasonable price.\n2. **Remaining Budget**: I have $1200 left in my budget. Bidding $3000 would deplete my entire budget, leaving no room for future bidding or potential higher profits from other items that might appear.\n3. **Risk vs. Reward**: Bidding $3000 is risky since it's a large portion of my budget, but the potential profit is substantial if no one outbids me. If the bidding goes significantly higher, I might have to let it go to avoid potential losses.\n4. **Other Bidders**: I need to consider the behavior of other bidders. If they have a lower estimated value or are running low on budget, they might not bid aggressively.\n\nBased on these considerations, I will make a conservative opening bid to show my interest and test the waters.\n\nDecision: **I bid $3100!** This bid is slightly above the starting price, allowing me to enter the bidding without overcommitting too early. I will then monitor the auction and adjust my bids accordingly, depending on the reactions of other bidders and the item's true value."},{"human":"Your bid of $3100 failed, because you don't have insufficient budget ($1200 left): You must reconsider your bid."}],"result":"Apologies for the oversight. Given my remaining budget of $1200, I cannot bid $3100.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget."},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Implement G:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3500\n- Bidder 2: $3500\n- Bidder 3: $3500\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3: $3800\n\nRound 2:\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
