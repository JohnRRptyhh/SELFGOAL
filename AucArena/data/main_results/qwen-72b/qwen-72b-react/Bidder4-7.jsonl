Avoid bidding wars on items with similar estimated values, especially if they have close starting prices. This will help conserve your budget for more valuable items.\n3. Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other bidders. If an item's bidding exceeds its estimated value, it's best to let it go to avoid potential losses.\n4.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget."},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $11200\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $3800\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Utensil N: $4200\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Mechanism J: $4900\n    * Gadget B: $1200\n    * Doodad D: $2700\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Be cautious and only bid if it won't significantly impact your overall profit lead.\n- Priority 0: Thingamajig C remains a low priority due to its low estimated value.

Do I have any advance on $3500?\""}],"result":"Given the current situation, the bidding has already reached $3500, which is higher than my initial bid. However, it's still below the estimated value of Apparatus H. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The item's estimated value is $6600, so there's still a potential for profit at this price.\n2. I have a remaining budget of $3900, which allows me to increase my bid.\n3. Bidder 1 and Bidder 3 are currently tied at $3500, and I need to outbid them to stay in the game.\n\nFinal Decision:\nI bid $3800! This bid is $300 above the current highest bid, which is the minimum increase required. It's still below the estimated value and within my budget, but it's a strategic move to potentially discourage other bidders from continuing the bidding war. I'll be prepared to withdraw if the bidding exceeds my estimated value or significantly impacts my remaining budget.","tag":"bid_14"},{"messages":[{"system":"You are Bidder 4, who is attending an ascending-bid auction as a bidder. This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget."},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Apparatus H:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3500\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3: $3500\n- Bidder 4: $3100\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $3800\n\nRound 2:\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
