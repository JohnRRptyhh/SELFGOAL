Start by bidding conservatively on items with a high estimated value to true value ratio (items with a higher chance of generating profit). This will help you secure items that offer the best value while preserving your budget.\n2. Avoid bidding wars on items with similar estimated values, as this could lead to overpaying and depleting your budget quickly.\n3. Keep an eye on the bidding patterns of other bidders. If an item's bidding exceeds its estimated value, it's best to let it go.\n4.

Bid on them if they remain affordable after securing the high-priority items.\n- Items with a priority of 1 are not included, as all items have some estimated value, and it's not recommended to completely ignore any of them.
