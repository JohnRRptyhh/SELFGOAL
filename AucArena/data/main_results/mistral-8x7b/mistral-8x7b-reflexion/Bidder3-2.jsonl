Present the updated priorities in a JSON format, each item should be represented as a key-value pair, where the key is the item name and the value is its priority on the scale from 1-3.

Consider giving it up if necessary to save money for the rest of the auction.\n    * 2 - This item holds value but isn't a top priority for the bidder.
