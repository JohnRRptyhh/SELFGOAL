If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Based on the bidding history, Bidder 3 won Appliance O at $5000, which is lower than the true value of $8000. Bidder 1 withdrew from the bidding, and Bidder 2 and Bidder 4 also withdrew. \n\nThe updated status is as follows:\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 1300,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 11300,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 4300,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 4800\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Equipment E\": 2700,\n      \"Element R\": 6000,\n      \"Implement G\": 3500,\n      \"Machine P\": 6500\n    },\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\n      \"Widget A\": 1200,\n      \"Utensil N\": 4500\n    },\n    \"Bidder 3\": {\n      \"Gadget B\": 1200,\n      \"Unit Q\": 6000,\n      \"Appliance O\": 5000\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
