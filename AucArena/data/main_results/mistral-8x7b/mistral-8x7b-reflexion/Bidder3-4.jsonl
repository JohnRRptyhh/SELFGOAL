If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"In this round of bidding:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew without placing a bid.\n- Bidder 2 placed a bid of $4500 in the first round and then withdrew in the second round.\n- Bidder 3 placed a winning bid of $5000 in the second round.\n\nBased on this information, the updated status is as follows:\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 8500,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 11000,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 3300,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 3000\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Unit Q\": 6000,\n      \"Machine P\": 5500,\n      \"Implement G\": 3500\n    },\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\n      \"Apparatus H\": 3500,\n      \"Widget A\": 1200\n    },\n    \"Bidder 3\": {\n      \"Element R\": 6500,\n      \"Utensil N\": 5000\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
