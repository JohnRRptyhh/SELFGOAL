You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Budget Check: Before placing a bid, ensure that the remaining budget allows for potential bidding wars for higher-value items.\n - Strategic Bidding: If the bidding remains below your estimated value of $8800, consider placing a bid close to the current highest bid but below your estimated value. This could deter other bidders and secure the item at a lower price.\n - Strategic Bidding on Apparatus H: Continue bidding for Apparatus H, but be prepared to drop out if the bidding exceeds your estimated value of $6600. This is to prevent overinvestment in an item that may not yield a high profit margin.\n - Monitor Bidder 2: Bidder 2 has a higher estimated value for Machine P compared to you, as indicated by their $6000 bid on Unit Q. Monitor their bidding behavior closely. If the bidding for Machine P starts to exceed your estimated value, consider focusing on Unit Q.\n - Patience: Wait for the right moment to place your bids. If other bidders are engaged in a bidding war for a different item, it might be the perfect time to secure \"Contraption I\" and \"Equipment E\".\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Equipment E:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $2500\n- Bidder 2: $2500\n- Bidder 3: $2500\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1: $2700\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n\nRound 2:\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Adjust your bidding based on the competition, but be cautious not to overspend.'}\n - Conserve Remaining Budget: With only $899 left, it's crucial to be extremely selective in the remaining bids. The current budget is not sufficient for any of the remaining items, given their starting prices and your estimated values.\n - Monitor Bidder 2's behavior: Since Bidder 2 has shown a higher willingness to pay for Machine P, it's crucial to keep an eye on their bidding pattern.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Prioritize High-Value Items: Since your estimated value for Doodad D and Gizmo F is $4400 each, prioritize these items in your bidding strategy. However, be mindful of the starting prices and the bidding behavior of other participants.\n - Observe the reaction of other bidders at the starting price: Observe how other bidders respond to the starting price to gauge the level of competition and interest in the item.\n - Consider Estimated Value: The estimated value for Implement G is $6600. Given the current state, aim to win this item at a price as close to the starting price ($3000) as possible, to maximize profit.\n - Strategic bidding: Based on the previous bidding pattern, the starting price of $5,000 seems to be a psychological barrier for most bidders. If the bidding remains below $8,800 (your estimated value for Utensil N), consider placing a strategic bid around $8,000 to $8,500. This could potentially discourage other bidders and secure the item at a lower price.\n - Monitor Initial Bids: Pay close attention to the initial bids on Widget A. If the bids are significantly lower than your estimated value of $2200, consider bidding aggressively but strategically.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Implement G:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3500\n- Bidder 2: $3200\n- Bidder 3: $3200\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Here's your previous status:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $899\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $8100\n  * Bidder 2: $4500\n  * Bidder 3: $2400\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Appliance O: $4500\n    * Apparatus H: $3500\n    * Equipment E: $2700\n    * Thingamajig C: $1200\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Element R: $5500\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * Widget A: $1100\n    * Doodad D: $2500\n```\n\nSummarize the notable behaviors of all bidders in this round of bidding for future reference. Then, update the status JSON regarding the following information:\n- 'remaining_budget': The remaining budget of you, expressed as a numerical value.\n- 'total_profits': The total profits achieved so far for each bidder, where a numerical value following a bidder's name. No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}. If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format.
