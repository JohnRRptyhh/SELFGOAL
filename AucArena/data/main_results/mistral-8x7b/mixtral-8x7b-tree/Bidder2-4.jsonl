Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1.

However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget."},{"human":"As Bidder 2, you have a total budget of $20000.

If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Based on the bidding history, Bidder 1, Bidder 2, and Bidder 3 all bid $5000 for Appliance O in Round 0. However, all bidders withdrew in Round 1, resulting in no winning bid for Appliance O.\n\nHere's the updated status:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 20000,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 6000,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 0,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 4000\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Implement G\": 3500,\n      \"Utensil N\": 4500\n    },\n    \"Bidder 2\": {},\n    \"Bidder 3\": {\n      \"Element R\": 6000\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
