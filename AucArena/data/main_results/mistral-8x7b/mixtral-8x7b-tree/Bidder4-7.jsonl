Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Identify Competition Intensity: Based on the bidding patterns, determine the intensity of competition for specific price ranges. For example, you have won items in the $1000 to $1200 range, but not in the $2000 to $2500 range. This could indicate that the competition is more aggressive in the higher price ranges.\n - Consider Starting Prices: Take into account the starting prices of the remaining items. Items with lower starting prices might attract less competition, allowing you to potentially secure them at a lower price.\n - Analyze Bidders' Behavior: Based on the auction log, Bidder 3 seems to have a lower estimated value for Gadget B and Equipment E compared to Bidder 4. This could indicate that Bidder 3 might have a different estimation approach or lower budget, which could influence the bidding dynamics for the remaining items.\n - Identify Potential Targets: Items Gizmo F, Implement G, Doodad D, and Apparatus H have a significant difference between the starting price and Bidder 4's estimated value. These could be potential targets for higher profit margins.\n - Consider the Number of Remaining Items: With 12 items left in the auction, it's important to spread the remaining budget wisely.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Focus on items with a lower starting price: Prioritize items with starting prices closer to $1000, as these will provide a better chance of staying within the desired range.\n - Avoid bidding wars: Since you have won 100% of the items you participated in within this range, it's crucial to avoid getting into bidding wars that could drive up the price.\n - Monitor other bidders' behavior: Keep an eye on the bidding patterns of Bidder 1 and Bidder 3, as they have not won any items in this range yet. If they start bidding more aggressively on items within this range, be prepared to adjust your strategy.\n - Maintain a buffer: Ensure that you leave some budget as a buffer for potential price increases. This will help avoid exceeding the $1200 limit and still have enough budget for future items.\n - Prioritize items with higher profit potential: Among the items within the $1000 to $1200 range, prioritize those with the highest difference between your estimated value and the starting price. This will help maximize your profits.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $12200\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $4000\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n  * Bidder 4: $4200\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Machine P: $6000\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Gadget B: $1200\n    * Equipment E: $2700\n    * Widget A: $1200\n    * Gizmo F: $2700\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1.

You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Focus on items with a lower starting price: Prioritize items with starting prices closer to $1000, as these will provide a better chance of staying within the desired range.\n - Avoid bidding wars: Since you have won 100% of the items you participated in within this range, it's crucial to avoid getting into bidding wars that could drive up the price.\n - Monitor other bidders' behavior: Keep an eye on the bidding patterns of Bidder 1 and Bidder 3, as they have not won any items in this range yet. If they start bidding more aggressively on items within this range, be prepared to adjust your strategy.\n - Maintain a buffer: Ensure that you leave some budget as a buffer for potential price increases. This will help avoid exceeding the $1200 limit and still have enough budget for future items.\n - Prioritize items with higher profit potential: Among the items within the $1000 to $1200 range, prioritize those with the highest difference between your estimated value and the starting price. This will help maximize your profits.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Implement G:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3500\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3: $3200\n- Bidder 4: $3100\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $3800\n\nRound 2:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Focus on Estimated Profit Ratio: Prioritize items with a higher estimated profit ratio (estimated value divided by starting price). This will help in identifying items where the potential profit is significant compared to the initial investment.\n - Maintain Discipline: Stick to the strategy of prioritizing lower-priced items, and avoid getting lured into bidding on higher-priced items, even if they seem profitable. The focus should be on maximizing the profit-to-investment ratio.\n - Minimum Buffer Requirement: Set a minimum buffer percentage, such as 10-20% of the remaining budget, to ensure there is always some budget left for unpredictable price increases.\n - Element R: Since this item has the highest estimated value, prioritize it in your bidding. Aim to win it at a price as close as possible to your estimated value but not exceeding $10000 to maximize your profit.\n - Element R and Unit Q: With starting prices of $5000 and estimated values of $11000, these items should be your last priority.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Initial Bid Strategy: Start with a bid close to the starting price, for example, $2100 or $2200. This would be higher than the starting price but still provide a reasonable profit margin.\n - Patience: Refrain from increasing your bid too quickly. Allow other bidders to make their moves, and only increase your bid if necessary to stay in the competition.\n - Aim for a hammer price around $6000: This would result in a profit of $1000 and an estimated profit ratio of 55%. Although this is slightly lower than the 60% target, it is the best possible ratio given the higher starting price and estimated value.\n - Maintain Budget: With a remaining budget of $2900, ensure that you don't overspend on Appliance O. Keep in mind that there is one more item (Apparatus H) left in the auction.\n - Incremental Bids for Apparatus H: The starting price for Apparatus H is $3000. Since your estimated value is $6600, you should aim to bid up to your estimated value while keeping an eye on the remaining budget.
