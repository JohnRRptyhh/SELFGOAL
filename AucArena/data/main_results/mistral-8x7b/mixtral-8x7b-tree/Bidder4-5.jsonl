This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Accurate Value Estimation: Strive to estimate the true value of each item as accurately as possible. Overestimation could lead to overspending, while underestimation could result in missing out on profitable opportunities.\n - Budget Management: Keep track of your total budget and ensure that you do not exceed it. Winning items at lower prices can help you maximize your profit.\n - Strategic Bidding: Consider the starting price and your estimated value for each item. If your estimated value is significantly higher than the starting price, it might be worth bidding more aggressively. However, if the gap is small, it might be better to be more conservative in your bidding to save budget for potentially more profitable items.\n - Monitoring Competition: Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other bidders. If a bidder drops out, it might indicate that they have a lower estimated value for the item, which could be an opportunity for you to increase your bid.\n - Prioritizing Items: Based on your estimated values, prioritize the items you want to win.

You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Revise your bidding strategy: Based on the information gathered so far, adjust your bidding strategy for the remaining items. For example, if you believe that your estimated value for Utensil N is too high, you might want to start with a lower bid and increase it more conservatively.\n - Monitor your remaining budget: Keep an eye on your remaining budget and ensure that you are not overspending on items. If you have a smaller budget left, you might want to be more conservative in your bidding to ensure that you can participate in the bidding for more profitable items later in the auction.\n - Prioritize Items with Higher Profit Potential: Focus on items with a higher difference between your estimated value and the starting price. For example, Gadget B and Thingamajig C have a higher potential for profit compared to Apparatus H.\n - Utensil N: The starting price is $4000, and your estimated value is $8800. This item has a significant gap between the starting price and your estimated value, making it a potentially profitable opportunity. You might consider bidding more aggressively, but be cautious not to overspend.\n - Adapt to Changing Competition: As the auction progresses, the competition may change. Some bidders may run out of budget, while others may become more aggressive. Stay flexible and adapt your strategy to the changing competition to maximize your profits.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Utensil N:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $4500\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3: $4500\n- Bidder 4: $4500\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $4900\n\nRound 2:\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

This buffer can help you participate in bidding wars for items with higher profit potential.\n - Adjust Bidding Strategy: If other bidders drop out early, you might consider increasing your bids more rapidly to secure the item at a lower price.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Gizmo F: With a starting price close to your remaining budget, you need to be cautious. Start with a bid of $1300, and if other bidders drop out quickly, you can consider increasing your bid to around $1800-1900. However, be prepared to drop out if the bidding exceeds your estimated value.\n - Unit Q: Similar to Element R, start with a bid around $5500-5700. If other bidders drop out, increase your bid to around $8500-9000. Keep in mind your budget and avoid exceeding $10000.\n - Preserve budget for higher-value items: Keep in mind that there are several high-value items remaining in the auction. Ensure you have enough budget to compete for those items if necessary.\n - Consider the Risk-to-Profit Ratio: Doodad D and Gizmo F have a higher starting price and a lower estimated value compared to some other items. Weigh the risk of overestimating the true value against the potential profit to make informed bidding decisions.\n - Re-evaluate Estimated Value: As the auction progresses, you might gain more information about the true value of Mechanism J. If you find that your estimated value is too high or too low, adjust your bidding strategy accordingly.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Gizmo F:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $2500\n- Bidder 2: $2500\n- Bidder 3: $2500\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Gizmo F, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Gizmo F. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value.

To maintain a reasonable profit, you should aim for a profit of at least $5,500 (your previous total profits of $10,000 minus the estimated value of Unit Q). This means your suggested maximum bid should be around $5,500 or less.\n - Unit Q: Your estimated value for this item is $11000, and your remaining budget is $0 after winning the previous items. You will need to increase your budget by winning more items or potentially skip this item if the bidding price exceeds your estimated value.\n - Bid Increment: Decide on a reasonable bid increment that allows you to increase your chances of winning while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin.\n - Set a Bid Limit: Establish a maximum bid limit for Equipment E based on your estimated value and the competition. This will help you avoid overspending and ensure a profitable transaction.\n - Budget Check: Before placing any bids, ensure that you have enough budget to cover the remaining items. Given that you have already won 6 items, your budget should be $10,000 - $6,500 - $4,900 - $3,800 - $2,000 - $1,500 - $1,300 = $0. It seems like you have exceeded your budget in the previous rounds.
