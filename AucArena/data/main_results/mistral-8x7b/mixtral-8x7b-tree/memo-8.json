Engage in the bidding war but be prepared to drop out if the price becomes too high.","26":"Maintain financial flexibility: With a remaining budget of $9000, be cautious when bidding on higher-priced items to ensure you have enough budget to compete for the items with the highest estimated values.","27":"Monitor competitor behavior: Keep track of the bidding patterns of Bidders 1 and 2. If Bidder 2, who has a higher total profit, seems to be less active or has a lower remaining budget, seize the opportunity to secure high-value items.","28":"Evaluate risk vs. reward: Consider the risk of losing a high-value item against the potential reward of securing it. Balance this equation to make informed bidding decisions.","29":"Set a threshold for low-value items: Establish a maximum bid price for low-value items based on their starting price and your estimated value. For example, for items starting at $4000 or less, set a threshold of 60% of your estimated value.","30":"Maintain a balance between competition and budget preservation: Ensure that you are actively participating in bidding wars for high-value items while avoiding unnecessary bidding for low-value items.","31":"Calculate the opportunity cost of bidding: Before increasing a bid, consider the potential profit from the item and weigh it against the potential profit from other upcoming items.

This will help in monitoring the overall progress towards the goal of maximizing profit.","67":"Compare starting price with estimated value: For each item, calculate the ratio of the starting price to your estimated value. A lower ratio indicates a more favorable starting price.","68":"Assess competition: Analyze the bidding behavior of other bidders during the initial bids. If there are fewer bidders or lower initial bids, it might be worthwhile to continue bidding, even if the starting price is higher.","69":"Prioritize items based on your estimated values: Rank the remaining items by your estimated values. This will help you focus on items with higher potential profits and make more informed decisions during the auction.","70":"Adjust bidding strategy based on item value: For high-value items, consider being more aggressive in the bidding process, as the potential profit is higher. For lower-value items, be more cautious and weigh the potential profit against the remaining budget.","71":"Consider bidding early on low-value items: If you have a high estimated value for an item with a low starting price, consider placing an early bid to discourage other bidders and secure the item at a lower price.","72":"Keep track of remaining budget: Always be aware of your remaining budget and adjust your bidding strategy accordingly. Avoid overcommitting to a single item, as it may hinder your ability to participate in future auctions.","73":"Stay patient and disciplined: Refrain from impulsive bidding and maintain a disciplined approach. Stick to your estimated values and budget, and avoid getting caught up in bidding wars with other bidders.","74":"Learn from competitor behavior: Take note of the bidding patterns of other bidders and adapt your strategy to counter their moves. If a particular bidder tends to drop out early, consider bidding more aggressively when they are involved. If a bidder consistently outbids you, reassess your strategy and consider adjusting your estimated values or budget."}},"arms_cnt":{"Bidder 1":[],"Bidder 2":[],"Bidder 3":[],"Bidder 4":[1,3,20,34,51,67,67,75,75,75]},"model_info":{"Bidder 1":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 2":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 3":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 4":"mixtral-8x7b"}}
