This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Aggressively bid on high-value items: Since Bidders 1, 2, and 3 have shown less interest in higher-priced items, Bidder 4 should consider being more aggressive in bidding on items with higher estimated values, such as Element R, Unit Q, Machine P, and Appliance O.\n - Conserve budget for valuable items: Since Bidder 4 has a limited budget of $12,200 and there are several high-value items remaining, it is essential to conserve budget for these items. Be cautious when bidding on lower-value items to ensure sufficient budget remains for valuable items.\n - Calibrate bidding strategy based on estimated values: Use the estimated values as a guide for determining the maximum bid for each item. Avoid overpaying for items, as the true value is unknown. Strive to win items at a price close to the estimated value or lower to maximize profits.\n - Maintain a safety margin: Keep a safety margin for each item to avoid overcommitting to a single item and potentially missing out on others. A suggested safety margin could be around 20-30% of the starting price, depending on the competition.\n - Adjust bidding strategy: If you notice that other bidders are more aggressive than expected, consider adjusting your bidding strategy to secure the higher-value items. You might need to increase your safety margin or be prepared to drop out earlier than planned.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $12200\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n  * Bidder 4: $2200\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Equipment E: $4000\n    * Contraption I: $3800\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Aggressively bid on high-value items: Since Bidders 1, 2, and 3 have shown less interest in higher-priced items, Bidder 4 should consider being more aggressive in bidding on items with higher estimated values, such as Element R, Unit Q, Machine P, and Appliance O.\n - Conserve budget for valuable items: Since Bidder 4 has a limited budget of $12,200 and there are several high-value items remaining, it is essential to conserve budget for these items. Be cautious when bidding on lower-value items to ensure sufficient budget remains for valuable items.\n - Calibrate bidding strategy based on estimated values: Use the estimated values as a guide for determining the maximum bid for each item. Avoid overpaying for items, as the true value is unknown. Strive to win items at a price close to the estimated value or lower to maximize profits.\n - Maintain a safety margin: Keep a safety margin for each item to avoid overcommitting to a single item and potentially missing out on others. A suggested safety margin could be around 20-30% of the starting price, depending on the competition.\n - Adjust bidding strategy: If you notice that other bidders are more aggressive than expected, consider adjusting your bidding strategy to secure the higher-value items. You might need to increase your safety margin or be prepared to drop out earlier than planned.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Element R:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $5500\n- Bidder 3: $6000\n- Bidder 4: $5500\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $6500\n\nRound 2:\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

This information could be useful in predicting their future participation in the auction.\n - Analyze the remaining budget and profits: With a remaining budget of $3000, Bidder 4 has already made a total profit of $7000. This means that Bidder 4 has a total budget of $10,000 ($3000 + $7000) to consider for the remaining items.\n - Calculate profit margins: To set a profit threshold, Bidder 4 should consider the estimated value of each item and the starting price to determine a reasonable profit margin. For example, Bidder 4 can target a profit margin of 30% for each item. This would mean that the minimum profit for each item would be: - Unit Q: $3300 (11000 x 0.3) - Implement G: $2200 (6600 x 0.3) - Machine P: $3300 (11000 x 0.3) - Mechanism J: $2640 (8800 x 0.3) - Widget A: $660 (2200 x 0.3) - Gadget B: $660 (2200 x 0.3) - Appliance O: $2640 (8800 x 0.3) - Thingamajig C: $660 (2200 x 0.3) - Gizmo F: $1320 (4400 x 0.3) - Apparatus H: $2200 (6600 x 0.3) - Utensil N: $2640 (8800 x 0.3)\n - Consider bidding more conservatively on items with low starting prices: Since you have a limited budget, it might be wise to bid more conservatively on items with low starting prices, even if your estimated value is higher, to save budget for items with higher starting prices.\n - Stay informed about competitor budgets: While the exact budgets of competitors are unknown, their past bidding behavior can provide insights.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Monitor competitor behavior: Continue observing the bidding patterns of Bidders 1, 2, and 3. Their early withdrawal from bidding on higher-priced items suggests they might have lower budgets or less interest in valuable items. This information could be useful in predicting their future participation in the auction.\n - Analyze the remaining budget and profits: With a remaining budget of $3000, Bidder 4 has already made a total profit of $7000. This means that Bidder 4 has a total budget of $10,000 ($3000 + $7000) to consider for the remaining items.\n - Calculate profit margins: To set a profit threshold, Bidder 4 should consider the estimated value of each item and the starting price to determine a reasonable profit margin. For example, Bidder 4 can target a profit margin of 30% for each item. This would mean that the minimum profit for each item would be: - Unit Q: $3300 (11000 x 0.3) - Implement G: $2200 (6600 x 0.3) - Machine P: $3300 (11000 x 0.3) - Mechanism J: $2640 (8800 x 0.3) - Widget A: $660 (2200 x 0.3) - Gadget B: $660 (2200 x 0.3) - Appliance O: $2640 (8800 x 0.3) - Thingamajig C: $660 (2200 x 0.3) - Gizmo F: $1320 (4400 x 0.3) - Apparatus H: $2200 (6600 x 0.3) - Utensil N: $2640 (8800 x 0.3)\n - Consider bidding more conservatively on items with low starting prices: Since you have a limited budget, it might be wise to bid more conservatively on items with low starting prices, even if your estimated value is higher, to save budget for items with higher starting prices.\n - Stay informed about competitor budgets: While the exact budgets of competitors are unknown, their past bidding behavior can provide insights.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Monitor competitor behavior: Continue observing the bidding patterns of Bidders 1, 2, and 3. Their early withdrawal from bidding on higher-priced items suggests they might have lower budgets or less interest in valuable items. This information could be useful in predicting their future participation in the auction.\n - Analyze the remaining budget and profits: With a remaining budget of $3000, Bidder 4 has already made a total profit of $7000. This means that Bidder 4 has a total budget of $10,000 ($3000 + $7000) to consider for the remaining items.\n - Calculate profit margins: To set a profit threshold, Bidder 4 should consider the estimated value of each item and the starting price to determine a reasonable profit margin. For example, Bidder 4 can target a profit margin of 30% for each item. This would mean that the minimum profit for each item would be: - Unit Q: $3300 (11000 x 0.3) - Implement G: $2200 (6600 x 0.3) - Machine P: $3300 (11000 x 0.3) - Mechanism J: $2640 (8800 x 0.3) - Widget A: $660 (2200 x 0.3) - Gadget B: $660 (2200 x 0.3) - Appliance O: $2640 (8800 x 0.3) - Thingamajig C: $660 (2200 x 0.3) - Gizmo F: $1320 (4400 x 0.3) - Apparatus H: $2200 (6600 x 0.3) - Utensil N: $2640 (8800 x 0.3)\n - Consider bidding more conservatively on items with low starting prices: Since you have a limited budget, it might be wise to bid more conservatively on items with low starting prices, even if your estimated value is higher, to save budget for items with higher starting prices.\n - Stay informed about competitor budgets: While the exact budgets of competitors are unknown, their past bidding behavior can provide insights.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Monitor Bidder 1's participation in items with starting prices around or below $2000, such as Widget A, Gadget B, and Thingamajig C.: This involves closely observing Bidder 1's behavior in auctions with items that have starting prices around or below $2000, such as Widget A, Gadget B, and Thingamajig C.\n - Keep track of Bidder 1's remaining budget and total profits to assess their overall performance and position in the auction. This information can help you make more informed decisions about your own bidding strategy.: Monitoring Bidder 1's remaining budget and total profits can provide valuable insights into their overall performance and position in the auction, which can in turn help you make more informed decisions about your own bidding strategy.\n - Prioritize items: Based on your estimated values and the remaining budget, rank the remaining items in order of priority. This will help you make more informed decisions when participating in bidding wars for these items.\n - Maintain a balance between estimated value and true value: Keep in mind that your estimated value might differ from the true value. Make sure to balance your bids based on the starting price and your estimated value, while also considering the competition from other bidders.\n - Be cautious with items close to the estimated value: For items like Mechanism J and Gizmo F, be cautious with your bidding, as the difference between your estimated value and the starting price is relatively small. Avoid getting into bidding wars that could drive the price close to or equal to your estimated value.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $3000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $3500\n  * Bidder 3: $6500\n  * Bidder 4: $7000\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * Unit Q: $6000\n    * Implement G: $3500\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Equipment E: $4000\n    * Contraption I: $3800\n    * Element R: $6500\n    * Doodad D: $2700\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

This could increase your chances of winning items with a higher profit margin, given that Bidder 1 has a lower total profit.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Gadget B:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $1100\n- Bidder 2: $1100\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $1100\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $1200\n\nRound 2:\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item.

If Bidder 4 believes they can win the item at a price close to the starting price, it might be worth bidding. However, if the bidding war escalates significantly, Bidder 4 may want to reconsider their involvement in the bidding process for this item.\n - Apparatus H: This item has the highest estimated value-to-starting price ratio. If other bidders do not show much interest, aim to secure this item at a reasonable price, as it has the potential to generate a substantial profit.\n - Consider potential collaborations: If Bidder 4 has established a good relationship with other bidders (e.g., Bidder 2 or Bidder 3), explore the possibility of collaborating to outbid Bidder 1 in high-profit items. This strategy can help distribute the cost and risk while maximizing the overall profit.\n - Avoid bidding wars with Bidder 2: Since Bidder 2 has a higher total profit, it is best to avoid prolonged bidding wars with them, especially on lower-value items. Instead, focus on securing high-value items where Bidder 2 may not be as interested.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Thingamajig C:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $1100\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Focus on higher-priced items: With Bidder 1's limited budget, Bidder 4 should prioritize bidding on the remaining higher-priced items (Apparatus H and Utensil N) where Bidder 1 is less likely to participate due to their budget constraints.\n - Observe Bidder 1's behavior in the bidding for Thingamajig C: If Bidder 1 wins this item at a significantly higher price than the starting price, it may indicate a genuine interest in the item rather than a focus on low-priced items.\n - General: {'Prioritize items with higher potential profits and lower starting prices to maximize your chances of winning and maintaining budget flexibility': '', 'Be prepared to drop out of bidding wars that become too expensive, as your remaining budget is quite limited': ''}\n - Set a target price: Calculate a target price for Apparatus H based on its estimated value and the starting price. For example, aiming for a winning bid around 60-70% of the estimated value ($6600) would be a reasonable target. In this case, the target price would be around $4000-$4620.\n - Be prepared to exit early: If the bidding war for Apparatus H escalates quickly and reaches the target price, consider withdrawing from the auction to preserve the remaining budget for future auctions.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $600\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $900\n  * Bidder 2: $3500\n  * Bidder 4: $8600\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Thingamajig C: $1100\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Gadget B: $1200\n    * Equipment E: $4000\n    * Contraption I: $3800\n    * Element R: $6500\n    * Doodad D: $2700\n    * Widget A: $1200\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.
