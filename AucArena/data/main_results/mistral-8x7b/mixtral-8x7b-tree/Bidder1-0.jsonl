If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Based on the bidding history, here's a summary of the notable behaviors of all bidders in this round:\n\n- Bidder 1 initially bid $3500 in Round 0 but withdrew in Round 1.\n- Bidder 2 initially bid $3500 in Round 0, then increased the bid to $3800 in Round 1, ultimately winning Implement G at $3800.\n- Bidder 3 initially bid $3200 in Round 0 and withdrew in Round 1.\n- Bidder 4 withdrew in Round 0.\n\nNow, let's update the status JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 11500,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 5500,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 8800\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Equipment E\": 2500,\n      \"Element R\": 6000\n    },\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\n      \"Unit Q\": 5500,\n      \"Mechanism J\": 4500,\n      \"Thingamajig C\": 1200,\n      \"Implement G\": 3800\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
