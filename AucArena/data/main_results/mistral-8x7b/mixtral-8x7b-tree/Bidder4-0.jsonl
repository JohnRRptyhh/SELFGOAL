For example, Appliance O and Utensil N have estimated values that are twice their starting prices, making them attractive targets for bidding.\n - Adjust Bids Based on Estimated Value: When placing bids, consider the estimated value of the item and the current price. Aim to bid at a price that is closer to the estimated value, but also take into account the potential competition from other bidders.\n - Balance Risk and Reward: Consider the potential profit from each item and weigh it against the risk of overpaying. For example, bidding on an item with a high estimated value but also a high starting price may be riskier than bidding on an item with a lower starting price.\n - Anticipate potential competition: Based on the behavior of Bidder 1 and Bidder 2, it is likely that they will continue to bid aggressively for items with high estimated values. It may be beneficial to anticipate potential competition from these bidders for items such as Appliance O, Utensil N, Widget A, Apparatus H, Unit Q, Machine P, Mechanism J, Element R, and Doodad D.\n - Set a Bid Limit: Determine the maximum bid for each potential target based on the estimated value and the competition.

Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Utensil N: Aim to secure this item at a price as close to the starting price as possible, while keeping an eye on the competition.\n - Increase Bid Incrementally: If other bidders outbid you, increase your bid incrementally, staying as close to the starting price as possible. This will help you maintain a profitable margin while still remaining competitive.\n - Adjust Bidding Strategy Based on Previous Items: If you were able to secure the previous items (Appliance O and Utensil N) at a lower price than your estimated value, you may have a larger budget to bid more aggressively for Widget A. However, if you overspent on the previous items, you may need to be more cautious with your bidding strategy for Widget A.\n - Set a Price Threshold: Determine a maximum price that Bidder 4 is willing to pay for each of these items based on their estimated value and the starting price. If the bidding price exceeds this threshold, it may be best to withdraw from the bidding war.\n - Equipment E: Your estimated value is $4400, and the starting price is $2000. You can aim to bid up to $2,400 to secure a profit of at least $2,000. However, given the lower estimated value, be prepared to adjust your bid based on the behavior of other bidders.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $unknown\n\n* Total Profits:\n\n* Winning Bids:\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Evaluate True Value: Continuously evaluate the true value of the item based on the bidding behavior of other bidders. If the true value is lower than the estimated value, consider withdrawing from the auction to avoid overpaying.\n - Keep Track of Total Profits: Keep track of your total profits and remaining budget. Use this information to make informed decisions about which items to bid on and how aggressively to bid.\n - Prioritize Items: Prioritize the remaining items based on their estimated values and starting prices. Focus on securing items with high estimated values and low starting prices, and be prepared to walk away from items with low potential profit margins.\n - Evaluate Competition: Consider the competition for each item. If there are multiple bidders aggressively pursuing the same item, it may be better to walk away and focus on items with less competition.\n - Be Prepared to Drop Out: If the bidding war for Widget A escalates beyond your estimated value of $2200, be prepared to drop out of the auction. Overpaying for an item will negatively impact your overall profitability.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $unknown\n\n* Total Profits:\n\n* Winning Bids:\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Monitor budget constraints: Bidders 2 and 3 have already won items and have lower remaining budgets. Use this information to your advantage by targeting items with higher starting prices and estimated values.\n - Target high-value items: With a remaining budget of $4080, focus on items with higher starting prices and estimated values. This will maximize your potential profits and minimize the risk of overpaying.\n - Place a Strategic Initial Bid: Place an initial bid close to the starting price, but slightly higher to signal seriousness. This will also help to avoid bidding wars with other bidders who may have lower estimated values.\n - Analyze Bidding Patterns: Observe the bidding behavior of other bidders to identify any patterns or trends. For example, if a bidder tends to bid in increments of $500, this could provide insight into their maximum bid for a particular item.\n - Avoid Overpaying: Be cautious when bidding on items with high starting prices, even if they have high estimated values. Overpaying can reduce overall profits.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $unknown\n\n* Total Profits:\n\n* Winning Bids:\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Use this information to your advantage by targeting items with higher starting prices and estimated values.\n - Target high-value items: With a remaining budget of $4080, focus on items with higher starting prices and estimated values. This will maximize your potential profits and minimize the risk of overpaying.\n - Place a Strategic Initial Bid: Place an initial bid close to the starting price, but slightly higher to signal seriousness. This will also help to avoid bidding wars with other bidders who may have lower estimated values.\n - Analyze Bidding Patterns: Observe the bidding behavior of other bidders to identify any patterns or trends. For example, if a bidder tends to bid in increments of $500, this could provide insight into their maximum bid for a particular item.\n - Avoid Overpaying: Be cautious when bidding on items with high starting prices, even if they have high estimated values. Overpaying can reduce overall profits.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Contraption I:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3500\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $3100\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 4: $3800\n\nRound 2:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Monitor Mechanism J closely: With a starting price of $4000 and an estimated value of $8800, this item is a high-value target. However, be cautious of potential competition from Bidder 2, who has a higher remaining budget.\n - Mechanism J: Your estimated value is $8800, and the starting price is $4000. Based on previous hammer prices, you have been able to secure items with an average winning margin of around $2030. Therefore, a more realistic estimated value for Mechanism J could be $6030 ($4000 starting price + $2030 average winning margin).\n - Consider Bidding on Lower-Value Items: If the competition is low, consider bidding on items with lower estimated value but also low starting prices. This could help increase total profits and provide more opportunities to bid on higher-value items later in the auction.\n - Evaluate the Competition: Based on the auction log, Bidder 2 and Bidder 3 have higher total profits than Bidder 4. Be cautious when bidding against these bidders, especially if the starting price of the item is high.\n - Monitor bidding activity: Keep a close eye on the bidding activity of competitors to gauge their level of interest and commitment. Look for signs of hesitation, aggressive bidding, or sudden changes in behavior that may indicate their intentions.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $280\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $4500\n  * Bidder 3: $5000\n  * Bidder 4: $12280\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Unit Q: $5500\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * Machine P: $5000\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Gadget B: $1300\n    * Appliance O: $4600\n    * Utensil N: $4900\n    * Widget A: $1320\n    * Apparatus H: $3800\n    * Contraption I: $3800\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Monitor Mechanism J closely: With a starting price of $4000 and an estimated value of $8800, this item is a high-value target. However, be cautious of potential competition from Bidder 2, who has a higher remaining budget.\n - Mechanism J: Your estimated value is $8800, and the starting price is $4000. Based on previous hammer prices, you have been able to secure items with an average winning margin of around $2030. Therefore, a more realistic estimated value for Mechanism J could be $6030 ($4000 starting price + $2030 average winning margin).\n - Consider Bidding on Lower-Value Items: If the competition is low, consider bidding on items with lower estimated value but also low starting prices. This could help increase total profits and provide more opportunities to bid on higher-value items later in the auction.\n - Evaluate the Competition: Based on the auction log, Bidder 2 and Bidder 3 have higher total profits than Bidder 4. Be cautious when bidding against these bidders, especially if the starting price of the item is high.\n - Monitor bidding activity: Keep a close eye on the bidding activity of competitors to gauge their level of interest and commitment.

Bidder 4 should wait for the right moment to place their bid, ideally when other bidders have exhausted their budgets or are no longer interested in the item.\n - Consider Thingamajig C, Doodad D, and Gizmo F: These items have starting prices of $1000 or $2000 and estimated values of $2200 or $4400. They could be potential targets if the competition is low and the prices remain close to the starting prices.\n - Doodad D and Gizmo F: Your estimated value for both items is $4400, and the starting prices are $2000. Based on the previous hammer prices, you have been able to secure items with an average winning margin of around $2030. Therefore, a more realistic estimated value for both Doodad D and Gizmo F could be $4030 ($2000 starting price + $2030 winning margin).\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $280\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $5500\n  * Bidder 2: $8000\n  * Bidder 3: $5000\n  * Bidder 4: $12280\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Equipment E: $2500\n    * Element R: $6000\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Unit Q: $5500\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * Machine P: $5000\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Gadget B: $1300\n    * Appliance O: $4600\n    * Utensil N: $4900\n    * Widget A: $1320\n    * Apparatus H: $3800\n    * Contraption I: $3800\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Avoid Bidding Wars with Bidder 2: Bidder 4 should avoid bidding wars with Bidder 2, especially for items with high starting prices and estimated values.\n - Monitor Competition: Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other bidders for Gizmo F. If other bidders drop out early, Bidder 4 can secure the item at a lower price.\n - Wait for the Right Moment: Patience can be a valuable strategy in auctions. Bidder 4 should wait for the right moment to place their bid, ideally when other bidders have exhausted their budgets or are no longer interested in the item.\n - Consider Thingamajig C, Doodad D, and Gizmo F: These items have starting prices of $1000 or $2000 and estimated values of $2200 or $4400. They could be potential targets if the competition is low and the prices remain close to the starting prices.\n - Doodad D and Gizmo F: Your estimated value for both items is $4400, and the starting prices are $2000. Based on the previous hammer prices, you have been able to secure items with an average winning margin of around $2030. Therefore, a more realistic estimated value for both Doodad D and Gizmo F could be $4030 ($2000 starting price + $2030 winning margin).\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Doodad D:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $2500\n- Bidder 2: $2500\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Doodad D, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Doodad D. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.
