Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Adjust Bids Strategically: If Bidder 3 or any other bidder drops out, consider lowering the bid to secure the item at a lower price while maintaining a reasonable profit margin.\n - Reserve Budget: Ensure there is sufficient budget left for future items, especially those with higher estimated values and profit potential.\n - Re-evaluate Profit Margin: Continuously assess the profit margin based on the current bid and the estimated value of Machine P. If the profit margin is too low, consider withdrawing from the bidding to preserve the budget for other items.\n - Equipment E: {'Aggressive Bidding': 'Enter the bidding war aggressively but remain vigilant about the bidding behavior of other participants.', 'Set Bidding Limit': 'Set a bidding limit to ensure a reasonable profit margin and avoid overpaying.'}\n - Equipment E: {'Guideline': 'With a low reward-to-risk ratio, it might be more beneficial to focus on other items with higher profit potential unless the competition is minimal and the bidding does not drive up the price significantly.'}\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $10300\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n  * Bidder 4: $4300\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Doodad D: $2700\n    * Machine P: $7000\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Initial Bid: Enter the bidding at or slightly above the starting price, around $5100 to $5200, to secure the item without significantly overpaying.\n - Monitor Competition: Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other participants, especially Bidder 3, who also showed interest in Machine P.\n - Monitor Bidder 3: Since Bidder 3 has dropped out in the previous rounds, keep a close eye on their bidding behavior in the remaining items. If they start bidding again, reassess the competition and adjust the bidding strategy accordingly.\n - Analyze Competition: Identify items with less competition based on the previous bidding behavior. This can help in securing items with higher profit margins while avoiding unnecessary bidding wars.\n - Gizmo F: Aim to secure this item at the starting price or slightly higher, leaving enough budget for future items with higher profit potential.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $2900\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $2500\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n  * Bidder 4: $8900\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Implement G: $3500\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Doodad D: $2700\n    * Machine P: $7000\n    * Equipment E: $2900\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Initial Bid: Enter the bidding at or slightly above the starting price, around $5100 to $5200, to secure the item without significantly overpaying.\n - Monitor Competition: Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other participants, especially Bidder 3, who also showed interest in Machine P.\n - Monitor Bidder 3: Since Bidder 3 has dropped out in the previous rounds, keep a close eye on their bidding behavior in the remaining items. If they start bidding again, reassess the competition and adjust the bidding strategy accordingly.\n - Analyze Competition: Identify items with less competition based on the previous bidding behavior. This can help in securing items with higher profit margins while avoiding unnecessary bidding wars.\n - Gizmo F: Aim to secure this item at the starting price or slightly higher, leaving enough budget for future items with higher profit potential.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $2900\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $2500\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n  * Bidder 4: $8900\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Implement G: $3500\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Doodad D: $2700\n    * Machine P: $7000\n    * Equipment E: $2900\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Initial Bid: Enter the bidding at or slightly above the starting price, around $5100 to $5200, to secure the item without significantly overpaying.\n - Monitor Competition: Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other participants, especially Bidder 3, who also showed interest in Machine P.\n - Monitor Bidder 3: Since Bidder 3 has dropped out in the previous rounds, keep a close eye on their bidding behavior in the remaining items. If they start bidding again, reassess the competition and adjust the bidding strategy accordingly.\n - Analyze Competition: Identify items with less competition based on the previous bidding behavior. This can help in securing items with higher profit margins while avoiding unnecessary bidding wars.\n - Gizmo F: Aim to secure this item at the starting price or slightly higher, leaving enough budget for future items with higher profit potential.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $2900\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $2500\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n  * Bidder 4: $8900\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Implement G: $3500\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Doodad D: $2700\n    * Machine P: $7000\n    * Equipment E: $2900\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Initial Bid: Enter the bidding at or slightly above the starting price, around $5100 to $5200, to secure the item without significantly overpaying.\n - Monitor Competition: Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other participants, especially Bidder 3, who also showed interest in Machine P.\n - Monitor Bidder 3: Since Bidder 3 has dropped out in the previous rounds, keep a close eye on their bidding behavior in the remaining items. If they start bidding again, reassess the competition and adjust the bidding strategy accordingly.\n - Analyze Competition: Identify items with less competition based on the previous bidding behavior. This can help in securing items with higher profit margins while avoiding unnecessary bidding wars.\n - Gizmo F: Aim to secure this item at the starting price or slightly higher, leaving enough budget for future items with higher profit potential.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $2900\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $2500\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n  * Bidder 4: $8900\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Implement G: $3500\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Doodad D: $2700\n    * Machine P: $7000\n    * Equipment E: $2900\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Initial Bid: Enter the bidding at or slightly above the starting price, around $5100 to $5200, to secure the item without significantly overpaying.\n - Monitor Competition: Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other participants, especially Bidder 3, who also showed interest in Machine P.\n - Monitor Bidder 3: Since Bidder 3 has dropped out in the previous rounds, keep a close eye on their bidding behavior in the remaining items. If they start bidding again, reassess the competition and adjust the bidding strategy accordingly.\n - Analyze Competition: Identify items with less competition based on the previous bidding behavior. This can help in securing items with higher profit margins while avoiding unnecessary bidding wars.\n - Gizmo F: Aim to secure this item at the starting price or slightly higher, leaving enough budget for future items with higher profit potential.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $2900\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $2500\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n  * Bidder 4: $8900\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Implement G: $3500\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Doodad D: $2700\n    * Machine P: $7000\n    * Equipment E: $2900\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Initial Bid: Enter the bidding at or slightly above the starting price, around $5100 to $5200, to secure the item without significantly overpaying.\n - Monitor Competition: Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other participants, especially Bidder 3, who also showed interest in Machine P.\n - Monitor Bidder 3: Since Bidder 3 has dropped out in the previous rounds, keep a close eye on their bidding behavior in the remaining items. If they start bidding again, reassess the competition and adjust the bidding strategy accordingly.\n - Analyze Competition: Identify items with less competition based on the previous bidding behavior. This can help in securing items with higher profit margins while avoiding unnecessary bidding wars.\n - Gizmo F: Aim to secure this item at the starting price or slightly higher, leaving enough budget for future items with higher profit potential.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $2900\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $2500\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n  * Bidder 4: $8900\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Implement G: $3500\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Doodad D: $2700\n    * Machine P: $7000\n    * Equipment E: $2900\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Initial Bid: Enter the bidding at or slightly above the starting price, around $5100 to $5200, to secure the item without significantly overpaying.\n - Monitor Competition: Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other participants, especially Bidder 3, who also showed interest in Machine P.\n - Monitor Bidder 3: Since Bidder 3 has dropped out in the previous rounds, keep a close eye on their bidding behavior in the remaining items. If they start bidding again, reassess the competition and adjust the bidding strategy accordingly.\n - Analyze Competition: Identify items with less competition based on the previous bidding behavior. This can help in securing items with higher profit margins while avoiding unnecessary bidding wars.\n - Gizmo F: Aim to secure this item at the starting price or slightly higher, leaving enough budget for future items with higher profit potential.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $2900\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $2500\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n  * Bidder 4: $8900\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Implement G: $3500\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Doodad D: $2700\n    * Machine P: $7000\n    * Equipment E: $2900\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Initial Bid: Enter the bidding at or slightly above the starting price, around $5100 to $5200, to secure the item without significantly overpaying.\n - Monitor Competition: Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other participants, especially Bidder 3, who also showed interest in Machine P.\n - Monitor Bidder 3: Since Bidder 3 has dropped out in the previous rounds, keep a close eye on their bidding behavior in the remaining items. If they start bidding again, reassess the competition and adjust the bidding strategy accordingly.\n - Analyze Competition: Identify items with less competition based on the previous bidding behavior. This can help in securing items with higher profit margins while avoiding unnecessary bidding wars.\n - Gizmo F: Aim to secure this item at the starting price or slightly higher, leaving enough budget for future items with higher profit potential.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $2900\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $2500\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n  * Bidder 4: $8900\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Implement G: $3500\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Doodad D: $2700\n    * Machine P: $7000\n    * Equipment E: $2900\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Initial Bid: Enter the bidding at or slightly above the starting price, around $5100 to $5200, to secure the item without significantly overpaying.\n - Monitor Competition: Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other participants, especially Bidder 3, who also showed interest in Machine P.\n - Monitor Bidder 3: Since Bidder 3 has dropped out in the previous rounds, keep a close eye on their bidding behavior in the remaining items. If they start bidding again, reassess the competition and adjust the bidding strategy accordingly.\n - Analyze Competition: Identify items with less competition based on the previous bidding behavior. This can help in securing items with higher profit margins while avoiding unnecessary bidding wars.\n - Gizmo F: Aim to secure this item at the starting price or slightly higher, leaving enough budget for future items with higher profit potential.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $2900\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $2500\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n  * Bidder 4: $8900\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Implement G: $3500\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Doodad D: $2700\n    * Machine P: $7000\n    * Equipment E: $2900\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Initial Bid: Enter the bidding at or slightly above the starting price, around $5100 to $5200, to secure the item without significantly overpaying.\n - Monitor Competition: Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other participants, especially Bidder 3, who also showed interest in Machine P.\n - Monitor Bidder 3: Since Bidder 3 has dropped out in the previous rounds, keep a close eye on their bidding behavior in the remaining items. If they start bidding again, reassess the competition and adjust the bidding strategy accordingly.\n - Analyze Competition: Identify items with less competition based on the previous bidding behavior. This can help in securing items with higher profit margins while avoiding unnecessary bidding wars.\n - Gizmo F: Aim to secure this item at the starting price or slightly higher, leaving enough budget for future items with higher profit potential.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $2900\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $2500\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n  * Bidder 4: $8900\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Implement G: $3500\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Doodad D: $2700\n    * Machine P: $7000\n    * Equipment E: $2900\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Initial Bid: Enter the bidding at or slightly above the starting price, around $5100 to $5200, to secure the item without significantly overpaying.\n - Monitor Competition: Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other participants, especially Bidder 3, who also showed interest in Machine P.\n - Monitor Bidder 3: Since Bidder 3 has dropped out in the previous rounds, keep a close eye on their bidding behavior in the remaining items. If they start bidding again, reassess the competition and adjust the bidding strategy accordingly.\n - Analyze Competition: Identify items with less competition based on the previous bidding behavior. This can help in securing items with higher profit margins while avoiding unnecessary bidding wars.\n - Gizmo F: Aim to secure this item at the starting price or slightly higher, leaving enough budget for future items with higher profit potential.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $2900\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $2500\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n  * Bidder 4: $8900\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Implement G: $3500\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Doodad D: $2700\n    * Machine P: $7000\n    * Equipment E: $2900\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Initial Bid: Enter the bidding at or slightly above the starting price, around $5100 to $5200, to secure the item without significantly overpaying.\n - Monitor Competition: Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other participants, especially Bidder 3, who also showed interest in Machine P.\n - Monitor Bidder 3: Since Bidder 3 has dropped out in the previous rounds, keep a close eye on their bidding behavior in the remaining items. If they start bidding again, reassess the competition and adjust the bidding strategy accordingly.\n - Analyze Competition: Identify items with less competition based on the previous bidding behavior. This can help in securing items with higher profit margins while avoiding unnecessary bidding wars.\n - Gizmo F: Aim to secure this item at the starting price or slightly higher, leaving enough budget for future items with higher profit potential.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $2900\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $2500\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n  * Bidder 4: $8900\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Implement G: $3500\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Doodad D: $2700\n    * Machine P: $7000\n    * Equipment E: $2900\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

If they consistently drop out early or avoid bidding on certain items, consider adjusting your bidding strategy accordingly.\n - Target Widget A and Thingamajig C: These items have lower starting prices and high estimated value to profit ratios. Securing these items can help increase the total profits and maintain a competitive edge against Bidder 3.\n - Focus on items with higher profit margins: With a remaining budget of $2900, target items with higher estimated values to maximize the potential profit. This includes Widget A, Utensil N, Contraption I, Apparatus H, and Appliance O.\n - Monitor Bidder 3's budget: Keep an eye on Bidder 3's bidding behavior, especially if they start bidding on lower-priced items, as they have a higher remaining budget compared to Bidder 4.\n - Be prepared to adjust the strategy: Continuously monitor the auction dynamics and adjust the strategy accordingly to maximize profit.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $2900\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $2500\n  * Bidder 3: $4000\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Implement G: $3500\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * Element R: $6000\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Doodad D: $2700\n    * Machine P: $7000\n    * Equipment E: $2900\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

This can help in predicting their remaining budget and potential withdrawal from bidding wars.\n - Anticipate Bidder 1's Withdrawal: If Bidder 1 withdraws from bidding wars on items with starting prices close to their remaining budget, anticipate their withdrawal from similar bidding wars in the future.\n - Avoid bidding wars when possible: Since Bidder 4 has already secured the most profitable item (Machine P), it is essential to avoid exhausting the remaining budget in bidding wars, especially with Bidder 1.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $100\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $6000\n  * Bidder 3: $4000\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Implement G: $3500\n    * Utensil N: $4500\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * Element R: $6000\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Doodad D: $2700\n    * Machine P: $7000\n    * Equipment E: $2900\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n    * Widget A: $1200\n    * Thingamajig C: $1600\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.
