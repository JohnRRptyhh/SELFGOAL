Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Review Bid History: Look at the bid history for each item. If the bidding stopped far below your estimation, it might suggest that your estimation was too high. Conversely, if the bidding went significantly above your estimation, consider whether you underestimated the item's value.\n - Factor in Competition: Consider the number and bidding behavior of the other participants. If there are many participants and\/or they are aggressively bidding, you might need to increase your estimations. Conversely, if there are few participants and\/or they are cautious in their bidding, you might be able to lower your estimations.\n - Prioritize High-Value Items: With a good amount of budget left, focus on items with higher estimated values first. This increases the potential for higher profits.\n - Start with Lower Bids: For the next items, start with bids lower than your estimated value, especially for high-value items. This gives you room to increase your bid if necessary, while also potentially saving budget.\n - Focus on High-Value Items: With a budget of $20000, prioritize bidding on items with higher estimated value, such as Appliance O, Utensil N, and Unit Q. This strategy increases the potential for higher profits.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Appliance O:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $4500\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Budget Management: With a remaining budget of $800, it's crucial to be mindful of the budget while bidding on the remaining items.\n - Be prepared to drop out of bidding wars early: With a low remaining budget, it's crucial to avoid overspending and focus on opportunities that provide the best balance between potential profit and risk.\n - Element R: You estimated this at $11000. Given the past overestimation, you might want to adjust this to around $9000 to avoid overpaying.\n - Market Trend Analysis: Analyze the hammer prices of the items won by other bidders. This could provide insights into the current market trends and help you adjust your estimations accordingly.\n - Re-evaluate Risk Tolerance: Given the current state of the auction, you might need to re-evaluate your risk tolerance. It might be more profitable to focus on items with a lower estimated value but also a lower risk of overbidding.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $800\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $4000\n  * Bidder 4: $12800\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Machine P: $6000\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Gadget B: $1500\n    * Appliance O: $4500\n    * Utensil N: $4900\n    * Widget A: $1300\n    * Apparatus H: $3500\n    * Contraption I: $3500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

For example, Element R has the highest estimated value among the remaining items.\n - Analyze competitor behavior: Look at the items won by other bidders. If they've won items with significantly higher hammer prices than their estimated values, they might be overestimating the true values.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Monitor Competition: Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of Bidder 2, who won Thingamajig C. If they show interest in Doodad D, be prepared for a potential bidding war.\n - Contingency Plan: If you decide not to bid on Doodad D due to budget constraints or competition, make sure to have a contingency plan for the final item, Implement G. This could involve starting with a lower bid or waiting to see how the bidding unfolds before deciding to join.\n - Competition Assessment: Evaluate the bidding behavior of other participants, especially Bidder 1 who has a higher total profit. If Bidder 1 shows interest in Doodad D, be prepared to drop out if the bidding price becomes too high.\n - Implement G: {'Your estimated value': '$6600', 'Starting price': '$3000', 'Current highest bid': '$3500 (Apparatus H)', 'Brief guideline': \"Since Apparatus H was bid at $3500, it's possible that Implement G might also start at a similar price. Start with a bid around $3600 and adjust based on competition. Make sure to leave enough budget for potential bidding wars.\"}\n - Monitor the bidding behavior of other participants closely: If they underestimate the value of an item, it could be a good opportunity for you to secure a profit.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Implement G:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3200\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3: $3500\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold! Implement G to Bidder 3 at $3500! The true value for Implement G is $6000.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Implement G. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding. Here's your previous status:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $800\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $4000\n  * Bidder 4: $12800\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Machine P: $6000\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Gadget B: $1500\n    * Appliance O: $4500\n    * Utensil N: $4900\n    * Widget A: $1300\n    * Apparatus H: $3500\n    * Contraption I: $3500\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Thingamajig C: $1100\n    * Doodad D: $2200\n```\n\nSummarize the notable behaviors of all bidders in this round of bidding for future reference. Then, update the status JSON regarding the following information:\n- 'remaining_budget': The remaining budget of you, expressed as a numerical value.\n- 'total_profits': The total profits achieved so far for each bidder, where a numerical value following a bidder's name. No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}. If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"In this round of bidding, Bidder 1 and Bidder 4 initially bid on Implement G, but both eventually withdrew, leaving Bidder 3 as the winner with a bid of $350","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
