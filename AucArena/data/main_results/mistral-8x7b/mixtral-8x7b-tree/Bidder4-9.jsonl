However, Bidder 4 has a remaining budget of $6,300 and a total profit of $8,300. This suggests that Bidder 4 has a significant budget and may be willing to spend more on Gadget B.\n - Balance Aggressiveness and Profitability: While being aggressive in bidding can help secure items, it is essential to maintain a balance between aggressiveness and profitability. Bid confidently but strategically, keeping in mind the ultimate goal of maximizing profit.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Equipment E:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $2500\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3: $2500\n- Bidder 4: $2100\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $2700\n\nRound 2:\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Save your budget for items where you have a better chance of winning.\n - Maintain a balance between risk and reward: Keep in mind the total remaining budget and the total profits accumulated so far.

This information will help in making informed decisions during bidding wars.\n - Stay Flexible: Be prepared to adapt the strategy based on the evolving competition and new information about Bidder 2's behavior.\n - Prioritize items with a higher estimated value: Among the lower-priced items, prioritize those with a higher estimated value, such as Implement G, Contraption I, and Element R.\n - Maintain a balance between profits and remaining budget: Aim to secure profits while also ensuring a sufficient remaining budget for future bidding rounds.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Implement G:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3500\n- Bidder 2: $3200\n- Bidder 3: $3200\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1.

You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Widget A: Given the low starting price of $1000 and your estimated value of $2200, it might be worth placing a bid to win this item, especially if other bidders do not show much interest. Winning Widget A at a reasonable price can contribute to your total profits.\n - Contraption I: With a starting price of $3000 and an estimated value of $6600, this item presents a good opportunity for potential profit.

Since your remaining budget is limited, it would be ideal to win one of these items at a price close to their starting prices. Pay close attention to the bidding patterns of other bidders and only engage in bidding wars if the price remains reasonable.\n - Estimate Bidder 2's Remaining Budget: Based on the items Bidder 2 has won and their respective hammer prices, estimate their remaining budget. For example, subtract the total hammer prices of the items Bidder 2 has won from their initial budget ($20,000).\n - Adjust Bidding Strategy: Based on the comparison of budgets, adjust your bidding strategy. If Bidder 2 has a significantly larger remaining budget, consider being more conservative in your bidding to avoid exhausting your budget too quickly.

Since the starting price is low, there might be a rapid increase in bids, and you don't want to miss the opportunity to place your bid.\n - Avoid Overspending: Ensure that the bid for each item does not exceed the remaining budget minus the estimated value of the subsequent items.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $2300\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $4000\n  * Bidder 4: $10300\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Implement G: $3500\n    * Doodad D: $2500\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Gizmo F: $3000\n    * Utensil N: $4900\n    * Mechanism J: $4600\n    * Gadget B: $1200\n    * Equipment E: $2700\n    * Thingamajig C: $1300\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Identify potential competition: Analyze Bidder 1's bidding pattern to determine if they are a significant competitor for the remaining items.\n - Monitor Bidder 1's budget: Keep track of Bidder 1's remaining budget, as it will impact their bidding behavior in the upcoming rounds.\n - Observe Bidder 1's interest: Pay close attention to Bidder 1's bidding (or lack thereof) on the remaining items, especially Contraption I, as it shares a similar estimated value to the items Bidder 4 has already won.\n - Capitalize on opportunities: If Bidder 1 shows less interest in an item with a reasonable starting price and estimated value, consider placing strategic bids to secure the item at a reasonable price.\n - Analyze the remaining budget and estimated values: With a remaining budget of $700, Bidder 4 should prioritize the items with higher potential profit margins.
