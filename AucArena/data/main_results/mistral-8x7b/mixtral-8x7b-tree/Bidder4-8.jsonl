Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Research recent sales data: Since you have already won the previous item, 'Gizmo F', for a price lower than your estimated value, you can afford to increase your bid for 'Apparatus H'. However, you should still research recent sales data to determine a reasonable bid increment. For instance, you could look at the difference between the starting price and your winning bid for 'Gizmo F' and use that as a guideline for how much to increase your bid for 'Apparatus H'.\n - Identify potential competitors: From the auction log, it appears that Bidder 1, Bidder 2, and Bidder 3 have all dropped out of the bidding for 'Apparatus H'. This suggests that they may have reached their budget limits or were not as interested in this item as you are. However, you should still be cautious and monitor their bidding patterns for any unexpected bids.\n - Consider total profits and winning bids: Based on the auction log, you have a total profit of $3,800 and a remaining budget of $13,800. Bidder 1, Bidder 2, and Bidder 3 have a total profit of $0 and a remaining budget of unknown value. By considering the total profits and winning bids of each competitor, you can estimate their remaining budgets and adjust your bidding strategy accordingly. For example, if you estimate that Bidder 1, Bidder 2, and Bidder 3 have a low remaining budget, you may want to increase your bid for 'Apparatus H' to discourage them from continuing to bid. However, if you estimate that they have a high remaining budget, you may want to be more cautious and avoid overbidding.\n - Estimate the potential profit: Calculate the potential profit for Contraption I by subtracting the starting price from your estimated value: $6600 (estimated value) - $3000 (starting price) = $3600.\n - Assess competition: Analyze the behavior of other bidders in the previous rounds to estimate their strategies and remaining budgets.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Research recent sales data: Since you have already won the previous item, 'Gizmo F', for a price lower than your estimated value, you can afford to increase your bid for 'Apparatus H'. However, you should still research recent sales data to determine a reasonable bid increment. For instance, you could look at the difference between the starting price and your winning bid for 'Gizmo F' and use that as a guideline for how much to increase your bid for 'Apparatus H'.\n - Identify potential competitors: From the auction log, it appears that Bidder 1, Bidder 2, and Bidder 3 have all dropped out of the bidding for 'Apparatus H'. This suggests that they may have reached their budget limits or were not as interested in this item as you are. However, you should still be cautious and monitor their bidding patterns for any unexpected bids.\n - Consider total profits and winning bids: Based on the auction log, you have a total profit of $3,800 and a remaining budget of $13,800. Bidder 1, Bidder 2, and Bidder 3 have a total profit of $0 and a remaining budget of unknown value. By considering the total profits and winning bids of each competitor, you can estimate their remaining budgets and adjust your bidding strategy accordingly. For example, if you estimate that Bidder 1, Bidder 2, and Bidder 3 have a low remaining budget, you may want to increase your bid for 'Apparatus H' to discourage them from continuing to bid. However, if you estimate that they have a high remaining budget, you may want to be more cautious and avoid overbidding.\n - Estimate the potential profit: Calculate the potential profit for Contraption I by subtracting the starting price from your estimated value: $6600 (estimated value) - $3000 (starting price) = $3600.\n - Assess competition: Analyze the behavior of other bidders in the previous rounds to estimate their strategies and remaining budgets.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Research recent sales data: Since you have already won the previous item, 'Gizmo F', for a price lower than your estimated value, you can afford to increase your bid for 'Apparatus H'. However, you should still research recent sales data to determine a reasonable bid increment. For instance, you could look at the difference between the starting price and your winning bid for 'Gizmo F' and use that as a guideline for how much to increase your bid for 'Apparatus H'.\n - Identify potential competitors: From the auction log, it appears that Bidder 1, Bidder 2, and Bidder 3 have all dropped out of the bidding for 'Apparatus H'. This suggests that they may have reached their budget limits or were not as interested in this item as you are. However, you should still be cautious and monitor their bidding patterns for any unexpected bids.\n - Consider total profits and winning bids: Based on the auction log, you have a total profit of $3,800 and a remaining budget of $13,800. Bidder 1, Bidder 2, and Bidder 3 have a total profit of $0 and a remaining budget of unknown value. By considering the total profits and winning bids of each competitor, you can estimate their remaining budgets and adjust your bidding strategy accordingly. For example, if you estimate that Bidder 1, Bidder 2, and Bidder 3 have a low remaining budget, you may want to increase your bid for 'Apparatus H' to discourage them from continuing to bid. However, if you estimate that they have a high remaining budget, you may want to be more cautious and avoid overbidding.\n - Estimate the potential profit: Calculate the potential profit for Contraption I by subtracting the starting price from your estimated value: $6600 (estimated value) - $3000 (starting price) = $3600.\n - Assess competition: Analyze the behavior of other bidders in the previous rounds to estimate their strategies and remaining budgets. This will help you determine how aggressive you should be in bidding for Contraption I.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Thingamajig C:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $1200\n- Bidder 2: $1200\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $1100\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $1300\n\nRound 2:\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Be cautious when bidding on items with higher starting prices: Exercise caution when bidding on items with higher starting prices, as they can quickly deplete a significant portion of your budget.\n - Be prepared to walk away from an item if the bidding price exceeds your estimated value: Be ready to walk away from an item if the bidding price surpasses your estimated value, especially if there are other items with higher profit potential remaining in the auction.\n - Prioritize high-value items: Focus on items with higher estimated values, as they offer a greater potential for profit. For example, Utensil N, Machine P, Element R, and Unit Q have estimated values of $8,800 or higher.\n - Avoid bidding wars for low-value items: Since Bidder 4 has a limited budget, it is crucial to avoid unnecessary bidding wars for items with lower estimated values. This will help preserve the budget for more valuable items.\n - Maintain Caution: Since Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 have not won any items yet, they might be more determined to win in the upcoming rounds. Be cautious with your bidding strategy and avoid overpaying for items.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Widget A:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $1200\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
