Bidding early and often MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew after the first bid, suggesting that they may not have been as committed to the item as Bidder 4.\n2. Bidding aggressively MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to increase their bid by $400 after the initial round of bidding helped them secure the item.\n3. Withdrawing from the auction DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to winning. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew, which ultimately led to Bidder 4 winning the auction.\n4. Monitoring the actions of other bidders MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust one's bidding strategy. If Bidder 4 had not noticed that the other bidders had withdrawn, they may not have increased their bid and could have potentially lost the auction.\n5. Being prepared to walk away from an auction MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overpaying. While Bidder 4 ultimately won the auction, they may have paid more than they were willing to if the other bidders had not withdrawn.\n6. Understanding the value of the item being auctioned MAY BE NECESSARY to determine a bidding strategy. Bidders who are not familiar with the value of the item may be more likely to overpay or withdraw from the auction.\n7. Being patient and waiting for the right opportunity MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to wait until the other bidders withdrew allowed them to secure the item at a lower price than they may have otherwise paid.\n8. Having a clear budget and sticking to it MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overspending. Bidders who have a clear budget in mind are less likely to get caught up in the excitement of the auction and overpay.\n9. Being aware of the auction mechanism and rules MAY BE NECESSARY to participate effectively. Bidders who are not familiar with the auction mechanism or rules may be at a disadvantage and may be more likely to make mistakes.\n10. Being prepared to adjust one's bidding strategy based on new information MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. Bidders who are flexible and willing to adjust their strategy based on new information are more likely to be successful in an auction.\nLearnings:\n-based on the auction log, here are some strategic learnings that could be advantageous for future auctions:\n\n1.

Bidding early and often MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew after the first bid, suggesting that they may not have been as committed to the item as Bidder 4.\n2. Bidding aggressively MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to increase their bid by $400 after the initial round of bidding helped them secure the item.\n3. Withdrawing from the auction DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to winning. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew, which ultimately led to Bidder 4 winning the auction.\n4. Monitoring the actions of other bidders MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust one's bidding strategy. If Bidder 4 had not noticed that the other bidders had withdrawn, they may not have increased their bid and could have potentially lost the auction.\n5. Being prepared to walk away from an auction MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overpaying. While Bidder 4 ultimately won the auction, they may have paid more than they were willing to if the other bidders had not withdrawn.\n6. Understanding the value of the item being auctioned MAY BE NECESSARY to determine a bidding strategy. Bidders who are not familiar with the value of the item may be more likely to overpay or withdraw from the auction.\n7. Being patient and waiting for the right opportunity MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to wait until the other bidders withdrew allowed them to secure the item at a lower price than they may have otherwise paid.\n8. Having a clear budget and sticking to it MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overspending. Bidders who have a clear budget in mind are less likely to get caught up in the excitement of the auction and overpay.\n9. Being aware of the auction mechanism and rules MAY BE NECESSARY to participate effectively. Bidders who are not familiar with the auction mechanism or rules may be at a disadvantage and may be more likely to make mistakes.\n10.

Bidding early and often MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew after the first bid, suggesting that they may not have been as committed to the item as Bidder 4.\n2. Bidding aggressively MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to increase their bid by $400 after the initial round of bidding helped them secure the item.\n3. Withdrawing from the auction DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to winning. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew, which ultimately led to Bidder 4 winning the auction.\n4.

If Bidder 4 had not noticed that the other bidders had withdrawn, they may not have increased their bid and could have potentially lost the auction.\n5. Being prepared to walk away from an auction MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overpaying. While Bidder 4 ultimately won the auction, they may have paid more than they were willing to if the other bidders had not withdrawn.\n6. Understanding the value of the item being auctioned MAY BE NECESSARY to determine a bidding strategy. Bidders who are not familiar with the value of the item may be more likely to overpay or withdraw from the auction.\n7. Being patient and waiting for the right opportunity MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to wait until the other bidders withdrew allowed them to secure the item at a lower price than they may have otherwise paid.\n8.

In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew after the first bid, suggesting that they may not have been as committed to the item as Bidder 4.\n2. Bidding aggressively MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to increase their bid by $400 after the initial round of bidding helped them secure the item.\n3. Withdrawing from the auction DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to winning. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew, which ultimately led to Bidder 4 winning the auction.\n4. Monitoring the actions of other bidders MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust one's bidding strategy. If Bidder 4 had not noticed that the other bidders had withdrawn, they may not have increased their bid and could have potentially lost the auction.\n5. Being prepared to walk away from an auction MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overpaying. While Bidder 4 ultimately won the auction, they may have paid more than they were willing to if the other bidders had not withdrawn.\n6. Understanding the value of the item being auctioned MAY BE NECESSARY to determine a bidding strategy. Bidders who are not familiar with the value of the item may be more likely to overpay or withdraw from the auction.\n7. Being patient and waiting for the right opportunity MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to wait until the other bidders withdrew allowed them to secure the item at a lower price than they may have otherwise paid.\n8. Having a clear budget and sticking to it MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overspending. Bidders who have a clear budget in mind are less likely to get caught up in the excitement of the auction and overpay.\n9. Being aware of the auction mechanism and rules MAY BE NECESSARY to participate effectively. Bidders who are not familiar with the auction mechanism or rules may be at a disadvantage and may be more likely to make mistakes.\n10. Being prepared to adjust one's bidding strategy based on new information MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. Bidders who are flexible and willing to adjust their strategy based on new information are more likely to be successful in an auction.\nLearnings:\n-based on the auction log, here are some strategic learnings that could be advantageous for future auctions:\n\n1.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction. You can use them to guide this auction:\n```\nLearnings:\n-Based on the auction log provided, here are some strategic learnings that could be advantageous for future auctions:\n\n1. Bidding early and often MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew after the first bid, suggesting that they may not have been as committed to the item as Bidder 4.\n2. Bidding aggressively MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to increase their bid by $400 after the initial round of bidding helped them secure the item.\n3. Withdrawing from the auction DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to winning. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew, which ultimately led to Bidder 4 winning the auction.\n4. Monitoring the actions of other bidders MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust one's bidding strategy. If Bidder 4 had not noticed that the other bidders had withdrawn, they may not have increased their bid and could have potentially lost the auction.\n5. Being prepared to walk away from an auction MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overpaying. While Bidder 4 ultimately won the auction, they may have paid more than they were willing to if the other bidders had not withdrawn.\n6. Understanding the value of the item being auctioned MAY BE NECESSARY to determine a bidding strategy. Bidders who are not familiar with the value of the item may be more likely to overpay or withdraw from the auction.\n7. Being patient and waiting for the right opportunity MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to wait until the other bidders withdrew allowed them to secure the item at a lower price than they may have otherwise paid.\n8. Having a clear budget and sticking to it MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overspending. Bidders who have a clear budget in mind are less likely to get caught up in the excitement of the auction and overpay.\n9. Being aware of the auction mechanism and rules MAY BE NECESSARY to participate effectively. Bidders who are not familiar with the auction mechanism or rules may be at a disadvantage and may be more likely to make mistakes.\n10.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction. You can use them to guide this auction:\n```\nLearnings:\n-Based on the auction log provided, here are some strategic learnings that could be advantageous for future auctions:\n\n1. Bidding early and often MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew after the first bid, suggesting that they may not have been as committed to the item as Bidder 4.\n2. Bidding aggressively MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to increase their bid by $400 after the initial round of bidding helped them secure the item.\n3. Withdrawing from the auction DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to winning. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew, which ultimately led to Bidder 4 winning the auction.\n4. Monitoring the actions of other bidders MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust one's bidding strategy. If Bidder 4 had not noticed that the other bidders had withdrawn, they may not have increased their bid and could have potentially lost the auction.\n5. Being prepared to walk away from an auction MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overpaying. While Bidder 4 ultimately won the auction, they may have paid more than they were willing to if the other bidders had not withdrawn.\n6. Understanding the value of the item being auctioned MAY BE NECESSARY to determine a bidding strategy. Bidders who are not familiar with the value of the item may be more likely to overpay or withdraw from the auction.\n7. Being patient and waiting for the right opportunity MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to wait until the other bidders withdrew allowed them to secure the item at a lower price than they may have otherwise paid.\n8. Having a clear budget and sticking to it MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overspending. Bidders who have a clear budget in mind are less likely to get caught up in the excitement of the auction and overpay.\n9. Being aware of the auction mechanism and rules MAY BE NECESSARY to participate effectively. Bidders who are not familiar with the auction mechanism or rules may be at a disadvantage and may be more likely to make mistakes.\n10. Being prepared to adjust one's bidding strategy based on new information MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. Bidders who are flexible and willing to adjust their strategy based on new information are more likely to be successful in an auction.\nLearnings:\n-based on the auction log, here are some strategic learnings that could be advantageous for future auctions:\n\n1.

Bidding early and often MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew after the first bid, suggesting that they may not have been as committed to the item as Bidder 4.\n2. Bidding aggressively MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to increase their bid by $400 after the initial round of bidding helped them secure the item.\n3. Withdrawing from the auction DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to winning. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew, which ultimately led to Bidder 4 winning the auction.\n4. Monitoring the actions of other bidders MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust one's bidding strategy. If Bidder 4 had not noticed that the other bidders had withdrawn, they may not have increased their bid and could have potentially lost the auction.\n5. Being prepared to walk away from an auction MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overpaying. While Bidder 4 ultimately won the auction, they may have paid more than they were willing to if the other bidders had not withdrawn.\n6. Understanding the value of the item being auctioned MAY BE NECESSARY to determine a bidding strategy. Bidders who are not familiar with the value of the item may be more likely to overpay or withdraw from the auction.\n7. Being patient and waiting for the right opportunity MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to wait until the other bidders withdrew allowed them to secure the item at a lower price than they may have otherwise paid.\n8. Having a clear budget and sticking to it MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overspending. Bidders who have a clear budget in mind are less likely to get caught up in the excitement of the auction and overpay.\n9. Being aware of the auction mechanism and rules MAY BE NECESSARY to participate effectively. Bidders who are not familiar with the auction mechanism or rules may be at a disadvantage and may be more likely to make mistakes.\n10. Being prepared to adjust one's bidding strategy based on new information MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. Bidders who are flexible and willing to adjust their strategy based on new information are more likely to be successful in an auction.\nLearnings:\n-based on the auction log, here are some strategic learnings that could be advantageous for future auctions:\n\n1.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction. You can use them to guide this auction:\n```\nLearnings:\n-Based on the auction log provided, here are some strategic learnings that could be advantageous for future auctions:\n\n1. Bidding early and often MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew after the first bid, suggesting that they may not have been as committed to the item as Bidder 4.\n2. Bidding aggressively MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to increase their bid by $400 after the initial round of bidding helped them secure the item.\n3. Withdrawing from the auction DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to winning. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew, which ultimately led to Bidder 4 winning the auction.\n4. Monitoring the actions of other bidders MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust one's bidding strategy. If Bidder 4 had not noticed that the other bidders had withdrawn, they may not have increased their bid and could have potentially lost the auction.\n5. Being prepared to walk away from an auction MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overpaying. While Bidder 4 ultimately won the auction, they may have paid more than they were willing to if the other bidders had not withdrawn.\n6. Understanding the value of the item being auctioned MAY BE NECESSARY to determine a bidding strategy. Bidders who are not familiar with the value of the item may be more likely to overpay or withdraw from the auction.\n7. Being patient and waiting for the right opportunity MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to wait until the other bidders withdrew allowed them to secure the item at a lower price than they may have otherwise paid.\n8. Having a clear budget and sticking to it MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overspending. Bidders who have a clear budget in mind are less likely to get caught up in the excitement of the auction and overpay.\n9.

Bidding early and often MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew after the first bid, suggesting that they may not have been as committed to the item as Bidder 4.\n2. Bidding aggressively MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to increase their bid by $400 after the initial round of bidding helped them secure the item.\n3. Withdrawing from the auction DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to winning. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew, which ultimately led to Bidder 4 winning the auction.\n4.

While Bidder 4 ultimately won the auction, they may have paid more than they were willing to if the other bidders had not withdrawn.\n6.

Bidders who are not familiar with the value of the item may be more likely to overpay or withdraw from the auction.\n7. Being patient and waiting for the right opportunity MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to wait until the other bidders withdrew allowed them to secure the item at a lower price than they may have otherwise paid.\n8.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value.

Bidding early and often MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew after the first bid, suggesting that they may not have been as committed to the item as Bidder 4.\n2. Bidding aggressively MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to increase their bid by $400 after the initial round of bidding helped them secure the item.\n3. Withdrawing from the auction DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to winning. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew, which ultimately led to Bidder 4 winning the auction.\n4. Monitoring the actions of other bidders MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust one's bidding strategy. If Bidder 4 had not noticed that the other bidders had withdrawn, they may not have increased their bid and could have potentially lost the auction.\n5.

Bidding early and often MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew after the first bid, suggesting that they may not have been as committed to the item as Bidder 4.\n2. Bidding aggressively MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to increase their bid by $400 after the initial round of bidding helped them secure the item.\n3. Withdrawing from the auction DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to winning. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew, which ultimately led to Bidder 4 winning the auction.\n4. Monitoring the actions of other bidders MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust one's bidding strategy. If Bidder 4 had not noticed that the other bidders had withdrawn, they may not have increased their bid and could have potentially lost the auction.\n5. Being prepared to walk away from an auction MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overpaying. While Bidder 4 ultimately won the auction, they may have paid more than they were willing to if the other bidders had not withdrawn.\n6. Understanding the value of the item being auctioned MAY BE NECESSARY to determine a bidding strategy. Bidders who are not familiar with the value of the item may be more likely to overpay or withdraw from the auction.\n7. Being patient and waiting for the right opportunity MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to wait until the other bidders withdrew allowed them to secure the item at a lower price than they may have otherwise paid.\n8. Having a clear budget and sticking to it MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overspending. Bidders who have a clear budget in mind are less likely to get caught up in the excitement of the auction and overpay.\n9. Being aware of the auction mechanism and rules MAY BE NECESSARY to participate effectively. Bidders who are not familiar with the auction mechanism or rules may be at a disadvantage and may be more likely to make mistakes.\n10. Being prepared to adjust one's bidding strategy based on new information MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. Bidders who are flexible and willing to adjust their strategy based on new information are more likely to be successful in an auction.\nLearnings:\n-based on the auction log, here are some strategic learnings that could be advantageous for future auctions:\n\n1.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction. You can use them to guide this auction:\n```\nLearnings:\n-Based on the auction log provided, here are some strategic learnings that could be advantageous for future auctions:\n\n1. Bidding early and often MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew after the first bid, suggesting that they may not have been as committed to the item as Bidder 4.\n2. Bidding aggressively MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to increase their bid by $400 after the initial round of bidding helped them secure the item.\n3. Withdrawing from the auction DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to winning. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew, which ultimately led to Bidder 4 winning the auction.\n4. Monitoring the actions of other bidders MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust one's bidding strategy. If Bidder 4 had not noticed that the other bidders had withdrawn, they may not have increased their bid and could have potentially lost the auction.\n5. Being prepared to walk away from an auction MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overpaying. While Bidder 4 ultimately won the auction, they may have paid more than they were willing to if the other bidders had not withdrawn.\n6. Understanding the value of the item being auctioned MAY BE NECESSARY to determine a bidding strategy. Bidders who are not familiar with the value of the item may be more likely to overpay or withdraw from the auction.\n7. Being patient and waiting for the right opportunity MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to wait until the other bidders withdrew allowed them to secure the item at a lower price than they may have otherwise paid.\n8. Having a clear budget and sticking to it MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overspending. Bidders who have a clear budget in mind are less likely to get caught up in the excitement of the auction and overpay.\n9. Being aware of the auction mechanism and rules MAY BE NECESSARY to participate effectively. Bidders who are not familiar with the auction mechanism or rules may be at a disadvantage and may be more likely to make mistakes.\n10.

Items with a lower estimated value compared to their starting price or potential competition are assigned a priority of 2 or 1.\n\nSince Bidder 1 has won Implement G and Bidder 4 has won Mechanism J, Utensil N, Gadget B, Doodad D, and Element R, Bidder 4 should focus on the remaining items with higher estimated values and less competition. However, with a remaining budget of only $100, the bidder should be cautious and avoid overbidding.\n\nBased on the current status, Bidder 4 should prioritize Appliance O and Unit Q, as they have the highest estimated values and less competition. However, with a remaining budget of only $100, it may not be feasible to win any of these items.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction.

Bidding early and often MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew after the first bid, suggesting that they may not have been as committed to the item as Bidder 4.\n2. Bidding aggressively MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to increase their bid by $400 after the initial round of bidding helped them secure the item.\n3. Withdrawing from the auction DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to winning. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew, which ultimately led to Bidder 4 winning the auction.\n4. Monitoring the actions of other bidders MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust one's bidding strategy. If Bidder 4 had not noticed that the other bidders had withdrawn, they may not have increased their bid and could have potentially lost the auction.\n5. Being prepared to walk away from an auction MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overpaying. While Bidder 4 ultimately won the auction, they may have paid more than they were willing to if the other bidders had not withdrawn.\n6.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction. You can use them to guide this auction:\n```\nLearnings:\n-Based on the auction log provided, here are some strategic learnings that could be advantageous for future auctions:\n\n1. Bidding early and often MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew after the first bid, suggesting that they may not have been as committed to the item as Bidder 4.\n2. Bidding aggressively MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to increase their bid by $400 after the initial round of bidding helped them secure the item.\n3. Withdrawing from the auction DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to winning. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew, which ultimately led to Bidder 4 winning the auction.\n4. Monitoring the actions of other bidders MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust one's bidding strategy. If Bidder 4 had not noticed that the other bidders had withdrawn, they may not have increased their bid and could have potentially lost the auction.\n5. Being prepared to walk away from an auction MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overpaying. While Bidder 4 ultimately won the auction, they may have paid more than they were willing to if the other bidders had not withdrawn.\n6. Understanding the value of the item being auctioned MAY BE NECESSARY to determine a bidding strategy. Bidders who are not familiar with the value of the item may be more likely to overpay or withdraw from the auction.\n7. Being patient and waiting for the right opportunity MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to wait until the other bidders withdrew allowed them to secure the item at a lower price than they may have otherwise paid.\n8. Having a clear budget and sticking to it MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overspending. Bidders who have a clear budget in mind are less likely to get caught up in the excitement of the auction and overpay.\n9. Being aware of the auction mechanism and rules MAY BE NECESSARY to participate effectively. Bidders who are not familiar with the auction mechanism or rules may be at a disadvantage and may be more likely to make mistakes.\n10. Being prepared to adjust one's bidding strategy based on new information MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. Bidders who are flexible and willing to adjust their strategy based on new information are more likely to be successful in an auction.\nLearnings:\n-based on the auction log, here are some strategic learnings that could be advantageous for future auctions:\n\n1.

Bidding early and often MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew after the first bid, suggesting that they may not have been as committed to the item as Bidder 4.\n2. Bidding aggressively MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to increase their bid by $400 after the initial round of bidding helped them secure the item.\n3. Withdrawing from the auction DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to winning. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew, which ultimately led to Bidder 4 winning the auction.\n4. Monitoring the actions of other bidders MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust one's bidding strategy. If Bidder 4 had not noticed that the other bidders had withdrawn, they may not have increased their bid and could have potentially lost the auction.\n5. Being prepared to walk away from an auction MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overpaying. While Bidder 4 ultimately won the auction, they may have paid more than they were willing to if the other bidders had not withdrawn.\n6. Understanding the value of the item being auctioned MAY BE NECESSARY to determine a bidding strategy. Bidders who are not familiar with the value of the item may be more likely to overpay or withdraw from the auction.\n7. Being patient and waiting for the right opportunity MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to wait until the other bidders withdrew allowed them to secure the item at a lower price than they may have otherwise paid.\n8. Having a clear budget and sticking to it MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overspending. Bidders who have a clear budget in mind are less likely to get caught up in the excitement of the auction and overpay.\n9.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction. You can use them to guide this auction:\n```\nLearnings:\n-Based on the auction log provided, here are some strategic learnings that could be advantageous for future auctions:\n\n1. Bidding early and often MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew after the first bid, suggesting that they may not have been as committed to the item as Bidder 4.\n2. Bidding aggressively MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to increase their bid by $400 after the initial round of bidding helped them secure the item.\n3. Withdrawing from the auction DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to winning. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew, which ultimately led to Bidder 4 winning the auction.\n4. Monitoring the actions of other bidders MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust one's bidding strategy. If Bidder 4 had not noticed that the other bidders had withdrawn, they may not have increased their bid and could have potentially lost the auction.\n5. Being prepared to walk away from an auction MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overpaying. While Bidder 4 ultimately won the auction, they may have paid more than they were willing to if the other bidders had not withdrawn.\n6. Understanding the value of the item being auctioned MAY BE NECESSARY to determine a bidding strategy. Bidders who are not familiar with the value of the item may be more likely to overpay or withdraw from the auction.\n7. Being patient and waiting for the right opportunity MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to wait until the other bidders withdrew allowed them to secure the item at a lower price than they may have otherwise paid.\n8. Having a clear budget and sticking to it MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overspending. Bidders who have a clear budget in mind are less likely to get caught up in the excitement of the auction and overpay.\n9. Being aware of the auction mechanism and rules MAY BE NECESSARY to participate effectively. Bidders who are not familiar with the auction mechanism or rules may be at a disadvantage and may be more likely to make mistakes.\n10. Being prepared to adjust one's bidding strategy based on new information MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. Bidders who are flexible and willing to adjust their strategy based on new information are more likely to be successful in an auction.\nLearnings:\n-based on the auction log, here are some strategic learnings that could be advantageous for future auctions:\n\n1.

However, with a remaining budget of only $100, the bidder should be cautious and avoid overbidding.\n\nBased on the current status, Bidder 4 should prioritize Thingamajig C, as it has a higher estimated value compared to its starting price and less competition. However, with a remaining budget of only $100, it may not be feasible to win this item. Bidder 4 should monitor the auction closely and be prepared to adjust their strategy based on new information.\n\nGiven the low remaining budget, Bidder 4 should consider saving their budget for future auctions or bidding on lower-priced items with less competition. In this case, Apparatus H is the only item with a priority of 1, as it has a lower estimated value compared to its starting price and potential competition. Bidder 4 should monitor the auction closely and be prepared to adjust their strategy based on new information.\n\nIt is important to note that with a remaining budget of only $100, Bidder 4 may not be able to win any more items in this auction. Therefore, the bidder should consider their options carefully and make strategic decisions to maximize their profits.\n\nIn summary, Bidder 4 should prioritize Thingamajig C and monitor the auction closely to adjust their strategy based on new information. With a remaining budget of only $100, Bidder 4 should be cautious and avoid overbidding. The bidder should also consider saving their budget for future auctions or bidding on lower-priced items with less competition.","tag":"plan_13"},{"messages":[{"system":"You are Bidder 4, who is attending an ascending-bid auction as a bidder.

Bidding early and often MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew after the first bid, suggesting that they may not have been as committed to the item as Bidder 4.\n2. Bidding aggressively MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to increase their bid by $400 after the initial round of bidding helped them secure the item.\n3. Withdrawing from the auction DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to winning. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew, which ultimately led to Bidder 4 winning the auction.\n4. Monitoring the actions of other bidders MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust one's bidding strategy. If Bidder 4 had not noticed that the other bidders had withdrawn, they may not have increased their bid and could have potentially lost the auction.\n5. Being prepared to walk away from an auction MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overpaying. While Bidder 4 ultimately won the auction, they may have paid more than they were willing to if the other bidders had not withdrawn.\n6. Understanding the value of the item being auctioned MAY BE NECESSARY to determine a bidding strategy. Bidders who are not familiar with the value of the item may be more likely to overpay or withdraw from the auction.\n7. Being patient and waiting for the right opportunity MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to wait until the other bidders withdrew allowed them to secure the item at a lower price than they may have otherwise paid.\n8. Having a clear budget and sticking to it MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overspending. Bidders who have a clear budget in mind are less likely to get caught up in the excitement of the auction and overpay.\n9. Being aware of the auction mechanism and rules MAY BE NECESSARY to participate effectively. Bidders who are not familiar with the auction mechanism or rules may be at a disadvantage and may be more likely to make mistakes.\n10. Being prepared to adjust one's bidding strategy based on new information MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. Bidders who are flexible and willing to adjust their strategy based on new information are more likely to be successful in an auction.\nLearnings:\n-based on the auction log, here are some strategic learnings that could be advantageous for future auctions:\n\n1.

Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value.

Bidding early and often MAY BE NECESSARY to remain competitive in an auction. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew after the first bid, suggesting that they may not have been as committed to the item as Bidder 4.\n2. Bidding aggressively MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to increase their bid by $400 after the initial round of bidding helped them secure the item.\n3. Withdrawing from the auction DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to winning. In this example, all bidders except Bidder 4 withdrew, which ultimately led to Bidder 4 winning the auction.\n4. Monitoring the actions of other bidders MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust one's bidding strategy. If Bidder 4 had not noticed that the other bidders had withdrawn, they may not have increased their bid and could have potentially lost the auction.\n5. Being prepared to walk away from an auction MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overpaying. While Bidder 4 ultimately won the auction, they may have paid more than they were willing to if the other bidders had not withdrawn.\n6. Understanding the value of the item being auctioned MAY BE NECESSARY to determine a bidding strategy. Bidders who are not familiar with the value of the item may be more likely to overpay or withdraw from the auction.\n7. Being patient and waiting for the right opportunity MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Bidder 4's willingness to wait until the other bidders withdrew allowed them to secure the item at a lower price than they may have otherwise paid.\n8. Having a clear budget and sticking to it MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overspending. Bidders who have a clear budget in mind are less likely to get caught up in the excitement of the auction and overpay.\n9. Being aware of the auction mechanism and rules MAY BE NECESSARY to participate effectively. Bidders who are not familiar with the auction mechanism or rules may be at a disadvantage and may be more likely to make mistakes.\n10.

Apparatus H to Bidder 2 at $4000! The true value for Apparatus H is $6000.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Apparatus H. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding. Here's your previous status:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $100\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $2800\n  * Bidder 2: $3200\n  * Bidder 4: $12100\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Implement G: $3200\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Contraption I: $3500\n    * Thingamajig C: $1300\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Mechanism J: $4900\n    * Utensil N: $5300\n    * Gadget B: $1000\n    * Doodad D: $2700\n    * Element R: $6000\n```\n\nSummarize the notable behaviors of all bidders in this round of bidding for future reference. Then, update the status JSON regarding the following information:\n- 'remaining_budget': The remaining budget of you, expressed as a numerical value.\n- 'total_profits': The total profits achieved so far for each bidder, where a numerical value following a bidder's name. No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}. If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Summary of notable behaviors in this round of bidding:\n\n* Bidder 1 and Bidder 3 withdrew from the bidding war for Apparatus H, indicating that they may have overestimated its value or reached their budget limit.\n* Bidder 2 won the item at $4000, which is $2000 below its true value of $6000. This suggests that Bidder 2 may have underestimated the value of Apparatus H or was not aware of its true value.\n\nUpdated status JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 100,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 2800,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 3500,\n    \"Bidder 4\": 12100\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Implement G\": 3200\n    },\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\n      \"Contraption I\": 3500,\n      \"Thingamajig C\": 1300\n    },\n    \"Bidder 4\": {\n      \"Mechanism J\": 4900,\n      \"Utensil N\": 5300,\n      \"Gadget B\": 1000,\n      \"Doodad D\": 2700,\n      \"Element R\": 6000\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nNote: Bidder 4 is not mentioned in the given text, so their information remains unchanged.","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
