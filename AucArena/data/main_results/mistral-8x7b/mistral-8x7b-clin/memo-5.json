Starting price MAY BE NECESSARY to attract initial bidders. In this case, the starting price of $5000 for Machine P may have been attractive enough for Bidders 1, 2, 3, and 4 to place their first bids.\n2. Competition MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to increasing the final price. Here, the presence of multiple bidders (Bidders 1, 2, 3, and 4) competing for Machine P may have contributed to the final price of $6000.\n3. Withdrawal of bidders MAY BE NECESSARY to determine the final price. In this case, the withdrawal of Bidders 1, 3, and 4 left Bidder 2 as the sole bidder, resulting in a final price of $6000.\n4. A single bidder MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to setting the final price. Here, Bidder 2 was the last bidder remaining and set the final price of $6000.\n5. A higher starting price MAY NOT CONTRIBUTE to a higher final price. Although the starting price of $5000 was attractive enough to draw initial bids, it did not necessarily lead to a higher final price.\n6. Aggressive bidding MAY NOT ALWAYS LEAD to winning the auction. Here, Bidders 1, 3, and 4 all withdrew despite placing higher bids than Bidder 2.\n7. Persistence MAY BE NECESSARY to win the auction. Here, Bidder 2 was the only bidder who did not withdraw and ultimately won the auction.\n8. Monitoring the competition MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning the auction. Here, Bidder 2 may have monitored the competition and adjusted their bidding strategy accordingly, ultimately leading to a win.\n9. A higher number of bidders MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to a higher final price. Here, the presence of multiple bidders (Bidders 1, 2, 3, and 4) may have contributed to the final price of $6000.\n10. A lower number of bidders MAY NOT NECESSARILY LEAD to a lower final price. Here, the withdrawal of Bidders 1, 3, and 4 did not necessarily lead to a lower final price, as Bidder 2 was still willing to pay $6000 for Machine P.\nLearnings:\n-Here are the strategic learnings from the past auction log:\n\n1.
