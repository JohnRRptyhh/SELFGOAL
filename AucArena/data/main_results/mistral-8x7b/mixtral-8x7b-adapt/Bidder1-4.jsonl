If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Based on the bidding history, Bidder 1 and Bidder 3 were the only active bidders in the auction for Appliance O. Both bidders bid $5000, but ultimately, no one won the item as both bidders withdrew in the next round.\n\nHere's the updated status JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 14200,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 4200,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 2500\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Utensil N\": 4500,\n      \"Thingamajig C\": 1300\n    },\n    \"Bidder 3\": {\n      \"Implement G\": 3500\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
