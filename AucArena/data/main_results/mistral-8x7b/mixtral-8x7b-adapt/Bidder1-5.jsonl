The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Strategic bidding: Use the analysis of previous winning bids to inform your bidding strategy for the remaining items. Aim to win items at a price that maximizes the profit margin, taking into account the potential for overestimation or underestimation in estimations.\n - Adjust estimated values: Based on the winning bids of other bidders, reassess the estimated values of the remaining items. Consider whether the winning bids align with your initial estimations and adjust accordingly.\n - Evaluate the difference between the true value and the winning bid for each item: Identify potential patterns or trends to understand the market's perception of item values and adjust estimated values accordingly.\n - Identify the items where the winning bid was significantly lower or higher than the true value: Gain insights into the behavior of other bidders and potential opportunities for maximizing profit in future auctions.\n - Monitor competition: Keep a close eye on the bidding behavior of other bidders, especially for Mechanism J and Machine P. Adjust your bidding strategy based on their actions to maximize the chances of winning these high-value items.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $6500\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $10500\n  * Bidder 2: $4000\n  * Bidder 3: $7900\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Contraption I: $3500\n    * Element R: $5500\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Doodad D: $2500\n    * Implement G: $3500\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * Unit Q: $6500\n    * Utensil N: $4500\n    * Gadget B: $1100\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.
