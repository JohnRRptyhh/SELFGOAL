This will help me achieve my primary objective of securing the highest profit at the end of the auction.\n\nIt is also worth noting that I have won five items so far, including Doodad D, Gizmo F, Contraption I, Unit Q, and Implement G. These items have a high potential for profit, and I have already secured a significant amount of profits from them. This means that I am currently in a strong position in the auction, and I should aim to maintain this advantage by focusing on the items with the highest potential for profit and being cautious with my remaining budget.\n\nFurthermore, I will keep an eye on the bidding behavior of Bidder 1 and Bidder 3. If either of them starts bidding aggressively on any of the remaining items, I may need to adjust my bidding strategy accordingly to ensure that I can still secure the highest profit at the end of the auction.\n\nAdditionally, I will consider the remaining budget of Bidder 1 and Bidder 3, which is $3,000 and $4,100, respectively. If either of them has a low remaining budget, I may consider bidding more aggressively on the items with priority level 2 to secure more profits and maintain my advantage in the auction. However, if either of them has a high remaining budget, I may need to be more cautious with my bidding strategy to avoid overbidding and reducing my potential profits.\n\nMoreover, I will consider the starting price of each item and the intensity of the bidding wars for each item. If the starting price of an item is high and there are many bidders interested in it, I may need to be more cautious with my bidding strategy to avoid overbidding and reducing my potential profits. On the other hand, if the starting price of an item is low and there are few bidders interested in it, I may consider bidding more aggressively to secure the item at a lower price and increase my potential profits.\n\nFinally, I will consider the time remaining in the auction and the number of items left to be auctioned. If there are many items left to be auctioned and there is still a lot of time remaining, I may consider bidding more aggressively on the items with priority level 2 to secure more profits and maintain my advantage in the auction. However, if there are few items left to be auctioned and there is little time remaining, I may need to be more cautious with my bidding strategy to avoid overbidding and reducing my potential profits."},{"human":"Now, the auctioneer says: \"Attention, bidders! 1 item(s) left, they are: Utensil N.\n\nNow, please bid on Utensil N.
