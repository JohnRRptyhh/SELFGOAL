Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1.

However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Budget management: Ensure that you have enough funds reserved for bidding on the remaining higher-value items, while also considering the potential competition from other bidders.\n - Risk assessment: Evaluate the potential profit margins for each item and consider the level of risk associated with each bid. This involves weighing the potential profit against the likelihood of winning the item at a favorable price.\n - Assess competition: Evaluate the behavior and budget of the other bidders. If they have a higher budget or have been aggressive in previous bids, consider adjusting your bidding strategy accordingly.\n - Monitor the auction progress: Keep track of the remaining items and their starting prices to plan your bidding strategy for upcoming rounds.\n - Long-term profitability: Keep in mind the overall goal of maximizing profit throughout the entire auction. Prioritize items with higher estimated values and potential for greater profit margins while maintaining a balanced approach to budget allocation.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $20000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * No winning bids\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Prioritize higher-value items: Focus on allocating a larger portion of your budget to items with higher estimated values, such as Unit Q, Element R, and Machine P, to potentially secure higher profits.\n - Consider Market Trends: Take into account any market trends or external factors that may influence the true value of the remaining items. This could include the popularity of certain items, seasonal demand, or any specific features that might affect their resale value.\n - Adjust estimated values: Reassess the estimated values of the remaining items based on the behavior and budget of the other bidders. If the competition is fierce, consider adjusting your estimated values to be more conservative to avoid overbidding.\n - Budget allocation: Consider reallocating your budget for the remaining items based on the competition. If the competition is strong, prioritize items with higher profit potential and be prepared to adjust your budget allocation accordingly.\n - Timing of bids: Strategically time your bids to gauge the competition and avoid unnecessarily driving up the price. Consider holding back to secure items at the lowest possible price when competition is low.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Contraption I:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3500\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
