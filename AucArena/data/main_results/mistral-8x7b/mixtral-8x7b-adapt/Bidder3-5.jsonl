Prioritize items with higher profit potential and adjust your bidding strategy to maximize profit within the budget constraints.\n - Assess remaining competition: Evaluate the behavior and budget allocation of other bidders to determine the level of competition for the remaining items.

However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Consider competition: Take into account the behavior of other bidders and their potential interest in the remaining items. Be prepared to strategically outbid them for high-value items while also considering the risk and potential profit.\n - Maximize profit margin: Aim to secure items with the potential for the highest profit margin based on the difference between your estimated value and the starting price. This may involve being selective and focusing on items that align with the goal of maximizing profit.\n - Anticipate bidding patterns: Anticipate the bidding patterns of other bidders based on their previous behavior and adjust your bidding strategy accordingly. This may involve being more aggressive in bidding for items with lower potential competition and being strategic in conserving budget for items with higher competition.\n - Monitor true values: Continuously reassess your estimated values for the remaining items and consider any new information that may affect their true value. This will help in making informed decisions about budget allocation.\n - Risk assessment: Assess the risk associated with each item and balance it with the potential profit. Consider the behavior of other bidders and the likelihood of winning the item at a favorable price.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $9000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $2500\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $7000\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Contraption I: $3500\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * Utensil N: $4500\n    * Unit Q: $6500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Based on the bidding history, Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 both started with a bid of $4000 for Apparatus H, but Bidder 1 withdrew in Round 1, leaving Bidder 3 as the winner with a final bid of $7000. The true value for Apparatus H is $6000.\n\nHere's the updated status JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 900,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 10500,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 4000,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 900\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Contraption I\": 3500,\n      \"Element R\": 5500,\n      \"Mechanism J\": 4500\n    },\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\n      \"Doodad D\": 2500,\n      \"Implement G\": 3500\n    },\n    \"Bidder 3\": {\n      \"Utensil N\": 4500,\n      \"Unit Q\": 6500,\n      \"Gadget B\": 1100,\n      \"Apparatus H\": 7000\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
