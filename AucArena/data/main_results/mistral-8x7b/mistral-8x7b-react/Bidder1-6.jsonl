If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Based on the bidding history, here's a summary of the notable behaviors of all bidders in this round:\n\n- Bidder 1 initially bid $3500 but withdrew in Round 1.\n- Bidder 2 initially bid $3500 but withdrew in Round 1.\n- Bidder 3 won Implement G at a bid of $4000.\n\nNow, let's update the status JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 4000,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 8000,\n    \"Bidder 4\": 13450,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 2000\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Unit Q\": 6000,\n      \"Element R\": 6000\n    },\n    \"Bidder 4\": {\n      \"Gadget B\": 1300,\n      \"Appliance O\": 4100,\n      \"Utensil N\": 4000,\n      \"Widget A\": 1300,\n      \"Apparatus H\": 3850,\n      \"Equipment E\": 2700,\n      \"Thingamajig C\": 1300\n    },\n    \"Bidder 3\": {\n      \"Implement G\": 4000\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
