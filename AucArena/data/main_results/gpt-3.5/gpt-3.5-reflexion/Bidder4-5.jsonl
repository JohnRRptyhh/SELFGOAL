No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}. If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction. You can use them to guide this auction:\n```\nReflections:\n-It seems that the auction failed due to a lack of clear rules or guidelines for bidding. The bidders may have been confused about the process, leading to multiple bidders placing the same bid and ultimately withdrawing. To mitigate this issue, a new plan could include clearly outlining the bidding process and rules before the auction begins, ensuring that all bidders understand how to place their bids and avoid confusion. Additionally, implementing a system to prevent multiple bidders from placing the same bid could help streamline the process and prevent misunderstandings.\nReflections:\n-The auction for Machine P failed to generate competitive bidding, possibly due to the starting price being too high. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve conducting market research to determine a more appropriate starting price for the item, as well as implementing a marketing strategy to attract more potential bidders. Additionally, providing more detailed information about the item's value and uniqueness could also help generate more interest and competitive bidding.\nReflections:\n-It seems that the auction for Doodad D did not result in any bids, possibly due to lack of interest or unclear value proposition. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve better marketing and promotion of the item to generate more interest, as well as providing clearer information about the value and potential benefits of acquiring Doodad D. Additionally, offering incentives or discounts for early bidders could also help generate more interest and participation in the auction.\nReflections:\n-It seems that there was a lack of clear communication or understanding of the bidding process, leading to confusion and withdrawal of bidders.

Finally, offering a preview or exhibition of the items before the auction could generate more interest and higher bids.\nReflections:\n-The auction seems to have experienced a lack of competitive bidding, with many bidders withdrawing early on in the process. This could be due to a lack of clear communication about the value of the items being auctioned, leading to uncertainty and hesitation among potential bidders. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve providing more detailed information about the items up for auction, including their true value and potential uses, to encourage more active and informed participation from bidders. Additionally, setting a minimum bid increment could help maintain competitive bidding and prevent early withdrawals.\nReflections:\n-It seems that there was a lack of clear communication or understanding of the bidding process, leading to confusion and withdrawal of bidders.
