If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Based on the bidding history, Bidder 3 and Bidder 4 both bid $1500 for Gadget B, causing all bidders to withdraw from the bidding. As a result, the auctioneer moved on to the next item.\n\nHere's the updated status:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 5300,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 3\": 11300,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 2500\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 3\": {\n      \"Element R\": 5500,\n      \"Apparatus H\": 3200,\n      \"Unit Q\": 6000\n    },\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\n      \"Implement G\": 3500\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
