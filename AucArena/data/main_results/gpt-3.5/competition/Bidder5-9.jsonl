This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Consider the starting prices and estimated values of the remaining items: Compare them to the bidding activity for similar items in previous rounds to gauge potential demand.\n - Keep track of the remaining budget and allocate funds strategically to focus on items with higher demand: Maximizing the potential for winning bids and increasing profits.\n - Stay adaptable and be prepared to adjust bidding strategies based on the observed demand for specific items in the auction: Flexibility is key to capitalizing on the demand for certain types of items.\n - Evaluate the relationship between the starting price of an item and the final winning bid to determine if there are any predictable patterns in the bidding behavior of other participants: Assess the relationship between the starting price of an item and the final winning bid to identify any predictable patterns in the bidding behavior of other participants. This analysis can reveal tendencies in how other bidders respond to the initial pricing and inform adjustments to bidding strategies.\n - Manage budget effectively: Ensure enough funds are available for bidding on high-value items with a higher estimated value later in the auction.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $20000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 5: $0\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 5:\n    * No winning bids\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.
