Items with higher demand or unique features may warrant an adjustment in their estimated values.\n - Adjust bidding strategy: Based on the previous bids and the true value of the items, adjust the bidding strategy to secure items at the lowest possible cost while staying within budget constraints.\n - Flexibility: Be prepared to adapt your bidding strategy based on the behavior of other bidders and the progress of the auction. If an item is consistently going above your estimated value, consider adjusting your strategy for similar items in the future.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Widget A:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $1100\n- Bidder 2: $1100\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n- Bidder 5 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1: $1200\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n\nRound 2:\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
