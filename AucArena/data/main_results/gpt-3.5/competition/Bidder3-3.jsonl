Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget."},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Gadget B:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $1100\n- Bidder 3: $1200\n- Bidder 4: $1200\n- Bidder 5: $1200\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n- Bidder 5 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Gadget B, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Gadget B. \nAs Bidder 3, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction. You can use them to guide this auction:\n```\nReflections:\n-It seems that the auction failed due to a lack of clear rules or guidelines for bidding.

To mitigate this failure, a new, concise, high-level plan could include clearly outlining the bidding process, setting specific rules for increments, and ensuring that all bidders are aware of the guidelines before the auction begins. Additionally, implementing a system to prevent multiple bidders from offering the same amount could help streamline the process and avoid confusion.\nReflections:\n-It seems that the main issue in this auction was the lack of clear communication or understanding of the bidding process, leading to confusion and ultimately no successful bids. To mitigate this, a new plan could include providing clear and concise instructions on the bidding process, ensuring that all bidders are aware of the rules and procedures before the auction begins. Additionally, implementing a system for verifying bids and ensuring that all bidders are actively participating could help prevent misunderstandings and improve the overall success of the auction.\nReflections:\n-It seems that the auction failed to attract enough competitive bidding, possibly due to the starting prices being too high or the items not being attractive enough to the bidders.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction.
