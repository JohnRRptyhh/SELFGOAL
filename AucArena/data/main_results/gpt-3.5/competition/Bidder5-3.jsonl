Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Prioritize high-value items: Focus on winning high-value items such as Element R, Unit Q, and Machine P, as they have the potential to yield a higher profit margin based on your estimated values.\n - Adapt bidding strategy: Adjust your bidding strategy based on the behavior of other bidders and the availability of remaining high-value items to maximize your chances of winning and securing a higher profit.\n - Calculate potential profit margin: Evaluate the potential profit margin for each remaining lower-priced item by subtracting the starting price from your estimated value. This will help you prioritize which items have the highest potential for profit.\n - Assess remaining budget: Evaluate the remaining budget and allocate it strategically to maximize potential profit from winning the remaining items.\n - Identify high-value items: Identify the items with the highest potential resale value based on your estimated values and market demand. Focus on winning these items at a reasonable bid to maximize your profit.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $20000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n  * Bidder 5: $0\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 5:\n    * No winning bids\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Assess remaining budget: Evaluate your remaining budget of $13500 and allocate it strategically to maximize your chances of winning high-value items while still ensuring a profitable resale value.\n - Prioritize high-value items: Focus on winning items with higher estimated values, such as Appliance O, Machine P, and Mechanism J, to maximize potential profits.\n - Consider budget allocation: Evaluate the potential profit margin in relation to your remaining budget. Prioritize bidding on items that offer a good profit margin while still allowing you to stay within your budget constraints.\n - Track remaining bidders: Keep track of the remaining bidders and their budget levels. If some bidders have significantly lower budgets remaining, you may have an opportunity to outbid them for the remaining items and secure them at a lower cost.\n - Risk assessment: Continuously evaluate the potential risks and rewards of bidding on each item, considering the potential deviation of your estimated value from the true value. Adjust your bidding strategy to mitigate risks and secure profitable wins.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $13500\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 5: $3500\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 5:\n    * Unit Q: $6500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.
