Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1.

However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Consider resale value: Take into account the potential resale value of each item when deciding on your bidding strategy. Items with higher resale values should be prioritized, even if they require a larger initial investment.\n - Assess remaining budget: Evaluate your remaining budget of $17500 and consider how to strategically allocate it across the remaining items. Prioritize items with the potential for high profits based on your estimated values.\n - Consider previous profits: Take into account the profits you have already secured from winning bids. Use this information to guide your future bidding strategy and ensure that you continue to maximize profits.\n - Risk management: Assess the potential risks associated with each item and make decisions that minimize potential losses while maximizing potential profits. Consider the difference between your estimated value and the starting price of each item.\n - Adjust estimated values: Reassess your estimated values for the remaining items based on the profitability of the Equipment E item. Consider adjusting your estimates to better align with the potential true values of the items, taking into account any potential overestimation or underestimation.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $17500\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 5: $1500\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 5:\n    * Equipment E: $2500\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Unit Q: $6000\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.
