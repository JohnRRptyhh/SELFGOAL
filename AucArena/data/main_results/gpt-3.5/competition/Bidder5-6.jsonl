Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Strategic Withdrawal: If an item's bidding price exceeds its estimated value, consider withdrawing from the bidding to conserve your budget for more profitable opportunities.\n - Adapt to Competition: Be prepared to adapt your bidding strategy based on the actions of other participants. If certain bidders consistently outbid you, consider adjusting your approach for future items.\n - Prioritize high-value items: Focus on winning items with a high estimated value compared to their starting price. Items such as Machine P, Unit Q, Mechanism J, Appliance O, Utensil N, and Element R have high estimated values, so consider prioritizing these in the remaining rounds.\n - Avoid overbidding: Given that your total profit so far is $800, it's important to avoid overbidding and ensure that you win items at a price that allows for a high profit margin. Be mindful of the true value of the items and bid strategically.\n - Assess the remaining budget: Evaluate the remaining budget of $18800 and distribute it strategically across the remaining items. Consider allocating more budget towards items with higher potential profit margins based on your estimated values.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $15300\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 5: $3300\n  * Bidder 2: $3500\n  * Bidder 4: $3500\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 5:\n    * Thingamajig C: $1200\n    * Apparatus H: $3500\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Appliance O: $4500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.
