Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction. You can use them to guide this auction:\n```\nLearnings:\n-1. Setting a higher starting bid MAY BE NECESSARY to attract serious bidders and discourage low-ball offers.\n2. Implementing a minimum bid increment MAY BE NECESSARY to prevent bidding wars and encourage fair competition.\n3. Providing clear and transparent rules for bidding and withdrawal MAY CONTRIBUTE to a smoother auction process and reduce confusion and frustration for participants.\n4. Establishing a clear communication channel for bidders to ask questions and seek clarification MAY CONTRIBUTE to a more informed and engaged pool of participants.\nLearnings:\n-1.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value.
