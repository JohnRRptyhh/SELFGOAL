If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Based on the bidding history, here's the summary of the notable behaviors of the bidders:\n\n- Bidder 1: Bid $3500 on Implement G but withdrew in Round 1.\n- Bidder 2: Bid $3500 on Implement G but withdrew in Round 1.\n- Bidder 3: Withdrew in Round 0.\n- Bidder 4: Bid $3500 on Implement G but withdrew in Round 1.\n\nNow, let's update the status JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 18800,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 800,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 11000\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Gadget B\": 1200\n    },\n    \"Bidder 3\": {\n      \"Mechanism J\": 4500,\n      \"Machine P\": 6500,\n      \"Element R\": 6000\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
