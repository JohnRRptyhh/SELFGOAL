If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Based on the bidding history, Bidder 1 and Bidder 4 both bid $1500 for Gadget B, while Bidder 2 and Bidder 3 bid $1200. In the end, all bidders withdrew from the bidding, resulting in no winning bid for Gadget B.\n\nHere's the updated status JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 20000,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 0,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 7000,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 3500\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\n      \"Unit Q\": 7000,\n      \"Element R\": 6000\n    },\n    \"Bidder 3\": {\n      \"Machine P\": 6500\n    },\n    \"Bidder 1\": {}\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
