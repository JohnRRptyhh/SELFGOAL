Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value.

Clearly defining the bidding increments SHOULD BE NECESSARY to avoid confusion and ensure fair competition.\n3. Implementing a maximum bid limit MAY BE NECESSARY to prevent overbidding and encourage strategic bidding.\n4. Providing detailed information about the item being auctioned MAY CONTRIBUTE to generating more interest and higher bids.\n5. Allowing bidders to withdraw their bids DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to a fair and transparent auction process.\n\n```"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Appliance O:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $5000\n- Bidder 2: $4500\n- Bidder 3: $5000\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Appliance O, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Appliance O. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.

No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}.

If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format.
