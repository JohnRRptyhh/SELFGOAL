If certain bidders consistently drop out early or have lower budgets, you may have an opportunity to secure items with higher profit potential.\n - Calculate potential profits: Continuously calculate the potential profits for each item based on your estimated value and the current winning bid. This will help you make informed decisions on where to allocate your budget.\n - Adapt bidding strategy: Adjust your bidding strategy based on the behavior of other bidders and the profitability of the items. Be prepared to increase your bids for items with high estimated values and profit potential.\n - Budget management: With a remaining budget of $18800, strategically allocate your funds for bidding on the remaining items. Ensure that you have enough budget to compete for items with higher estimated values.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Appliance O:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3: $4200\n- Bidder 4: $4500\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Assess Remaining Budget: Evaluate your remaining budget of $6300 and allocate a larger portion towards items with higher estimated values and potential profitability.\n - Consider Budget Constraints: Take into account your remaining budget of $800 and ensure that you prioritize items where the potential profit aligns with your budget limitations.\n - Consider Collaboration: Consider collaborating with other bidders to collectively bid on high estimated value items, securing these items at a lower cost and maximizing your profit.\n - Monitor Competition: Keep a close eye on the bidding behavior of other bidders and strategically bid for items where there are signs of them withdrawing or showing less interest.\n - Calculate Potential Profit Margins: Calculate the potential profit margins for each remaining item by subtracting your estimated value from the winning bid. This will help you prioritize items with the highest potential for profit.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Machine P:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $6000\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3: $6000\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Machine P, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Machine P. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.

Ensure that the collaboration strategy aligns with this goal.\n - Strategic Allocation: Prioritize items with a higher profit margin relative to their starting price. This means focusing on items where the difference between your estimated value and the starting price is significant, as it allows for a higher potential profit.\n - Evaluate Competition: Consider the bidding behavior of other bidders. If there are items with high estimated values that align with your budget constraints, but there is less competition from other bidders, prioritize these items to increase the likelihood of winning at a lower bid.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Contraption I:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $3200\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Think step by step of the pros and cons and the consequences of your action (e.g., remaining budget in future bidding) in order to achieve your primary objective.\n3. Consider the given sub-goals and detailed advices, you may choose to focus on some of them to help you decide on your action, or ignore them.\n\nGive your reasons first, then make your final decision clearly.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Monitor True Values: Continuously monitor the true values of the remaining items to make informed decisions about your bidding strategy. This will help you assess the potential profitability of each item and adjust your bidding approach accordingly.\n - Monitor Competitor Behavior: Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other bidders, especially Bidder 3, who has a lower total profit than you but may still pose a competitive threat in the remaining auctions.\n - Be mindful of the potential profit from winning an item: Prioritize items where the potential profit margin is higher, even if it means slightly exceeding your remaining budget, as long as the potential profit justifies the additional investment.\n - Monitor the competition: Keep track of the remaining bidders and their budgets. This can help you gauge the competition and make informed decisions on which items to prioritize based on potential profit and budget constraints.\n - Prioritize High-Value Items: Focus on the items with higher estimated values, such as Element R and Implement G, to potentially secure larger profits within your budget constraints.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Implement G:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $3500\n- Bidder 3: $3500\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Implement G, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Implement G. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.
