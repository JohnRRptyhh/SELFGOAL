This information will help you make informed decisions about which items to prioritize and bid on.\n - Adjust Maximum Bids: Be prepared to adjust your maximum bids based on the changing dynamics of the auction. If a particular item is highly contested, consider whether it aligns with your profit goals and adjust your maximum bid accordingly.\n - Strategic Bidding: Consider the estimated values of the remaining items and prioritize bidding on those with higher estimated values, such as Machine P and Utensil N, to maximize potential profits.\n - Identify Competitors' Bidding Patterns: Analyze the bidding patterns of the remaining bidders in previous rounds to anticipate their behavior in upcoming auctions. Understanding their tendencies can help you strategize and potentially outmaneuver them in the bidding process.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $20000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 2: $3500\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Unit Q: $6000\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Element R: $6500\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * No winning bids\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.
