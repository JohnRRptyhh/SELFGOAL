Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Consider the true value of the items: While your estimated value is important, also consider the true value of the items. If an item has a high true value compared to its starting price and your estimated value, it might be worth allocating more of your remaining budget to win that item.\n - Assess the potential resale value of the remaining item and compare it to your estimated value: Evaluate the potential resale value of the remaining item and compare it to your estimated value. If the potential profit aligns with your goal, consider bidding accordingly.\n - Keep in mind the budget constraints and ensure that any bidding aligns with the overall goal of maximizing the remaining budget while securing profitable items: Ensure that any bidding aligns with the overall goal of maximizing the remaining budget while securing profitable items, taking into account budget constraints.\n - Calculate Potential Profit: Calculate the potential profit for each remaining item by subtracting your estimated value from the true value (which is unknown) and compare it to your remaining budget of $4500. This will help you identify the items that offer the highest potential profit within your budget constraints.\n - Strategic Bidding: Strategically evaluate the estimated value of the remaining item (Appliance O) in relation to its starting price. Consider the potential resale value in the broader market and factor in any consistent deviations observed in previous auctions. Make a well-informed decision on whether to bid on this item based on your risk assessment and profit maximization goals.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $4500\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 2: $800\n  * Bidder 4: $10500\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Widget A: $1200\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Contraption I: $3500\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n    * Gadget B: $1500\n    * Element R: $6000\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.
