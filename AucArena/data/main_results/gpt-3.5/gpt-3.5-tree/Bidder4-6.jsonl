Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Prioritize High Estimated Value Items: Focus on bidding for items with estimated values closer to the true value, as this will maximize potential profit.\n - Adapt to Previous Results: Learn from the previous auction results and adjust your bidding strategy accordingly. For example, if Bidder 3 won an item at a lower price, consider their strategy and apply it to your own bidding approach.\n - Evaluate the remaining budget: Assess the remaining budget and consider the potential profitability of each item in relation to your estimated value. This will help in determining which items are worth pursuing and which ones may require strategic withdrawal.\n - Strategic Budget Allocation: Allocate the remaining budget strategically for the upcoming items. Prioritize items with higher estimated values and potential for higher profits, while also considering the behavior of other bidders and the remaining budget.\n - Assess Competitor Budgets: Try to estimate the remaining budgets of other bidders based on their previous bids and withdrawals. This can help you gauge their financial capacity to continue bidding on high-value items.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $20000\n\n* Total Profits:\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * No winning bids\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

However, be mindful of your remaining budget and ensure that you do not overbid, especially on items with lower estimated values.\n - Assess the remaining items: Evaluate the remaining items (Gadget B, Utensil N, Unit Q, and Appliance O) and compare their estimated values to your remaining budget of $8500. Consider the potential resale value of each item and compare it to your estimated value.\n - Prioritize high-profit items: Identify the items with the potential for high profits based on their estimated value and the current market demand. This will help you maximize your profit with the remaining budget.\n - Consider competition: Take into account the bidding behavior of other bidders and their remaining budgets. This will help you strategize and make informed decisions in the upcoming bidding wars.\n - Analyze Competitors' Profits: Review the total profits of each bidder to understand their success in previous bids. Bidder 3 has a higher profit than Bidder 4, indicating a more successful bidding strategy so far.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Gadget B:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $1200\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3: $1100\n- Bidder 4: $1100\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
