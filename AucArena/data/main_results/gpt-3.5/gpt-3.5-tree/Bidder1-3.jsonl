If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"In this round of bidding for Gizmo F:\n- Bidder 1, Bidder 2, and Bidder 3 all withdrew at the same bid of $2500.\n- Bidder 4 won the item at a bid of $3000, which is lower than the true value of Gizmo F, which is $4000.\n\nBased on this round of bidding, the updated status is as follows:\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 14000,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 4000,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 3500,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 7000\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Unit Q\": 6000\n    },\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\n      \"Element R\": 6500\n    },\n    \"Bidder 3\": {\n      \"Machine P\": 6000,\n      \"Mechanism J\": 5000\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
