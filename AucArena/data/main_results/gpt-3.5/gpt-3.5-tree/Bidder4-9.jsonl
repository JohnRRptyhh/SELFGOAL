The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Strategic Bidding: Given that your budget is now $14,000 and you've already won an item, consider strategically allocating your remaining budget across the upcoming items. Prioritize items with a higher difference between your estimated value and the starting price, as this presents an opportunity for higher profits.\n - Risk Management: While aiming to secure items at favorable prices, be mindful of the potential risk of overbidding. Ensure that your bids align with your estimated values and the potential resale value of the items.\n - Flexibility in Estimations: Be open to adjusting your estimated values for the remaining items based on the market dynamics and the behavior of other bidders. This flexibility can help you make more accurate decisions in the bidding process.\n - Strategic Withdrawal: If an item's bidding price exceeds its estimated value, consider withdrawing from the bidding to conserve your budget for more favorable opportunities in the subsequent items.\n - Compare Estimated Values: Compare your own estimated value of the item with the bidding behavior of other participants. If other bidders consistently drop out at a certain price point, it may indicate that their estimation is lower than yours, prompting you to reevaluate your own estimation.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $14000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n  * Bidder 4: $4000\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Machine P: $6000\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Track Competitors: Keep track of the total profits of other bidders and their remaining budgets. This will provide insights into their bidding capacity and help in making informed decisions during the auction.\n - Risk Management: While aiming to secure items at favorable prices, be mindful of the potential risk of overbidding. Ensure that your bids align with your estimated values and the potential resale value of the items.\n - Information Utilization: Utilize any available information or cues from the auction log and the behavior of other bidders to refine your estimated values for the remaining items. This will enable you to make more informed decisions during the bidding process.\n - Set a maximum bid limit for each item: Based on the potential profit and your remaining budget, establish a maximum bid limit for each item. This will prevent you from overbidding and ensure that you only bid on items where the potential profit outweighs the risk.\n - Compare Estimated Values: Compare your own estimated value of the item with the bidding behavior of other participants. If other bidders consistently drop out at a certain price point, it may indicate that their estimation is lower than yours, prompting you to reevaluate your own estimation.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Unit Q:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Unit Q, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Unit Q. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1.

Bidder 1 has a total profit of $2500, Bidder 4 has a total profit of $4000, and Bidder 3 has a total profit of $4500. This indicates that Bidder 3 has the highest profit, followed by Bidder 4 and then Bidder 1.\n - Monitor Competitor Profits: Keep track of the profits earned by other bidders in previous rounds. This can provide insights into their bidding strategies and help you anticipate their behavior in upcoming auctions.\n - Avoid Overspending: Be cautious not to overspend on items with lower potential resale value. Compare the starting prices and your estimated values to determine which items have the highest potential for profit. Avoid getting caught in bidding wars that may lead to overspending.\n - Strategic Targeting: If a competitor consistently withdraws early, consider leveraging this information to strategically target specific items that align with your estimated value and have the potential for lower competition. This can help maximize your chances of winning items at a lower bid.\n - Strategic Budget Management: With a remaining budget of $14000, strategically allocate your funds for the remaining items based on their estimated values and the behavior of other bidders. Prioritize items where you have a higher estimated value compared to the starting price, and where other bidders have shown a tendency to drop out early.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Gizmo F:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3: $2200\n- Bidder 4: $2500\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

This will maximize your chances of securing items with a high profit margin.\n - Strategic Withdrawal: If the bidding for an item escalates beyond your estimated value or the potential profit margin is not substantial, consider withdrawing from the bidding to conserve budget for more profitable opportunities.\n - Keep track of your total profits and compare them to the other bidders: This will help you gauge your performance and adjust your strategy for the remaining items.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Doodad D:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $2500\n- Bidder 2: $2500\n- Bidder 3: $2500\n- Bidder 4: $2500\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Doodad D, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Doodad D. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.
