Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Analyze Market Perception: Review the true values and winning bids of Mechanism J and Element R to understand the market's perception of these items. Consider any patterns or trends in the bidding behavior for these items.\n - Risk Assessment: Assess the level of risk associated with each remaining item based on the true values and winning bids of previous items. Adjust your estimated values to mitigate potential losses and maximize profits in the upcoming rounds.\n - Information Utilization: Use the insights gained from analyzing previous winning bids to inform your decision-making process in the upcoming auctions. Leverage this information to gain a competitive advantage over other bidders.\n - Evaluate Potential Profit Margins: Calculate the potential profit margins for the remaining items based on their estimated values and starting prices, and prioritize bidding on items where the profit margin is expected to be higher.\n - Prioritize the remaining items based on potential profit: Rank the remaining items based on the potential profit you could make if you win the item at the starting price.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Widget A:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Widget A, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Widget A. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.
