Items with higher desirability may warrant a higher estimated value, especially if they align with market trends or have unique features that could drive up their resale value.\n - Calculate Potential Profit: Calculate the potential profit for each remaining item by subtracting your estimated value from the true value (if known) or the winning bid (if you win the item).\n - Set Maximum Bidding Threshold: Determine a maximum bidding threshold for each remaining item based on its estimated value and profit potential. If the bidding exceeds this threshold, be prepared to strategically withdraw to conserve your budget for more profitable items.\n - Adapt to Competitive Dynamics: Stay adaptable to the competitive dynamics of the auction.

Try to understand their strategy and how it aligns with the true values of the items.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Widget A:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $1100\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3: $1100\n- Bidder 4: $1200\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Consider Item Rarity: Assess the rarity of the remaining items and how it may impact their true values. Rare items may have higher resale values, while common items may have lower values.\n - Adjust Budget Allocation: Based on the research and analysis of historical data, consider adjusting the budget allocation for the remaining items to maximize profit. Allocate more budget to items with higher potential resale values based on historical data.\n - Monitor Competitor Bids: Keep a close eye on the bidding behavior of your competitors. If they consistently overbid, it may be beneficial to let them win certain items and focus on items where you have a higher potential profit margin.\n - Profit Margin Analysis: Analyze the potential profit margin for the remaining items (Thingamajig C and Apparatus H) based on their true value and your estimated value. Consider the difference between the true value and your estimated value to determine the potential profit.\n - Risk Management: Evaluate the potential profit margins for each item and consider the level of risk associated with bidding. Ensure that the potential profit outweighs the risk of overspending and falling short of the budget.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $15300\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $5000\n  * Bidder 2: $6600\n  * Bidder 4: $3300\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Doodad D: $2500\n    * Appliance O: $4500\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Utensil N: $4900\n    * Machine P: $6500\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Widget A: $1200\n    * Contraption I: $3500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.
