However, be cautious and ensure that collaboration aligns with the goal of maximizing profit.","8":"Observe Item Desirability: Assess the desirability of the remaining items and anticipate the level of competition they might attract.

This will help conserve budget for items with higher profit potential.","47":"Opportunistic Bidding: Identify opportunities where other bidders may withdraw early, allowing you to secure items at a lower price than initially anticipated. This requires quick decision-making and a keen understanding of the market dynamics.","48":"Long-term Profit Maximization: Keep the overall goal of maximizing profit in mind and make strategic decisions that contribute to achieving this goal over the course of the entire auction, rather than focusing solely on individual items."}},"arms_cnt":{"Bidder 1":[],"Bidder 2":[],"Bidder 3":[],"Bidder 4":[1,5,18,25,31,38,42,44,48,49,49,49]},"model_info":{"Bidder 1":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 2":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 3":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 4":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106"}}
