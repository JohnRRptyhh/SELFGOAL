This is because the profit from winning Mechanism J ($3100) is subtracted from the initial budget when calculating the remaining budget. However, the total profits for Bidder 4 should include this profit, so it is shown as $3100 in the JSON output.","tag":"summarize_0"},{"messages":[{"system":"You are Bidder 4, who is attending an ascending-bid auction as a bidder.
