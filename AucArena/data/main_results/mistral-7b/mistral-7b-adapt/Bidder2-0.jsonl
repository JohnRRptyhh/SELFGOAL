If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Based on the bidding history, here's the summary of the notable behaviors of all bidders in this round:\n\n- Bidder 1, Bidder 2, and Bidder 3 initially bid $3500 each in Round 0.\n- Bidder 4 bid $3000 in Round 0.\n- Bidder 1, Bidder 2, and Bidder 3 withdrew in Round 1.\n- Bidder 4 won Implement G with a bid of $4200 in Round 1.\n\nNow, let's update the status JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 11100,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 4000,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 3300,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 8600\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\n      \"Widget A\": 1200,\n      \"Apparatus H\": 3500\n    },\n    \"Bidder 3\": {\n      \"Appliance O\": 4200,\n      \"Equipment E\": 2200,\n      \"Mechanism J\": 5000\n    },\n    \"Bidder 4\": {\n      \"Gadget B\": 1301,\n      \"Utensil N\": 6500,\n      \"Thingamajig C\": 2200,\n      \"Doodad D\": 2501,\n      \"Gizmo F\": 2750,\n      \"Implement G\": 4200\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
