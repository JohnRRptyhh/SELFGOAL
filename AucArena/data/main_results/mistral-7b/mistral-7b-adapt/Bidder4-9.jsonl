If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Based on the given bidding history, no bidder won any item in this round, so all bidders, including Bidder 4, remain with their previous winning bids and total profits. Therefore, the JSON output remains the same as the previous one:\n\n```json\n{\"remaining_budget\": 800, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 6300, \"Bidder 2\": 10500, \"Bidder 4\": 4800}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Contraption I\": 3200, \"Equipment E\": 2000, \"Gizmo F\": 2500}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Widget A\": 1200, \"Thingamajig C\": 1100, \"Gadget B\": 1500, \"Utensil N\": 4200, \"Element R\": 5500}, \"Bidder 4\": {\"Unit Q\": 10500, \"Mechanism J\": 4900, \"Apparatus H\": 3800}}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
