The minimum increase over this highest bid is $100. Do I have any advance on $1500?\""}],"result":"Given that the highest bid for Widget A is $1500 from Bidder 3 and the minimum increase over the highest bid is $100, I have to decide whether to increase my bid by $100 or withdraw from the bidding for Widget A.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. My estimated value for Widget A is $2200, and my current bid is $1400. Increasing my bid by $100 would bring my total bid to $1500, which is still below the current highest bid.\n2. If I increase my bid by $100, I will be spending an additional $100 on Widget A, which would leave me with a remaining budget of $1300 for future bidding.\n3. Given that my estimated value for Gadget B is $3500 and my current budget is $1300, I would not be able to secure Gadget B with my remaining budget if I increase my bid for Widget A by $100.\n4. Since my primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of the auction, I need to consider the potential profit I can make from each item and the budget I have left for future bidding.\n5. Given the current status, I believe that securing Gadget B with a bid of $1400 is a better decision than increasing my bid for Widget A by $100, as it would give me a higher potential profit and still leave me with a reasonable budget for future bidding.\n\nTherefore, I will not increase my bid for Widget A and will instead focus on securing Gadget B with my current bid of $1400.","tag":"bid_14"},{"messages":[{"system":"You are Bidder 4, who is attending an ascending-bid auction as a bidder.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item.
