However, since their remaining budget is now $15,000, their total profits cannot be $3,100 because that would mean they spent $11,900 in previous rounds, which is not the case. Therefore, their total profits must be $900, which is the profit they made from winning Mechanism J in this round.\n- Bidder 4's winning bids are {\"Mechanism J\": 4900} because they won Mechanism J in this round and their winning bid for it was $4,900.","tag":"summarize_0"},{"messages":[{"system":"You are Bidder 4, who is attending an ascending-bid auction as a bidder.

Given my remaining budget of $1600 and the high bids from other bidders, I need to reconsider my strategy for Appliance O. I cannot afford to bid $4500 and still have enough budget for the remaining items.\n\nBased on my priority list, Appliance O is still a top priority item for me. However, I need to be more cautious with my bidding and focus on securing items that have a lower starting price or are within my current budget.\n\nGiven the current situation, I will withdraw from bidding on Appliance O. I will focus on the remaining items that have lower starting prices or that I can afford with my current budget.\n\nReason for decision: I cannot afford to bid $4500 for Appliance O and still have enough budget for the remaining items.
