High initial bids MAY BE NECCESSARY to attract serious bidders. In this case, Bidder 4 entered the bidding war at a significantly higher price than the starting bid, indicating that they were serious about winning the auction.\n2. Withdrawals by potential bidders MAY BE NORMAL in the early stages of an auction. All four bidders withdrew their bids before Bidder 4 entered, which is not uncommon in auctions as bidders assess the competition and their own willingness to pay.\n3. Absence of competition MAY CONTRIBUTE to a higher final price. In this auction, the lack of competition allowed Bidder 4 to secure the item at a higher price than they might have paid in a more competitive environment.\n4. Withdrawals by potential bidders DO NOT CONTRIBUTE to the final price if they do not place a bid before withdrawing. In this auction, the withdrawals did not impact the final price as no bids were placed before the withdrawal.\n5.
