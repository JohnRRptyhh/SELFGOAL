Starting price may influence bidding:\n   * A higher starting price may attract more serious bidders.\n   * A lower starting price may result in more bidders entering the auction.\n\n3.

Consider setting a higher starting price to attract more serious bidders.\n2. Implement shorter bidding intervals to increase competition and bidding intensity.\n3. Monitor bidder behavior closely and be prepared for unexpected withdrawals or changes in bidding patterns.\n4.
