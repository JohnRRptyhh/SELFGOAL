Based on the provided auction log, here are some learnings:\n\n1. Having multiple bidders at the starting price may not necessarily lead to a higher final price. (Bidder 3 withdrew, and the final price was lower than both bidders' initial bids.)\n2. Bidders may be more likely to withdraw if they are not the highest bidder after the first round. (Bidders 1 and 2 both withdrew after the first round.)\n3. A significant price increase in the first round may deter some bidders from continuing in the auction. (Both Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 withdrew after Bidder 4 increased the price by $2000.)\n4. A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale, as some bidders may be deterred by the high starting price. (The auction did not reach the reserve price, which was not specified in the log.)\n5. It may be beneficial to monitor the behavior of bidders in the first round and adjust strategies accordingly. (For example, if multiple bidders are at the starting price, it may be worth increasing the bid to discourage them and potentially secure a lower final price with fewer bidders.)\n\nIn summary:\n\n1. Having multiple bidders at starting price may not necessarily lead to a higher final price.\n2. Bidders may be more likely to withdraw if they are not the highest bidder after the first round.\n3. A significant price increase in the first round may deter some bidders from continuing in the auction.\n4. A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale.\n5. Monitoring bidder behavior in the first round and adjusting strategies accordingly may be beneficial.\nLearnings:\n-1. Monitoring bidder behavior in the first round MAY BE NECCESSARY to optimize bidding strategies and potentially secure a lower final price with fewer bidders.\n2. Setting a more moderate initial bid MAY BE NECCESSARY to encourage more bidders to participate and potentially reach a higher final price.\n3. Implementing a gradual price increase MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to keeping bidders engaged and reducing the likelihood of them withdrawing.\n4. Offering a reserve price MAY BE NECCESSARY to ensure a successful sale and prevent the auction from ending below the minimum acceptable price.\n5. Allowing multiple bidders at the starting price MAY NOT CONTRIBUTE to a higher final price if it results in a significant price increase that deters other bidders.\n6. Withdrawing a bid after the first round MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to reducing competition and potentially securing a lower final price with fewer bidders.\n7. Setting an extremely high initial bid MAY NOT CONTRIBUTE to a successful sale if it deters potential bidders from participating due to the perceived high risk or cost.\nLearnings:\n-1.

Having multiple bidders at starting price may not necessarily lead to a higher final price.\n2. Bidders may be more likely to withdraw if they are not the highest bidder after the first round.\n3. A significant price increase in the first round may deter some bidders from continuing in the auction.\n4. A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale.\n5. Monitoring bidder behavior in the first round and adjusting strategies accordingly may be beneficial.\nLearnings:\n-1. Monitoring bidder behavior in the first round MAY BE NECCESSARY to optimize bidding strategies and potentially secure a lower final price with fewer bidders.\n2. Setting a more moderate initial bid MAY BE NECCESSARY to encourage more bidders to participate and potentially reach a higher final price.\n3. Implementing a gradual price increase MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to keeping bidders engaged and reducing the likelihood of them withdrawing.\n4. Offering a reserve price MAY BE NECCESSARY to ensure a successful sale and prevent the auction from ending below the minimum acceptable price.\n5. Allowing multiple bidders at the starting price MAY NOT CONTRIBUTE to a higher final price if it results in a significant price increase that deters other bidders.\n6. Withdrawing a bid after the first round MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to reducing competition and potentially securing a lower final price with fewer bidders.\n7. Setting an extremely high initial bid MAY NOT CONTRIBUTE to a successful sale if it deters potential bidders from participating due to the perceived high risk or cost.\nLearnings:\n-1.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction.

(Bidder 3 withdrew, and the final price was lower than both bidders' initial bids.)\n2. Bidders may be more likely to withdraw if they are not the highest bidder after the first round. (Bidders 1 and 2 both withdrew after the first round.)\n3. A significant price increase in the first round may deter some bidders from continuing in the auction. (Both Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 withdrew after Bidder 4 increased the price by $2000.)\n4. A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale, as some bidders may be deterred by the high starting price. (The auction did not reach the reserve price, which was not specified in the log.)\n5. It may be beneficial to monitor the behavior of bidders in the first round and adjust strategies accordingly.

A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale, as some bidders may be deterred by the high starting price. (The auction did not reach the reserve price, which was not specified in the log.)\n5. It may be beneficial to monitor the behavior of bidders in the first round and adjust strategies accordingly.

Based on the provided auction log, here are some learnings:\n\n1. Having multiple bidders at the starting price may not necessarily lead to a higher final price. (Bidder 3 withdrew, and the final price was lower than both bidders' initial bids.)\n2. Bidders may be more likely to withdraw if they are not the highest bidder after the first round. (Bidders 1 and 2 both withdrew after the first round.)\n3. A significant price increase in the first round may deter some bidders from continuing in the auction. (Both Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 withdrew after Bidder 4 increased the price by $2000.)\n4. A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale, as some bidders may be deterred by the high starting price. (The auction did not reach the reserve price, which was not specified in the log.)\n5. It may be beneficial to monitor the behavior of bidders in the first round and adjust strategies accordingly. (For example, if multiple bidders are at the starting price, it may be worth increasing the bid to discourage them and potentially secure a lower final price with fewer bidders.)\n\nIn summary:\n\n1.

Monitoring bidder behavior in the first round MAY BE NECCESSARY to optimize bidding strategies and potentially secure a lower final price with fewer bidders.\n2. Setting a more moderate initial bid MAY BE NECCESSARY to encourage more bidders to participate and potentially reach a higher final price.\n3. Implementing a gradual price increase MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to keeping bidders engaged and reducing the likelihood of them withdrawing.\n4. Offering a reserve price MAY BE NECCESSARY to ensure a successful sale and prevent the auction from ending below the minimum acceptable price.\n5. Allowing multiple bidders at the starting price MAY NOT CONTRIBUTE to a higher final price if it results in a significant price increase that deters other bidders.\n6. Withdrawing a bid after the first round MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to reducing competition and potentially securing a lower final price with fewer bidders.\n7.

Here's your previous status:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $1350\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $800\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n  * Bidder 4: $7350\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Widget A: $1200\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * No winning bids\n```\n\nSummarize the notable behaviors of all bidders in this round of bidding for future reference. Then, update the status JSON regarding the following information:\n- 'remaining_budget': The remaining budget of you, expressed as a numerical value.\n- 'total_profits': The total profits achieved so far for each bidder, where a numerical value following a bidder's name. No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}. If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format.

The remaining budget is now 0 since Bidder 4 lost the auction and spent their entire budget.\n2. Bidder 1 had a total profit of $8035 from their winning bids on other items.\n3. Bidder 2 had a total profit of $6000 from winning Element R.\n4. Bidder 4 had a total profit of $7350 from their winning bids on other items.\n5.

Based on the provided auction log, here are some learnings:\n\n1. Having multiple bidders at the starting price may not necessarily lead to a higher final price. (Bidder 3 withdrew, and the final price was lower than both bidders' initial bids.)\n2. Bidders may be more likely to withdraw if they are not the highest bidder after the first round. (Bidders 1 and 2 both withdrew after the first round.)\n3. A significant price increase in the first round may deter some bidders from continuing in the auction. (Both Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 withdrew after Bidder 4 increased the price by $2000.)\n4. A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale, as some bidders may be deterred by the high starting price. (The auction did not reach the reserve price, which was not specified in the log.)\n5. It may be beneficial to monitor the behavior of bidders in the first round and adjust strategies accordingly.

Based on the provided auction log, here are some learnings:\n\n1. Having multiple bidders at the starting price may not necessarily lead to a higher final price. (Bidder 3 withdrew, and the final price was lower than both bidders' initial bids.)\n2. Bidders may be more likely to withdraw if they are not the highest bidder after the first round. (Bidders 1 and 2 both withdrew after the first round.)\n3. A significant price increase in the first round may deter some bidders from continuing in the auction. (Both Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 withdrew after Bidder 4 increased the price by $2000.)\n4. A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale, as some bidders may be deterred by the high starting price. (The auction did not reach the reserve price, which was not specified in the log.)\n5. It may be beneficial to monitor the behavior of bidders in the first round and adjust strategies accordingly. (For example, if multiple bidders are at the starting price, it may be worth increasing the bid to discourage them and potentially secure a lower final price with fewer bidders.)\n\nIn summary:\n\n1. Having multiple bidders at starting price may not necessarily lead to a higher final price.\n2. Bidders may be more likely to withdraw if they are not the highest bidder after the first round.\n3. A significant price increase in the first round may deter some bidders from continuing in the auction.\n4. A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale.\n5. Monitoring bidder behavior in the first round and adjusting strategies accordingly may be beneficial.\nLearnings:\n-1. Monitoring bidder behavior in the first round MAY BE NECCESSARY to optimize bidding strategies and potentially secure a lower final price with fewer bidders.\n2. Setting a more moderate initial bid MAY BE NECCESSARY to encourage more bidders to participate and potentially reach a higher final price.\n3. Implementing a gradual price increase MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to keeping bidders engaged and reducing the likelihood of them withdrawing.\n4. Offering a reserve price MAY BE NECCESSARY to ensure a successful sale and prevent the auction from ending below the minimum acceptable price.\n5. Allowing multiple bidders at the starting price MAY NOT CONTRIBUTE to a higher final price if it results in a significant price increase that deters other bidders.\n6. Withdrawing a bid after the first round MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to reducing competition and potentially securing a lower final price with fewer bidders.\n7. Setting an extremely high initial bid MAY NOT CONTRIBUTE to a successful sale if it deters potential bidders from participating due to the perceived high risk or cost.\nLearnings:\n-1.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid.

Based on the provided auction log, here are some learnings:\n\n1. Having multiple bidders at the starting price may not necessarily lead to a higher final price. (Bidder 3 withdrew, and the final price was lower than both bidders' initial bids.)\n2. Bidders may be more likely to withdraw if they are not the highest bidder after the first round. (Bidders 1 and 2 both withdrew after the first round.)\n3. A significant price increase in the first round may deter some bidders from continuing in the auction. (Both Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 withdrew after Bidder 4 increased the price by $2000.)\n4. A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale, as some bidders may be deterred by the high starting price. (The auction did not reach the reserve price, which was not specified in the log.)\n5. It may be beneficial to monitor the behavior of bidders in the first round and adjust strategies accordingly. (For example, if multiple bidders are at the starting price, it may be worth increasing the bid to discourage them and potentially secure a lower final price with fewer bidders.)\n\nIn summary:\n\n1.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item.

(Bidder 3 withdrew, and the final price was lower than both bidders' initial bids.)\n2. Bidders may be more likely to withdraw if they are not the highest bidder after the first round. (Bidders 1 and 2 both withdrew after the first round.)\n3. A significant price increase in the first round may deter some bidders from continuing in the auction. (Both Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 withdrew after Bidder 4 increased the price by $2000.)\n4. A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale, as some bidders may be deterred by the high starting price. (The auction did not reach the reserve price, which was not specified in the log.)\n5. It may be beneficial to monitor the behavior of bidders in the first round and adjust strategies accordingly.

Based on the provided auction log, here are some learnings:\n\n1. Having multiple bidders at the starting price may not necessarily lead to a higher final price. (Bidder 3 withdrew, and the final price was lower than both bidders' initial bids.)\n2. Bidders may be more likely to withdraw if they are not the highest bidder after the first round. (Bidders 1 and 2 both withdrew after the first round.)\n3. A significant price increase in the first round may deter some bidders from continuing in the auction. (Both Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 withdrew after Bidder 4 increased the price by $2000.)\n4. A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale, as some bidders may be deterred by the high starting price. (The auction did not reach the reserve price, which was not specified in the log.)\n5. It may be beneficial to monitor the behavior of bidders in the first round and adjust strategies accordingly. (For example, if multiple bidders are at the starting price, it may be worth increasing the bid to discourage them and potentially secure a lower final price with fewer bidders.)\n\nIn summary:\n\n1.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction.

(Both Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 withdrew after Bidder 4 increased the price by $2000.)\n4. A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale, as some bidders may be deterred by the high starting price. (The auction did not reach the reserve price, which was not specified in the log.)\n5. It may be beneficial to monitor the behavior of bidders in the first round and adjust strategies accordingly.

Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item.

(Bidder 3 withdrew, and the final price was lower than both bidders' initial bids.)\n2. Bidders may be more likely to withdraw if they are not the highest bidder after the first round. (Bidders 1 and 2 both withdrew after the first round.)\n3. A significant price increase in the first round may deter some bidders from continuing in the auction. (Both Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 withdrew after Bidder 4 increased the price by $2000.)\n4. A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale, as some bidders may be deterred by the high starting price. (The auction did not reach the reserve price, which was not specified in the log.)\n5. It may be beneficial to monitor the behavior of bidders in the first round and adjust strategies accordingly. (For example, if multiple bidders are at the starting price, it may be worth increasing the bid to discourage them and potentially secure a lower final price with fewer bidders.)\n\nIn summary:\n\n1.

Based on the provided auction log, here are some learnings:\n\n1. Having multiple bidders at the starting price may not necessarily lead to a higher final price. (Bidder 3 withdrew, and the final price was lower than both bidders' initial bids.)\n2. Bidders may be more likely to withdraw if they are not the highest bidder after the first round. (Bidders 1 and 2 both withdrew after the first round.)\n3. A significant price increase in the first round may deter some bidders from continuing in the auction. (Both Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 withdrew after Bidder 4 increased the price by $2000.)\n4. A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale, as some bidders may be deterred by the high starting price. (The auction did not reach the reserve price, which was not specified in the log.)\n5. It may be beneficial to monitor the behavior of bidders in the first round and adjust strategies accordingly. (For example, if multiple bidders are at the starting price, it may be worth increasing the bid to discourage them and potentially secure a lower final price with fewer bidders.)\n\nIn summary:\n\n1.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction.

(Both Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 withdrew after Bidder 4 increased the price by $2000.)\n4. A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale, as some bidders may be deterred by the high starting price. (The auction did not reach the reserve price, which was not specified in the log.)\n5. It may be beneficial to monitor the behavior of bidders in the first round and adjust strategies accordingly.

Based on the provided auction log, here are some learnings:\n\n1. Having multiple bidders at the starting price may not necessarily lead to a higher final price. (Bidder 3 withdrew, and the final price was lower than both bidders' initial bids.)\n2. Bidders may be more likely to withdraw if they are not the highest bidder after the first round. (Bidders 1 and 2 both withdrew after the first round.)\n3. A significant price increase in the first round may deter some bidders from continuing in the auction. (Both Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 withdrew after Bidder 4 increased the price by $2000.)\n4. A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale, as some bidders may be deterred by the high starting price. (The auction did not reach the reserve price, which was not specified in the log.)\n5. It may be beneficial to monitor the behavior of bidders in the first round and adjust strategies accordingly.

Based on the provided auction log, here are some learnings:\n\n1. Having multiple bidders at the starting price may not necessarily lead to a higher final price. (Bidder 3 withdrew, and the final price was lower than both bidders' initial bids.)\n2. Bidders may be more likely to withdraw if they are not the highest bidder after the first round. (Bidders 1 and 2 both withdrew after the first round.)\n3. A significant price increase in the first round may deter some bidders from continuing in the auction. (Both Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 withdrew after Bidder 4 increased the price by $2000.)\n4. A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale, as some bidders may be deterred by the high starting price. (The auction did not reach the reserve price, which was not specified in the log.)\n5. It may be beneficial to monitor the behavior of bidders in the first round and adjust strategies accordingly. (For example, if multiple bidders are at the starting price, it may be worth increasing the bid to discourage them and potentially secure a lower final price with fewer bidders.)\n\nIn summary:\n\n1.

Monitoring bidder behavior in the first round and adjusting strategies accordingly may be beneficial.\nLearnings:\n-1. Monitoring bidder behavior in the first round MAY BE NECCESSARY to optimize bidding strategies and potentially secure a lower final price with fewer bidders.\n2. Setting a more moderate initial bid MAY BE NECCESSARY to encourage more bidders to participate and potentially reach a higher final price.\n3. Implementing a gradual price increase MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to keeping bidders engaged and reducing the likelihood of them withdrawing.\n4. Offering a reserve price MAY BE NECCESSARY to ensure a successful sale and prevent the auction from ending below the minimum acceptable price.\n5. Allowing multiple bidders at the starting price MAY NOT CONTRIBUTE to a higher final price if it results in a significant price increase that deters other bidders.\n6. Withdrawing a bid after the first round MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to reducing competition and potentially securing a lower final price with fewer bidders.\n7.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid.

Based on the provided auction log, here are some learnings:\n\n1. Having multiple bidders at the starting price may not necessarily lead to a higher final price. (Bidder 3 withdrew, and the final price was lower than both bidders' initial bids.)\n2. Bidders may be more likely to withdraw if they are not the highest bidder after the first round. (Bidders 1 and 2 both withdrew after the first round.)\n3. A significant price increase in the first round may deter some bidders from continuing in the auction. (Both Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 withdrew after Bidder 4 increased the price by $2000.)\n4. A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale, as some bidders may be deterred by the high starting price. (The auction did not reach the reserve price, which was not specified in the log.)\n5. It may be beneficial to monitor the behavior of bidders in the first round and adjust strategies accordingly. (For example, if multiple bidders are at the starting price, it may be worth increasing the bid to discourage them and potentially secure a lower final price with fewer bidders.)\n\nIn summary:\n\n1.

Based on the provided auction log, here are some learnings:\n\n1. Having multiple bidders at the starting price may not necessarily lead to a higher final price. (Bidder 3 withdrew, and the final price was lower than both bidders' initial bids.)\n2. Bidders may be more likely to withdraw if they are not the highest bidder after the first round. (Bidders 1 and 2 both withdrew after the first round.)\n3. A significant price increase in the first round may deter some bidders from continuing in the auction. (Both Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 withdrew after Bidder 4 increased the price by $2000.)\n4. A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale, as some bidders may be deterred by the high starting price. (The auction did not reach the reserve price, which was not specified in the log.)\n5. It may be beneficial to monitor the behavior of bidders in the first round and adjust strategies accordingly. (For example, if multiple bidders are at the starting price, it may be worth increasing the bid to discourage them and potentially secure a lower final price with fewer bidders.)\n\nIn summary:\n\n1. Having multiple bidders at starting price may not necessarily lead to a higher final price.\n2. Bidders may be more likely to withdraw if they are not the highest bidder after the first round.\n3.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction.

(Bidder 3 withdrew, and the final price was lower than both bidders' initial bids.)\n2. Bidders may be more likely to withdraw if they are not the highest bidder after the first round. (Bidders 1 and 2 both withdrew after the first round.)\n3. A significant price increase in the first round may deter some bidders from continuing in the auction. (Both Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 withdrew after Bidder 4 increased the price by $2000.)\n4. A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale, as some bidders may be deterred by the high starting price. (The auction did not reach the reserve price, which was not specified in the log.)\n5. It may be beneficial to monitor the behavior of bidders in the first round and adjust strategies accordingly.

Based on the provided auction log, here are some learnings:\n\n1. Having multiple bidders at the starting price may not necessarily lead to a higher final price. (Bidder 3 withdrew, and the final price was lower than both bidders' initial bids.)\n2. Bidders may be more likely to withdraw if they are not the highest bidder after the first round. (Bidders 1 and 2 both withdrew after the first round.)\n3. A significant price increase in the first round may deter some bidders from continuing in the auction. (Both Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 withdrew after Bidder 4 increased the price by $2000.)\n4. A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale, as some bidders may be deterred by the high starting price. (The auction did not reach the reserve price, which was not specified in the log.)\n5. It may be beneficial to monitor the behavior of bidders in the first round and adjust strategies accordingly. (For example, if multiple bidders are at the starting price, it may be worth increasing the bid to discourage them and potentially secure a lower final price with fewer bidders.)\n\nIn summary:\n\n1.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction. You can use them to guide this auction:\n```\nLearnings:\n-m here to help you reflect on the historical data from the past auction and extract strategic learnings for future auctions. Based on the provided auction log, here are some learnings:\n\n1. Having multiple bidders at the starting price may not necessarily lead to a higher final price. (Bidder 3 withdrew, and the final price was lower than both bidders' initial bids.)\n2. Bidders may be more likely to withdraw if they are not the highest bidder after the first round. (Bidders 1 and 2 both withdrew after the first round.)\n3. A significant price increase in the first round may deter some bidders from continuing in the auction. (Both Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 withdrew after Bidder 4 increased the price by $2000.)\n4. A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale, as some bidders may be deterred by the high starting price. (The auction did not reach the reserve price, which was not specified in the log.)\n5. It may be beneficial to monitor the behavior of bidders in the first round and adjust strategies accordingly. (For example, if multiple bidders are at the starting price, it may be worth increasing the bid to discourage them and potentially secure a lower final price with fewer bidders.)\n\nIn summary:\n\n1. Having multiple bidders at starting price may not necessarily lead to a higher final price.\n2. Bidders may be more likely to withdraw if they are not the highest bidder after the first round.\n3. A significant price increase in the first round may deter some bidders from continuing in the auction.\n4. A high initial bid may not necessarily result in a successful sale.\n5. Monitoring bidder behavior in the first round and adjusting strategies accordingly may be beneficial.\nLearnings:\n-1. Monitoring bidder behavior in the first round MAY BE NECCESSARY to optimize bidding strategies and potentially secure a lower final price with fewer bidders.\n2. Setting a more moderate initial bid MAY BE NECCESSARY to encourage more bidders to participate and potentially reach a higher final price.\n3. Implementing a gradual price increase MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to keeping bidders engaged and reducing the likelihood of them withdrawing.\n4. Offering a reserve price MAY BE NECCESSARY to ensure a successful sale and prevent the auction from ending below the minimum acceptable price.\n5. Allowing multiple bidders at the starting price MAY NOT CONTRIBUTE to a higher final price if it results in a significant price increase that deters other bidders.\n6. Withdrawing a bid after the first round MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to reducing competition and potentially securing a lower final price with fewer bidders.\n7. Setting an extremely high initial bid MAY NOT CONTRIBUTE to a successful sale if it deters potential bidders from participating due to the perceived high risk or cost.\nLearnings:\n-1.
