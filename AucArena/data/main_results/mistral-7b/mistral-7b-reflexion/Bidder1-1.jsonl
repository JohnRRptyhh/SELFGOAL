If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Based on the bidding history, Bidder 3 won Apparatus H at $3500, with a true value of $6000. Bidder 1 withdrew from the bidding, and Bidder 4 also withdrew after placing a bid.\n\nHere's the updated status JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 9300,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 7300,\n    \"Bidder 4\": 11149,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 0\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Contraption I\": 3200,\n      \"Machine P\": 6000,\n      \"Thingamajig C\": 1500\n    },\n    \"Bidder 4\": {\n      \"Utensil N\": 4901,\n      \"Mechanism J\": 4900,\n      \"Gadget B\": 1300,\n      \"Doodad D\": 2700,\n      \"Implement G\": 3850,\n      \"Widget A\": 1200\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
