Then, update the status JSON regarding the following information:\n- 'remaining_budget': The remaining budget of you, expressed as a numerical value.\n- 'total_profits': The total profits achieved so far for each bidder, where a numerical value following a bidder's name. No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}.

Therefore, they all withdrew in the second round.\n- Bidder 4, being the only bidder left, won Contraption I at $3500.\n\nNow, let's update the status JSON based on the given information:\n\n```json\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 2500, \"Bidder 4\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 4\": {\"Contraption I\": 3500}}}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- Bidder 1 had a profit of $2500 from previous rounds, but they didn't win any item in this round, so their total profits remain the same.\n- Bidder 4 didn't have any profits before, but they won Contraption I in this round, so their total profits are now $3500 (winning bid) - $3500 (paid bid) = $0.\n- Bidder 4's winning bid for Contraption I is recorded in the 'winning_bids' section.\n- The remaining budget is updated to $8000, as no bids were placed in this round.","tag":"summarize_3"},{"messages":[{"system":"You are Bidder 4, who is attending an ascending-bid auction as a bidder.
