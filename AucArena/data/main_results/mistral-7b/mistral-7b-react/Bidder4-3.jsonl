If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Based on the given bidding history, no bidder won Implement G in this round. Therefore, all bidders, including Bidder 4, remain with their previous winning bids and profits.\n\nHere's the updated status for Bidder 4:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 278,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 4\": 4278\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 4\": {\n      \"Doodad D\": 2501,\n      \"Widget A\": 2100,\n      \"Mechanism J\": 8800,\n      \"Thingamajig C\": 1501,\n      \"Gadget B\": 1300,\n      \"Apparatus H\": 3520\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
