If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Based on the bidding history, all bidders bid the same amount for Gizmo F in Round 0, and then all withdrew in Round 1. This indicates that all bidders had a similar estimation of the item's value and were not willing to bid higher than their initial bid.\n\nHere's the updated status JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 20000,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 4700,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 4300,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 0\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Unit Q\": 6000,\n      \"Thingamajig C\": 1300\n    },\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\n      \"Equipment E\": 2500,\n      \"Apparatus H\": 3200\n    },\n    \"Bidder 3\": {}\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
