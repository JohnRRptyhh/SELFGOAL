Given that your remaining budget is $6196 and the total profits of the other bidders are $10,300, it may be worth bidding more than your estimated value for this item if the competition is not too fierce.","1":"Consider the remaining budget: Given your remaining budget of $695, it's essential to consider how much you are willing to spend on Thingamajig C and still have enough budget left for the remaining items. If the estimated value of Thingamajig C is too high given your remaining budget, it may be necessary to reconsider your bidding strategy for this item.","2":"Calculate the potential profit for each remaining item: To determine which item to bid on next, Bidder 4 should calculate the potential profit for each of the remaining items (Doodad D, Gizmo F, and Implement G) based on their estimated values and the current budget.","3":"Compare potential profits: Once the potential profits for each item have been calculated, Bidder 4 should compare them to determine which item offers the highest potential profit.","4":"Bid on the item with the highest potential profit and lowest opportunity cost: Based on the potential profits and opportunity costs, Bidder 4 should bid on the item that offers the highest potential profit and the lowest opportunity cost.","5":"Adjust bidding strategy if necessary: If the starting price of the item with the highest potential profit is too high, Bidder 4 may need to adjust their bidding strategy to increase their chances of winning the item at a lower price. This could involve setting a maximum bid below the starting price and waiting for other bidders to drop out, or making a lower initial bid and gradually increasing it as the bidding war progresses.","6":"Consider the remaining budget: With a remaining budget of $695, it's essential to consider whether bidding on Doodad D is worth it, given the potential profit and the remaining budget.","7":"Monitor the bidding behavior of other bidders: Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other bidders for Doodad D and Gizmo F. If the bidding for one of these items gets too high, it may be worth adjusting your strategy and focusing on the other item instead.","8":"Thingamajig C: Given that your remaining budget is limited and your estimated value for this item is only $2200, it may not be worth bidding on this item if other bidders enter the bidding war. Instead, you could focus on securing items with a higher potential profit or bidding strategically to force other bidders out of the bidding war for certain items.","9":"Doodad D: With an estimated value of $4400 and a starting price of $2000, this item presents a relatively low-risk opportunity for a profit. However, given that you have already won several items and your remaining budget is limited, it may be more beneficial to focus on securing items with a higher potential profit or bidding strategically to force other bidders out of the bidding war for certain items.","10":"Manage your budget: Given your remaining budget of $695, it's essential to manage your budget carefully to ensure that you don't overspend on any single item. This may involve setting a maximum bid for each item based on your estimated value and your remaining budget.","11":"Evaluate the competition: Given that the starting price of 'Implement G' is higher than your estimated value, it's essential to evaluate the competition carefully. Check the bidding history of other bidders and their remaining budgets to determine their potential bids and the likelihood of winning the item at a profit.","12":"Set a maximum bid: Based on your estimated value, the competition, and your remaining budget, set a maximum bid for 'Implement G' that maximizes your potential profit while staying within your budget.","13":"Consider alternative strategies: If the competition is high, or the starting price is too high, you may want to consider alternative strategies to secure 'Implement G' at a profit. For example, you could try to negotiate a lower price with the seller outside of the auction or wait for a future auction with a lower starting price.","14":"Adjust your bidding strategy: Based on your refined estimated values and the remaining items in the auction, adjust your bidding strategy accordingly. For example, if you have identified items with a large difference between the hammer prices and your estimated values, you may want to focus on those items to maximize your profit. Conversely, if you have identified items with a small difference between the hammer prices and your estimated values, you may want to avoid bidding on those items to conserve your budget.","15":"Monitor the relationship between starting prices and hammer prices: Examining the relationship between starting prices and hammer prices can help you determine if certain items are undervalued or overvalued based on their starting prices. For example, if the hammer price of an item is significantly higher than its starting price, it may be worth considering bidding on that item even if your estimated value is lower than the starting price.","16":"Research similar machines: Search online marketplaces, such as eBay, Amazon, and Craigslist, to find sold listings of similar machines with the same specifications and features as Machine P.

For example, if you believe that a trend is likely to increase the demand for Element R, you may want to bid more aggressively to secure the item at a lower price than its future value. Conversely, if you believe that a trend is likely to decrease the demand for Element R, you may want to avoid bidding on it or to bid lower than your estimated value.","29":"Monitor competitors' bidding behavior: Keeping an eye on the bidding behavior of your competitors can also help you adjust your bidding strategy in response to market trends. For example, if you notice that a competitor is bidding aggressively on an item that you believe is likely to become obsolete due to a new technological advancement, you may want to avoid bidding on that item or to bid lower than your estimated value. Conversely, if you notice that a competitor is bidding aggressively on an item that you believe is likely to become more valuable due to a new trend, you may want to adjust your bidding strategy accordingly to stay competitive.","30":"Additional considerations: Consider the condition and functionality of Element R when estimating its value. Keep in mind any additional costs, such as shipping or taxes, that may impact your profit. Consider the time and resources required to sell Element R after winning the auction.

This may involve researching industry news, analyzing sales data, and observing the bidding behavior of other bidders.","38":"Re-evaluate estimated values for items with multiple bidders: If there are multiple bidders for an item and the bidding price is approaching or exceeding the estimated value, consider revising the estimated value upwards to remain competitive in the bidding war.","39":"Consider alternative sources for market information: In addition to observing the bidding behavior of other bidders, consider alternative sources for market information, such as industry experts, market research reports, and online marketplaces. This can help you make more informed decisions about the estimated values and adjust them accordingly.","40":"Evaluate the demand for each item: Before deciding to sell an item, it's essential to assess its demand in the broader market. This can be done by researching the market price, sales volume, and competition for each item.","41":"Identify items with lower demand: Based on the research, identify the items that have lower demand compared to their estimated value. These items may be more challenging to sell quickly or may require a lower selling price to attract buyers.","42":"Determine the potential profit: Calculate the potential profit from selling each item by subtracting the winning bid price from the estimated value. Items with a larger potential profit may be more attractive to sell.","43":"Consider the time and effort required to sell: Selling an item takes time and effort, and some items may be more difficult to sell than others. Consider the time and resources required to sell each item and weigh this against the potential profit.","44":"Monitor the budget closely: Keep a close eye on the remaining budget and adjust bidding strategies accordingly. If the budget gets too low, consider dropping out of bidding wars for items with lower potential profit.","45":"Consider selling items in the secondary market: If an item is not sold during the auction, consider selling it in the secondary market to recover some of the investment. This can help free up budget for other items with higher potential profit.","46":"Be patient and strategic: The auction is a long process, and it's essential to be patient and strategic. Avoid getting caught up in bidding wars for items with low potential profit and focus on securing items with the highest potential profit.","47":"Monitor market conditions: Keep an eye on market conditions and adjust selling prices accordingly. If demand for an item increases, it may be possible to sell it for a higher price. Conversely, if demand decreases, it may be necessary to lower the selling price to attract buyers.","48":"Minimize selling costs: When selling items, minimize selling costs such as shipping, listing fees, and transaction fees to maximize profits. Consider using cost-effective selling platforms or negotiating shipping costs with buyers to save money.","49":"Monitor remaining budget: Keep track of your remaining budget after each winning bid or withdrawal from the auction. This will help you determine how much you can afford to bid on each high-potential item.","50":"Prioritize items based on potential profit: Once you have identified the high-potential items, prioritize them based on their potential profit. Bid on the items with the highest potential profit first, as this will maximize your overall profit from the auction.","51":"Avoid overbidding: Be careful not to overbid on items, as this can lead to a loss rather than a profit. Stick to your estimated value and only bid more if you are confident that the item's true value is higher.","52":"Identify items with a larger discrepancy between estimated value and starting price: To determine which items offer the greatest potential profit, it's essential to identify which items have a larger discrepancy between estimated value and starting price. This can be calculated by subtracting the starting price from the estimated value for each item.","53":"Consider the remaining budget and total profits: It's essential to consider the remaining budget and total profits when prioritizing items. Focusing on items with a larger difference between estimated value and starting price should not come at the expense of overspending the budget or missing out on items with a smaller difference but still significant potential profit.","54":"Evaluate the profitability of previously won items: By reviewing the profits earned by other bidders from previously won items, you can assess the potential profitability of the remaining items. This information can help you prioritize which items to focus on and how much to bid based on the potential profit.","55":"Identify the bidders with the lowest remaining budgets: By reviewing the current state of the auction, you can identify the bidders with the lowest remaining budgets. In this case, Bidder 1 has a total profit of $3500 and a remaining budget of $0, indicating that they have already spent their entire budget.","56":"Consider collaborating with other bidders: In some cases, it may be beneficial to collaborate with other bidders to split the cost of an item or share the profits. For example, if you and another bidder have similar estimated values for an item and compatible remaining budgets, you may want to consider collaborating to reduce your individual risk and increase your overall profits.","57":"Stay informed about the auction progress: By regularly reviewing the auction log, you can stay informed about the progress of the auction and adjust your bidding strategy accordingly. For example, if a particular item has attracted a lot of bidding activity, you may want to adjust your bidding strategy to avoid getting caught up in a bidding war.","58":"For each item with a mention of condition issues, estimate the impact of the condition on the item's true value and potential profit.: This may involve researching the typical value of similar items in good condition and comparing it to the item's true value with the mentioned condition issues.","59":"Adjust your bidding strategy for items with condition issues accordingly.: If the impact on the true value and potential profit is significant, consider bidding lower or dropping out of the bidding war altogether.","60":"Keep track of any condition issues for items you have already won and factor them into your resale strategy.: This may involve adjusting your asking price or offering discounts to buyers to account for the condition issues.","61":"Monitor the bidding behavior of other bidders for condition issues: Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other bidders for any signs of condition issues. If another bidder consistently bids lower than their estimated value on an item, it may be a sign that they have identified condition issues that are reducing the item's value. Conversely, if a bidder consistently bids higher than their estimated value on an item, it may be a sign that they have information about the item's condition that you don't have.","62":"Evaluate included accessories or warranties: Determine if any accessories or warranties are included with the item, as these can add value to the item and potentially increase its profit potential.","63":"Element R: {'Evaluate the specific features and capabilities': 'Evaluate the specific features and capabilities of this element, such as its durability, efficiency, or compatibility with other systems.', 'Consider the potential applications of this element': 'Consider the potential applications of this element and the industries that may have a high demand for it.'}","64":"Thingamajig C: {'Check for any unique features or capabilities': \"Check for any unique features or capabilities that could increase the item's true value and potential profit.

Take note of the severity and location of any damage, as it could impact the item's value.","71":"Test the item (if possible): If you're able to test the item before bidding, do so to ensure that it functions properly. This could involve turning on an appliance, checking the condition of a gadget's battery, or testing the fit of a mechanical part.","72":"Consult external resources: If you're unsure about the condition or value of an item, consult external resources such as online marketplaces, forums, or experts in the field. This can help you gain a better understanding of the item's value and any potential issues that could impact its worth.","73":"Set a maximum bid based on condition: Based on your inspection of the item's condition and your estimated value, set a maximum bid that reflects any potential discounts or deductions you may need to make due to the item's condition. This can help ensure that you don't overpay for an item that doesn't meet your expectations.","74":"Consider additional features: Additional features can add value to an item. For example, a gadget with a longer battery life or additional functions may be worth more than a similar gadget without these features. Similarly, an appliance with energy-saving features or a larger capacity may be worth more than a similar appliance without these features.","75":"Widget A: The starting price is $1000, and your estimated value is $2200. Given the difference between the starting price and estimated value, it may be worth bidding on this item, especially if you believe the condition and features justify the higher estimated value.","76":"Apparatus H: The starting price is $3000, and your estimated value is $6600. This represents a significant difference between the starting price and estimated value, making it a potentially profitable item to bid on.","77":"Determine the maximum bid: To maximize profit, you need to determine the maximum bid you are willing to place on each item while still staying within your budget. Given your estimated value of $11000 for each item and your remaining budget of $12398, you could consider bidding up to $10398 for either Unit Q or Machine P. This would leave you with a remaining budget of $1000 for the remaining items in the auction.","78":"Monitor the number of items won by each bidder: If a bidder has won a large number of items already, they may have a larger budget or be more aggressive in their bidding. In this case, it may be worth adjusting your strategy and focusing on other items where you have a better chance of winning.","79":"Consider bidding on one item and waiting for the other: Given the similar starting prices and estimated values for Unit Q and Machine P, it may be worth considering bidding on one item and waiting for the other to come up for auction at a later time. This could allow you to conserve your budget for other items and potentially secure a higher profit overall.","80":"Consider strategic bidding: If you notice that another bidder is consistently bidding on one of the items, you may want to consider bidding on the other item to force them to spend more of their budget on that item. This could potentially leave you in a better position to win the other item at a lower price.","81":"Determine the maximum bid: Given your estimated value of $8800 and your remaining budget of $8897, you can calculate your maximum bid for Mechanism J while ensuring that you don't exceed your budget. Your maximum bid should be less than or equal to $8800 - ($20000 - $6897) = $1903.","82":"Bid strategically: If you decide to bid on Mechanism J, consider bidding strategically to force other bidders out of the bidding war. You may want to bid higher than other bidders to increase the cost of the item for them and encourage them to drop out.","83":"Element R: The starting price is $5000, and your estimated value is $11000. Given the significant difference between the starting price and estimated value, it may be worth bidding on this item, especially if you believe the condition and features justify the higher estimated value.","84":"Thingamajig C, Doodad D, Gizmo F, and Implement G: The starting prices for these items are all lower than their estimated values, but the differences are not substantial enough to justify bidding on them based on this goal alone. However, it's essential to consider other factors, such as the remaining budget and potential profits from other items, before making a decision on these items.","85":"Consider the potential resale value: The potential resale value of an item is another factor to consider when evaluating its condition and features. If an item has the potential to retain its value or even increase in value over time, it may be worth investing in, even if the starting price is higher than the estimated value. For example, a rare or collectible item may be worth more in the future than its current estimated value.","86":"Consider the impact on overall budget: Finally, when evaluating the condition and features of an item, it's essential to consider the impact on the overall budget. If winning an item would significantly deplete the remaining budget, it may be worth passing on the item, even if the condition and features justify the price. Conversely, if the item fits within the remaining budget and offers a significant potential profit, it may be worth bidding on it.","87":"Assessing the seller's reputation: To assess the seller's reputation, you can look at their feedback and ratings from previous transactions. You can check if there are any red flags, such as consistently negative reviews or complaints about overpricing or shoddy items.","88":"Adjusting bidding strategy based on seller reputation: If you determine that the seller has a good reputation, you may be more willing to bid higher for their items, as you have a higher confidence that the item's true value is closer to their asking price. Conversely, if the seller has a poor reputation, you may want to be more cautious in your bidding and aim for lower prices to account for potential overpricing.","89":"Monitoring seller behavior: Keep an eye on the seller's bidding behavior and pricing strategy. If they consistently price items higher than their true value, you may want to avoid bidding on their items or adjust your bidding strategy accordingly.","90":"Collaborating with other bidders: If you notice that other bidders have a good reputation, you may want to consider collaborating with them to drive up the price of items with a high true value but a low starting price. This can help ensure that the item goes to a reputable seller and that you secure a good profit.","91":"Diversifying your bidding: To mitigate the risk of relying on a single seller, consider diversifying your bidding across multiple sellers with varying reputations. This can help you secure items with a good profit margin while minimizing the risk of overpaying for items from less reputable sellers.","92":"Assess the competition: Evaluating the competition and their bidding behavior can help you determine the true value of an item. For example, if multiple bidders are consistently bidding high on an item, it may indicate that the item's true value is higher than your estimated value.","93":"Adjust your estimated values as needed: As new information becomes available, it's essential to adjust your estimated values accordingly. This can help you make informed decisions about which items to bid on and how much to bid.","94":"Identify the average selling price, price range, and number of sales: Gather data on the average selling price, price range, and sales volume for each item to understand market demand and price trends.","95":"Compare estimated values and market research findings: Analyze the market research findings in comparison to the estimated values to assess potential profit and pricing accuracy.","96":"Regularly update market research and adjust bidding strategies: Continuously update market research and adapt bidding strategies to changing market conditions and demand.","97":"Consider other factors impacting item value: Take into account additional factors like condition, rarity, and demand when conducting market research and making bidding decisions.","98":"Seek expert opinions: Reach out to industry experts, professionals, or knowledgeable individuals who have experience with the items being auctioned. They may be able to provide valuable insights into the true value of an item based on their expertise.","99":"Analyze user reviews: Read user reviews and feedback from people who have previously owned or used the items. This can help you identify any potential issues or hidden costs associated with the items and adjust your estimated values accordingly.","100":"Consider the condition and age of the items: The condition and age of an item can significantly impact its true value. Be sure to factor in any wear and tear, as well as the age of the item, when estimating its value.","101":"Evaluate the rarity and uniqueness of the items: Items that are rare or unique may have a higher true value than their estimated value. Be sure to research the scarcity and demand for each item to ensure that your estimated values are accurate.","102":"Watch for patterns: Look for patterns in the bidding behavior of other bidders. For example, do they consistently bid high on certain types of items or bid aggressively in the early rounds? Understanding their bidding patterns can help you anticipate their moves and adjust your strategy accordingly.","103":"Stay flexible: Be prepared to adjust your strategy as the auction progresses. The bidding behavior of other bidders may change, and you may need to adapt to stay competitive. For example, if a bidder drops out of a bidding war, you may be able to win an item at a lower price than you anticipated.","104":"Identify items with the largest difference between starting price and estimated value: Based on the remaining items in the auction, Bidder 4 should focus on items with the largest difference between their starting price and estimated value. This can help maximize profits while staying within the remaining budget.","105":"Consider dropping out of bidding wars for items with a lower potential profit: If you notice that the bidding war for an item is heating up and the bids are approaching your maximum bid, consider dropping out if the potential profit for that item is relatively low compared to other items.","106":"Keep track of your total profits: Keep track of your total profits to ensure that you're making a profit overall. If you notice that your total profits are approaching your remaining budget, consider adjusting your bidding strategy to focus on items with a higher potential profit or dropping out of bidding wars for items with a lower potential profit.","107":"Stay informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest news and trends in the market for the items you're bidding on. This can help you make informed decisions about which items to bid on and how much to bid. For example, if you notice that the price of a particular item is trending upwards, you may need to increase your bid to stay competitive.","108":"Contraption I: With a starting price of $3000 and your estimated value of $6600, a reasonable maximum bid would be around $4800 to $5000, leaving some room for bidding on other items and potentially winning this item while still having enough budget for other items.","109":"Focus on items with a high potential profit: Given the current negative profit, it's essential to focus on items with a high potential profit to offset the loss from the Gadget B bid. In this case, the items with the highest potential profit are Unit Q, Element R, and Machine P, as they have the largest difference between their estimated value and starting price.","110":"Consider collusion between bidders: If you notice that two or more bidders consistently bid in tandem, it may be a sign of collusion. In this case, it may be worth adjusting your bidding strategy to avoid getting caught up in a collusive bidding war.","111":"Element R: {'Evaluate the true value': 'Compare it to the remaining budget and the potential profit of other items.', 'Consider bidding behavior': 'Adjust your bidding strategy accordingly.'}","112":"Compare the potential profit of Implement G to the potential profit of other items you have won: Based on the auction log, you have won the following items and their respective profits: Element R ($5501, $4691 profit), Gadget B ($2201, $2001 profit), Appliance O ($4200, $3800 profit), Widget A ($1201, $1001 profit), Apparatus H ($3501, $3101 profit), and Equipment E ($2701, $1701 profit). The total profit from these items is $15204.","113":"Consider the possibility of a lower or higher true value of Implement G: The true value of Implement G may be different from your estimated value. If the true value is lower than your estimated value, you may not make a profit or may even lose money if you bid the same amount as your estimated value. Conversely, if the true value is higher than your estimated value, you may make a larger profit than expected.","114":"Consider the importance of diversifying your portfolio: Winning a single item with a high potential profit may not be the best strategy if it means sacrificing the potential profit of other items. Diversifying your portfolio by bidding on a range of items with different potential profits can help mitigate the risk of overpaying for a single item.","115":"Doodad D: {'Evaluate the true value': 'Compare it to the starting price and the potential profit of other items.', 'Consider bidding behavior': 'Adjust your bidding strategy accordingly.'}","116":"Compare the potential profit of Gizmo F to other items: Review the list of items you have already won and their respective profits. Consider the potential profit of Gizmo F in relation to the remaining items in the auction and their starting prices and your estimated values.","117":"Bid strategically: Consider bidding strategically to force other bidders out of the bidding war on Gizmo F or other items. Determine the optimal bid amount based on your evaluation of the true value, potential profit, and remaining budget.","118":"Keep a backup plan: In case you miss out on an item you were interested in, it's essential to have a backup plan. This may involve focusing on other items with a higher potential profit or adjusting your bidding strategy to account for unexpected bidding behavior from other bidders.","119":"Prioritize items with lower risk: Focus on items with a lower risk of overspending, as these will provide a better chance of maximizing profits while staying within the budget.","120":"Monitor the bidding behavior of other bidders: Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other bidders for Implement G. If another bidder enters the bidding war, you may need to adjust your bidding strategy to maintain a profitable position.","121":"Evaluate the potential profit: Based on the current state of the auction, the potential profit from winning Implement G is $3235 ($6600 - $3365, where $3365 is the current highest bid). This potential profit is higher than the potential profit from the items you have already won, making it a potentially lucrative target.","122":"Avoid bidding on items with a low potential profit: Given your current budget and total profits, it may not be worth bidding on items with a low potential profit. In this case, it may be best to avoid bidding on items where the difference between your estimated value and starting price is small.","123":"Identify high-potential profit items: Based on the difference between your estimated value and the starting price, prioritize the remaining items with the largest potential profit. For example, Unit Q and Element R have the largest potential profit among the remaining items, with estimated values that are $7000 and $6000 higher than their starting prices, respectively.","124":"Adjust your strategy as needed: If your bidding strategy isn't working as well as you had hoped, be willing to adjust your strategy as needed. This may involve changing your maximum bid for an item, focusing on different items, or adjusting your bidding behavior based on the bidding behavior of other bidders.","125":"Consider the opportunity cost: Winning Element R at a higher price than your estimated value means that you will have less budget left for other items. Consider the opportunity cost of winning Element R at a higher price and whether it is worth it in the long run. If you miss out on Element R, you may be able to focus your budget on other items with a higher potential profit.","126":"Implement G: {'Set reasonable maximum bid': \"Given your estimated value of $6600 and your remaining budget of $695, a reasonable maximum bid for 'Implement G' would be around $3300 to $3500. This would allow you to win the item while still having enough budget left to bid on 'Gizmo F' and potentially other items in the auction.\", 'Adjust maximum bid based on competition': \"If you believe that other bidders may bid higher than $3500 for 'Implement G,' you may need to adjust your maximum bid accordingly to avoid overspending and running out of budget.\", \"Adjust maximum bid based on winning 'Gizmo F' at a higher price\": \"If you decide to bid on 'Gizmo F' first and win it at a price higher than your estimated value, you may need to adjust your maximum bid for 'Implement G' accordingly to stay within your remaining budget.\"}","127":"Gizmo F: Given the low starting price and your estimated value for Gizmo F, it may be worth bidding the full $4400 to secure the item, especially if you believe that other bidders may not value it as highly.","128":"Consider your remaining budget: Given your remaining budget of $695 and the starting price of Implement G at $3000, you will need to bid strategically to maximize your profit. If you bid the maximum of $6600 and win the item, your profit would be $3595. However, if you bid lower and lose the item, you would still have some budget left to bid on other items.","129":"Consider the true value of the items: While your estimated values can help guide your bidding decisions, it's important to keep in mind that the true value of each item may be different from your estimation. Consider the true value of each item when setting your maximum bid and when deciding whether to enter a bidding war.","130":"Determine the true value of Implement G: Use the revealed true values of the items won by other bidders to estimate the true value of Implement G. Look for patterns in the true values of the items that have been auctioned off so far and use that information to make an educated guess about the true value of Implement G.","131":"Evaluate the opportunity cost: Consider the opportunity cost of bidding on Implement G versus other items. If there are other items with a higher potential profit or a lower starting price, then it may be more profitable to focus on those items instead.","132":"Prioritize the items based on potential profit and true value: Based on the potential profit and the true value of the remaining items, prioritize which item to focus on. For example, if the potential profit of Gizmo F is higher than Implement G and its true value is also higher than Implement G, it may be a better option to focus on Gizmo F."}},"arms_cnt":{"Bidder 1":[],"Bidder 2":[],"Bidder 3":[],"Bidder 4":[1,5,20,28,42,56,61,79,84,92,103,113,123,126,129,133]},"model_info":{"Bidder 1":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 2":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 3":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 4":"mistral-7b-v0.2"}}
