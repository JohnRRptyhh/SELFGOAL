This can help you maximize your profits while minimizing your spending on items where the competition is too strong.\n - Focus on items with the highest potential profit: Based on the estimated values and the current budget, the following items have the greatest potential profit: Appliance O: Estimated value = $8800, Starting price = $4000, Potential profit = $4800, Machine P: Estimated value = $11000, Starting price = $5000, Potential profit = $6000, Utensil N: Estimated value = $8800, Starting price = $4000, Potential profit = $4800\n - Analyze the difference between estimated values and bids: Calculate the difference between each bidder's estimated value and their bids on each item. Bidders with a consistently large difference may be aggressive bidders trying to drive up the price.\n - Identify conservative bidders: Bidders who consistently bid below their estimated values may be more cautious or value their budget more than potential profit. These bidders may be worth targeting for items where they are bidding, as they may drop out of the bidding war earlier due to budget constraints.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $2299\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 4: $8299\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Gadget B: $2201\n    * Equipment E: $3500\n    * Element R: $6000\n    * Unit Q: $6000\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Adjust estimations based on competition: Use the information gathered from analyzing the competition to adjust your own estimations for each item. This can help you remain competitive while maximizing your profit potential.\n - Focus on items with the highest potential profit: Based on the estimated values and the current budget, the following items have the greatest potential profit: Appliance O: Estimated value = $8800, Starting price = $4000, Potential profit = $4800, Machine P: Estimated value = $11000, Starting price = $5000, Potential profit = $6000, Utensil N: Estimated value = $8800, Starting price = $4000, Potential profit = $4800\n - Determine the number of bidders who have placed bids on each item: {'For items where Bidder 4 has won (Gadget B, Equipment E, Element R, and Unit Q)': 'No other bidders have placed bids as they have all withdrawn after the first round.', 'For items where Bidder 4 has not bid (Appliance O, Apparatus H, Implement G, Thingamajig C, Utensil N, Machine P, Widget A, Mechanism J, Doodad D, and Gizmo F)': \"The number of bidders who have placed bids on each item can be determined by the number of unique bids placed in the first round, excluding Bidder 4's bid. For example, in the case of Appliance O, there were three bidders (Bidder 1, Bidder 2, and Bidder 3) who placed bids in the first round.\"}\n - Monitor the number of bidders in real-time: As new bidders enter the auction and place bids, Bidder 4 should keep track of the number of bidders for each item to ensure they continue to focus on items with fewer bidders.\n - Calculate the difference between your estimated value and the starting price for each item: Calculate the potential profit for each item by subtracting the starting price from your estimated value.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Utensil N:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $4200\n- Bidder 2: $4500\n- Bidder 3: $4200\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}.

If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format.
