Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Accurately estimating the true value of each item: By having a more precise understanding of the true value of an item, you can make informed decisions about when to bid and how much to bid, increasing the chances of winning an item at a lower price than its true value.\n - Monitoring other bidders' bidding patterns: Keeping track of other bidders' bidding behavior can help you determine their estimated values and potential strategies. This information can be used to adjust your own bidding strategy to maximize profit.\n - Prioritizing items with the greatest potential profit: Focus on items with the largest difference between your estimated value and the starting price.

Be mindful of your budget and avoid overspending on items that do not offer a significant potential profit.\n - Bidding strategically: Consider bidding in a way that forces other bidders to reveal their values, such as making small bids or bidding in increments that are not multiples of the minimum bid increment. This can help you gain valuable information about other bidders and potentially secure items at lower prices.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"As Bidder 4, you have a total budget of $20000.

Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Analyze historical data: Review past auction data for similar items to determine their average selling price and price trends. This information can help provide a more accurate estimate of the true value of the remaining items.\n - Evaluate the item's condition and uniqueness: Consider the condition and unique features of each item when estimating its true value. Items in better condition or with unique features may command higher prices.\n - Regularly evaluate your remaining budget and total profits: Keep track of your remaining budget and the profits you have earned from winning bids. This information can help you determine which items are worth bidding on and how much you can afford to bid.\n - Monitor your total spending: Keep track of your total spending and remaining budget throughout the auction. Avoid overspending on items that do not offer a significant potential profit, as this could put you at risk of running out of budget before the end of the auction.\n - Monitor other bidders' bidding patterns: Keep track of other bidders' bidding behavior and adjust your strategy accordingly. If a bidder is consistently bidding on high-value items, consider focusing on items with lower potential profit to avoid bidding wars.\n - Keep track of your total profits: Continuously update your total profits and adjust your bidding strategy accordingly to maximize overall profit.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Gizmo F:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $2500\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Manage your budget: Be mindful of your remaining budget and avoid overspending on items that do not offer a significant potential profit. With a budget of $1498, it is essential to focus on items that have a substantial difference between estimated value and starting price to maximize profit.\n - Evaluate the potential profit: Focus on items with a significant difference between your estimated value and the starting price, as these items have the potential for higher profits. However, be mindful of items with multiple potential buyers, as the competition may drive up the final price.\n - Monitor total spending: Keep a close eye on the total spending to ensure it remains below the budget of $20000. In the current state, the total spending is $15498, leaving a budget of $4502.\n - Assess the condition of each item: Inspect the auction descriptions or any available images to determine the condition of each item. Look for signs of wear, damage, or missing parts that could affect the item's value.\n - Evaluate the competition: Assess the competition for each item based on the bidding history and the number of remaining bidders. Focus on items where the competition is weak or uncertain, as these offer a better chance of securing a lower price than the estimated value.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Gadget B:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $1200\n- Bidder 2: $1200\n- Bidder 3: $1200\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Gadget B, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Gadget B. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.

With a budget of $1498, it is essential to focus on items that have a substantial difference between estimated value and starting price to maximize profit.\n - Evaluate the risk of losing an item: If the competition for a particular item is intense, consider the potential consequences of losing the item. For example, if losing an item would significantly impact your overall profit or hinder your ability to bid on other items, it may be worth increasing your bid to secure the item.\n - Monitor other bidders' bidding patterns: Keep an eye on other bidders' bidding behavior for the items with a large discrepancy between estimated value and starting price.
