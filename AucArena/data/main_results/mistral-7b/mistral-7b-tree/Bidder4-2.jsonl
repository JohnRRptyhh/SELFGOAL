This may involve setting a maximum bid for each item based on your estimated value and your remaining budget.\n - Prioritizing items based on their potential profit: Based on your estimated values and the starting prices of the items, you can prioritize which items to bid on based on their potential profit. Items with a large difference between their estimated value and starting price may offer the greatest potential profit, while items with a smaller difference may not be worth bidding on.\n - Keeping a backup plan: In case you miss out on an item you were interested in, it's essential to have a backup plan.

In this case, you should consider items like Appliance O, Utensil N, and Contraption I, as they have a moderate difference between their estimated value and starting price.\n - Manage your budget carefully: With a remaining budget of $17799, it's essential to manage your budget carefully to ensure that you don't overspend on any single item.

This means that you need to make up for this loss by winning items with a higher potential profit.\n - Focus on items with a difference of at least $1000 between estimated value and starting price: This threshold can be adjusted based on the remaining budget and the number of items left in the auction.

Focusing on items with a large difference between estimated value and starting price while also considering the remaining budget can help maximize profits while ensuring that there are enough items left to bid on.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Widget A:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $1200\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3: $1500\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

For example, the potential profit for Element R is $6000 ($11000 - $5000).\n - Monitor bidding behavior of other bidders: Keep track of the bidding behavior of other bidders to determine if they are consistently overpaying or underpaying for certain items. This information can help you adjust your estimated values to stay competitive or avoid bidding wars on items that may not be worth the investment.\n - Stay flexible and adapt to changing market conditions: The true value of an item can change based on market conditions, so it's essential to stay flexible and adapt your bidding strategy as needed. For example, if the price of an item starts to rise rapidly, it may be worth increasing your bid to secure the item at a lower price than its true value.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $5499\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $2800\n  * Bidder 4: $3499\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Apparatus H: $3200\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Gadget B: $2201\n    * Appliance O: $5500\n    * Utensil N: $6800\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

This difference can provide insight into how accurate your estimation was and help you adjust your estimated values for the remaining items.\n - Prioritizing items: Based on the hammer prices achieved for items won by other bidders, Bidder 4 may need to prioritize certain items over others. For instance, if Bidder 1 has won several high-value items, Bidder 4 may want to focus on items with lower hammer prices to maximize their profits.\n - Re-evaluate items with fewer bidders: Since there are fewer bidders for some items, such as Equipment E, Mechanism J, Thingamajig C, Doodad D, Gizmo F, and Implement G, it may be worth re-evaluating the estimated values for these items. If the starting prices are lower than your estimated values, you may be able to revise your estimated values downward to reflect the current auction dynamics.\n - Monitor remaining budget: Keep track of the remaining budget to ensure that it is sufficient to bid on the remaining items while staying within the overall budget of $20000.\n - Prioritize items with the highest potential profit: In this case, Element R and Machine P have the highest potential profit, so Bidder 4 may want to focus on these items first.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Equipment E:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3: $2500\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - In general: When re-evaluating the estimated values for items with fewer bidders, it's essential to consider the competition and the potential for securing the item at a lower price than your estimated value.

If you notice that a particular bidder is consistently bidding high on certain items, it may be a sign that those items have a higher true value than your estimated value, and you may want to adjust your bidding strategy accordingly.\n - Prioritize items with a large difference between estimated value and starting price: With a remaining budget of $5499 and 7 items left in the auction, it's essential to focus on items that offer the greatest potential profit. This means prioritizing items with a large difference between the estimated value and starting price.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - In general: When re-evaluating the estimated values for items with fewer bidders, it's essential to consider the competition and the potential for securing the item at a lower price than your estimated value. If the competition remains low, you may be able to revise your estimated value downward to reflect the current auction dynamics and increase your potential profit. However, if the competition heats up, you may need to adjust your bidding strategy accordingly to secure the item at the lowest possible price while staying within your budget.\n - Consider dropping out of the auction: If the remaining budget is not sufficient to bid on all the remaining items, it may be necessary to consider dropping out of the auction to conserve the remaining budget for future opportunities.\n - Prioritize items with the highest potential profit: In this case, Element R and Machine P have the highest potential profit, so Bidder 4 may want to focus on these items first.\n - Monitor the bidding behavior of other bidders closely: Keep track of the bidding behavior of other bidders to identify any trends or patterns. If you notice that a particular bidder is consistently bidding high on certain items, it may be a sign that those items have a higher true value than your estimated value, and you may want to adjust your bidding strategy accordingly.\n - Prioritize items with a large difference between estimated value and starting price: With a remaining budget of $5499 and 7 items left in the auction, it's essential to focus on items that offer the greatest potential profit. This means prioritizing items with a large difference between the estimated value and starting price. For example, Apparatus H, Unit Q, and Element R all have a difference of over $2000 between their estimated value and starting price, making them attractive options for bidding.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Mechanism J:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $5000\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

If other bidders are consistently bidding on the same items, it may be best to wait until they drop out before making a bid. Alternatively, if other bidders are not bidding on an item with a large difference between estimated value and starting price, it may be an opportunity to win the item at a lower price than expected.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Element R:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $5500\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
