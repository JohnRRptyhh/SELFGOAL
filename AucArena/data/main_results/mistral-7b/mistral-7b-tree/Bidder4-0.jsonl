Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Inspect the condition of each item: Before bidding on an item, it's essential to inspect its condition carefully. This may involve checking for any signs of wear, damage, or defects that could impact its value. For example, if an appliance has cosmetic damage or missing parts, it may be worth less than a similar appliance in excellent condition.\n - Compare the estimated value to the starting price: When evaluating the condition and features of an item, it's essential to compare the estimated value to the starting price. If the starting price is significantly lower than the estimated value, it may be worth bidding on the item, especially if the condition and features justify the higher estimated value. Conversely, if the starting price is significantly higher than the estimated value, it may be worth passing on the item.\n - Use multiple sources to estimate value: To get a more accurate estimation of an item's true value, consider using multiple sources of information, such as market research, expert opinions, and user reviews. This can help you refine your estimated values and reduce the risk of overpaying for an item.\n - Prioritize items with a higher potential profit: Given your remaining budget, focus on items with a larger difference between their starting price and your estimated value. This can help you maximize your profits while staying within your budget.\n - Set a maximum bid for each item based on your remaining budget and your estimated value: For example, for Appliance O with a starting price of $4000 and your estimated value of $8800, a reasonable maximum bid would be around $5800 to leave some room for bidding on other items.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Utensil N:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $4500\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

For example, if there is high demand for a particular item, its true value may be higher than your estimated value.\n - Review the auction log: Before inspecting each item, review the auction log to determine if any bidders have previously won items and if there were any issues reported with those items. This information can help you identify potential red flags and adjust your bidding strategy accordingly.\n - Inspect the item description: Carefully read the item description to understand its condition, features, and any included accessories or warranties. Look for any mentions of repairs, replacements, or returns, as these could impact the item's value.\n - Unit Q and Machine P: Both items have starting prices of $5000, and your estimated values are $11000 each. These items offer a substantial difference between the starting price and estimated value, making them attractive options for bidding.\n - Conduct market research: Look up the prices of similar items sold in the past on reputable online marketplaces or local sales platforms. This can help you get a better understanding of the market demand and the price range for each item.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Widget A:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $1100\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $1201\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Research market trends and demand for each item: Before the auction, research market trends and demand for each item to get a better understanding of their potential true value. Look for information on similar items sold in the past, current market prices, and any trends or factors that may impact the demand for the item.\n - Re-evaluate your estimated values: If market trends and demand shift, re-evaluate your estimated values for each item to ensure they are still accurate. If an item with a lower estimated value but high demand starts to rise significantly in price, consider revising your estimated value upwards to reflect the current market conditions.\n - Consider selling items with lower demand: If you have won an item with a higher estimated value but lower demand, consider selling it in the broader market to recoup some of your investment and free up budget for other items.\n - Prioritize items with a larger difference between estimated value and starting price: If market trends and demand shift, focus on items with a larger difference between your estimated value and the starting price. These items offer the greatest potential profit and are less likely to be affected by market trends and demand fluctuations.\n - Review the auction log for any mentions of condition issues: In the auction log, look for any bids or hammer prices that include mentions of damage, wear and tear, or repairs. This information can impact the item's true value and potential profit.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $12398\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $3500\n  * Bidder 4: $4398\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Gadget B: $2201\n    * Appliance O: $4200\n    * Widget A: $1201\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Evaluate the true value of Implement G: Compare your estimated value of $6600 to the starting price of $3000. Consider the potential profit of winning Implement G ($3600) and how it compares to the potential profit of other items you have won or are considering bidding on. Keep in mind that the true value of Implement G may be different from your estimated value, so be prepared for the possibility of a lower or higher true value.\n - Adjust bidding strategy for items with high risk: For items with a high risk of overspending, consider bidding conservatively to avoid overspending and focus on items with a lower risk of overspending.\n - Prioritize items with a large difference between estimated value and starting price: To maximize profit, focus on items where the difference between your estimated value and the starting price is significant. In this case, Gizmo F and Implement G both have a large difference between your estimated value and starting price, making them good potential targets for bidding.\n - Consider the true value of the remaining items: While evaluating the potential profit, it's essential to consider the true value of the remaining items. Based on the auction log, the true values of the items won by other bidders have been revealed. Use this information to make an informed decision about the potential profit of the remaining items.\n - Prioritize the items based on potential profit and true value: Based on the potential profit and the true value of the remaining items, prioritize which item to focus on. For example, if the potential profit of Gizmo F is higher than Implement G and its true value is also higher than Implement G, it may be a better option to focus on Gizmo F.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Gizmo F:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $2500\n- Bidder 2: $2500\n- Bidder 3: $2500\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Gizmo F, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Gizmo F. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Element R: {'Evaluate the true value': 'Compare it to the remaining budget and the potential profit of other items.', 'Consider bidding behavior': 'Adjust your bidding strategy accordingly.'}\n - Consider the possibility of a lower or higher true value of Implement G: The true value of Implement G may be different from your estimated value. If the true value is lower than your estimated value, you may not make a profit or may even lose money if you bid the same amount as your estimated value. Conversely, if the true value is higher than your estimated value, you may make a larger profit than expected.\n - Bid strategically: Consider bidding strategically to force other bidders out of the bidding war on Gizmo F or other items. Determine the optimal bid amount based on your evaluation of the true value, potential profit, and remaining budget.\n - Consider the opportunity cost: Winning Element R at a higher price than your estimated value means that you will have less budget left for other items. Consider the opportunity cost of winning Element R at a higher price and whether it is worth it in the long run. If you miss out on Element R, you may be able to focus your budget on other items with a higher potential profit.\n - Determine the true value of Implement G: Use the revealed true values of the items won by other bidders to estimate the true value of Implement G. Look for patterns in the true values of the items that have been auctioned off so far and use that information to make an educated guess about the true value of Implement G.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Implement G:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3500\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3: $3500\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1: $3800\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n\nRound 2:\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
