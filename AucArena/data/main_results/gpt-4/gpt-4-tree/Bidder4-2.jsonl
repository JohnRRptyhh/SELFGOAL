This will help us prioritize the items.\n\nHere's the potential profit margin for each item:\n\n1. Mechanism J: $8800 - $4000 = $4800\n2. Doodad D: $4400 - $2000 = $2400\n3.

Gadget B: $2200 - $1000 = $1200\n\nBased on the potential profit margin, we should prioritize items with the highest margins. However, we also need to consider the starting price and our budget. We don't want to spend too much of our budget on a few items and miss out on other profitable opportunities.\n\nGiven the budget of $20,000, we should aim to win at least 4-5 items to spread the risk and maximize the profit. We should prioritize items with a high profit margin and a lower starting price to ensure we can bid on multiple items.\n\nLet's assign priority levels based on the above analysis:\n\n- Priority 3: High profit margin and relatively low starting price.\n- Priority 2: Moderate profit margin or higher starting price.\n- Priority 1: Lowest profit margin or items that we can afford to lose if the price goes too high.\n\nHere's the priority assignment in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Machine P\": 3,\n  \"Element R\": 3,\n  \"Unit Q\": 3,\n  \"Mechanism J\": 2,\n  \"Utensil N\": 2,\n  \"Appliance O\": 2,\n  \"Implement G\": 2,\n  \"Contraption I\": 2,\n  \"Apparatus H\": 2,\n  \"Doodad D\": 2,\n  \"Equipment E\": 2,\n  \"Gizmo F\": 2,\n  \"Widget A\": 1,\n  \"Thingamajig C\": 1,\n  \"Gadget B\": 1\n}\n```\n\nIn this strategy, we're focusing on items with the highest profit margins (Machine P, Element R, Unit Q) as our top priority.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Prioritize High Margin Items: Focus on items where the difference between your estimated value and the starting price is greatest. These items offer a higher potential profit margin. For example, items with a starting price of $1000 and an estimated value of $2200 have a higher margin compared to items with a starting price of $4000 and an estimated value of $8800.\n - Spread Risk: Avoid putting all your budget into a single item. Instead, aim to win multiple items with reasonable bids to spread the risk and increase the chances of overall profit.\n - Avoid Bidding Wars: Engaging in bidding wars can lead to overpaying for an item. Set a firm limit and be prepared to withdraw if the price exceeds your calculated maximum bid.\n - Reserve Budget for Later Items: Don't exhaust your budget on the early items. There may be opportunities later in the auction to acquire items at a lower price as other bidders' budgets deplete.\n - Profit Calculation: Always calculate the potential profit before making a bid. If the current bid is approaching your estimated value, it may be time to withdraw to preserve your profit margin.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Doodad D:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $2500\n- Bidder 3: $2500\n- Bidder 4: $2100\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $2700\n\nRound 2:\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Set Maximum Bids: For each remaining item, determine a maximum bid that still allows for a profit margin. This maximum bid should be below your estimated value to ensure profit but also consider the remaining budget.\n - Avoid Overbidding: With a limited budget, it's crucial to avoid getting caught in a bidding war that would lead to overpaying for an item. Stick to the maximum bid guideline and be willing to withdraw if the price goes beyond it.\n - Calculate Running Profit Margins: After each item won, recalculate your total profit margins and adjust your strategy accordingly. If you are ahead, you might take a more conservative approach, whereas if you are behind, you might need to take calculated risks on certain items.\n - Target High-Value Items: Focus on items with a high estimated value that you can acquire within your budget. For example, items like Element R, Utensil N, and Unit Q have high estimated values and could yield significant profits.\n - Monitor Other Bidders' Budgets: Keep track of the remaining budgets of other bidders. If they have less budget left, they may be more conservative in their bidding, which could give you an advantage.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $10800\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n  * Bidder 4: $4800\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Doodad D: $2700\n    * Machine P: $6500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

This maximum bid should be below your estimated value to ensure profit but also consider the remaining budget.\n - Avoid Overbidding: With a limited budget, it's crucial to avoid getting caught in a bidding war that would lead to overpaying for an item. Stick to the maximum bid guideline and be willing to withdraw if the price goes beyond it.\n - Calculate Running Profit Margins: After each item won, recalculate your total profit margins and adjust your strategy accordingly. If you are ahead, you might take a more conservative approach, whereas if you are behind, you might need to take calculated risks on certain items.\n - Target High-Value Items: Focus on items with a high estimated value that you can acquire within your budget. For example, items like Element R, Utensil N, and Unit Q have high estimated values and could yield significant profits.\n - Monitor Other Bidders' Budgets: Keep track of the remaining budgets of other bidders.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1.

Avoid getting into bidding wars that could deplete your budget quickly.\n - Profit Margin Focus: Aim for items that offer a high potential profit margin. For instance, if the starting price of an item is $2,000 and your estimated value is $4,400, the potential profit margin is $2,400. Compare this to an item with a starting price of $5,000 and an estimated value of $11,000, which offers a potential profit margin of $6,000.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $4300\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $2500\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $1500\n  * Bidder 4: $8300\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Implement G: $3500\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * Equipment E: $2500\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Doodad D: $2700\n    * Machine P: $6500\n    * Element R: $6500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.
