This reduces the risk of walking away with nothing if you're outbid on a single high-stakes item.","1":"Adapt to Market Signals: Pay attention to the hammer prices (true values) of items that have been won. If these prices consistently differ from your estimates, adjust your valuations and bidding strategy accordingly.","2":"Avoid Emotional Bidding: Don't get emotionally attached to any item. If the price goes beyond your calculated maximum bid, be disciplined and withdraw. There will be other opportunities.","3":"Selective Bidding: Focus on items where the starting price is well below your remaining budget, allowing room for competitive bidding without exceeding your budget. This means you should primarily consider Widget A, Gadget B, and possibly Implement G, as they have starting prices within your budget range.","4":"Skip Utensil N: With a starting price of $4000, Utensil N is out of your budget range. Do not attempt to bid on this item, as doing so would exceed your available funds.","5":"Prepare for Post-Auction Sale: If you successfully purchase Gadget B, prepare to sell it at or near your estimated value to realize the profit. Research the best avenues for resale and consider any associated costs.","6":"Be Prepared to Withdraw: If the bidding for Gadget B goes beyond your break-even point of $2200, be prepared to withdraw from the bidding. It's better to walk away than to make a purchase that will result in a loss or exhaust your remaining funds.","7":"Final Item Strategy: Since Utensil N has a high starting price of $4000, which is beyond your remaining budget, you should not consider bidding on it. Your focus should be on Gadget B, and if possible, Implement G, but only if it stays within a profitable range.","8":"Bid on Gadget B: Consider bidding on Gadget B, which falls within your remaining budget and offers a potential profit. Make sure to stop bidding once the price approaches your remaining budget to avoid overspending.","9":"Consider the Auction Dynamics: As the auction progresses, other bidders may become more conservative with their bids or may have exhausted their budgets. This could reduce competition for the remaining items, potentially allowing you to secure an item at a lower price.","10":"Final Rounds Strategy: In the final rounds of the auction, be strategic and not show eagerness to bid, as this might encourage other bidders to drive up the price.","11":"Future Opportunities: With nine items left and a limited budget, consider passing on items that are less profitable to save funds for items that may have been undervalued by other bidders or where you can secure a better deal.","12":"Risk Management: Avoid spending all your budget on a single item unless you are confident in its resale value and profit margin. Diversifying your bids may reduce risk.","13":"Target Low Competition Items: Focus on items where the difference between your estimated value and the starting price is greatest, as these offer the potential for the highest profit.","14":"Quick Exit Strategy: Set a maximum bid for each item before the bidding starts, based on its estimated value and your remaining budget. If the bidding exceeds this limit, withdraw immediately to conserve funds for other opportunities.","15":"Profit Realization: Remember that your goal is to maximize profit, not necessarily to win the most items. Winning an item that does not contribute to your profit goal is counterproductive.","16":"Profit Margin Focus: Aim to bid on items where the difference between your estimated value and the starting price is greatest, offering potential for higher profit margins.","17":"Consider the Auction Dynamics: If other bidders have been consistently bidding high and winning items at prices close to your estimated values, they may be using similar valuation methods. Use this information to inform your bidding strategy for Gadget B.","18":"Reflect on the Auction Outcome: After the auction, take the time to reflect on the outcomes of your bids and the strategies of other bidders. This can provide valuable insights for future auctions.","19":"Future Opportunities: Remember that missing out on one item may lead to another opportunity with a better profit margin. Avoid overcommitting to a single item.","20":"True Value Consideration: Keep in mind that your estimated values might not reflect the true value. Track profits and adjust strategy accordingly.","21":"Risk Assessment: Assess the risk of each bid by considering the potential profit margin and the likelihood of other bidders driving the price up. Avoid getting into a bidding war that could deplete your remaining budget without a guaranteed profit.","22":"Profit Calculation: Since you cannot bid on the last item, your total profit remains at $11000. Your goal now is to ensure that this profit is not reduced by any means, such as penalties or additional costs.","23":"Observe Competitor Behavior: Even though you cannot participate in the bidding for Utensil N, observe the behavior of other bidders. This information might be useful for future auctions or for understanding the market value of similar items.","24":"Post-Auction Actions: Consider the next steps after the auction ends. This could involve preparing the items you've won for resale, finding buyers, and ensuring you sell them at or above your estimated value to realize the profits.","25":"Review and Learn: After the auction concludes, review your bidding strategy and the outcomes of each item auctioned. Analyze the bidding patterns of other participants and the final hammer prices to refine your strategy for future auctions.","26":"Market Research: Since you now have items to sell, conduct market research to determine the best channels and methods for selling the items you've acquired to maximize your actual profit.","27":"Networking: Use the opportunity at the auction's conclusion to network with other bidders and auction participants. Building relationships can lead to future opportunities or partnerships.","28":"Risk Assessment: You need to assess the risk of bidding on Gadget B. If the true value is less than your estimated value, you could end up with a smaller profit margin or even a loss. Since you currently have the highest total profit, it's crucial to consider whether the potential gain is worth the risk.","29":"Avoid Overbidding: Do not get caught up in a bidding war that would push the price of Gadget B beyond your remaining budget. Remember, you cannot spend more than $1000.","30":"Secure the Lead: You are currently trailing Bidder 3 by $300 in total profits. To surpass Bidder 3, you need to ensure that your profit from Gadget B exceeds this amount. Since the true value of Gadget B is $2000, you would need to win it for no more than $700 to take the lead. However, since your budget is $1000, you can bid up to that amount if necessary, but it's better to bid the minimum amount required to win.","31":"Final Bid Strategy: If the bidding goes above $1000, you must withdraw immediately. If the bidding stays below $1000, place your bids incrementally and be prepared to stop at $1000.","32":"Consider the Auction Dynamics: Since no one bid on Appliance O and Element R, it's possible that other bidders are also running low on funds or are being cautious. Use this to your advantage by being strategic with your bids on Gadget B.","33":"Market Value Consideration: Remember that the true value of the item may differ from your estimate. Since you won't know the true value until after the bidding, it's important to remain conservative in your bidding to avoid losses.","34":"Utensil N: {'Maximum Bid': 'Do not bid on this item as it is not possible to place a bid within the remaining budget.'}","35":"Final Item Caution: As the auction progresses to the last item, other bidders may become more desperate and bid more aggressively. Be particularly cautious with Utensil N, as its high starting price of $4000 is beyond your remaining budget.","36":"Assess Final Profit: Calculate your total profit from the items won by subtracting your winning bids from the true values of the items. This will give you a clear picture of your performance in the auction.","37":"Review Bidding Strategy: Reflect on your bidding strategy throughout the auction. Consider whether your estimations were accurate, if you bid too aggressively, or if you could have secured items at a lower price.","38":"Prepare for Resale: If the auction items are intended for resale, begin planning how to sell them for their true value or higher to realize your profit.","39":"Learn from Experience: Take note of any lessons learned during this auction, such as the importance of budget management, the need to avoid getting caught up in bidding wars, and the value of having a clear exit strategy.","40":"Plan for Future Auctions: If you plan to participate in future auctions, consider how you might adjust your strategy based on the outcomes of this one. This could involve setting stricter budget limits, improving your item value estimations, or being more selective about the items you bid on.","41":"Win Without Bidding: If no one bids on an item, and it is passed, consider whether you can negotiate a post-auction deal for any unsold items that may be profitable within your remaining budget.","42":"True Value Consideration: Remember that the hammer price reveals the true value of the items. Use this information to adjust your estimated values if you notice a pattern of overestimation or underestimation.","43":"Adapt to Market Dynamics: If you notice that items are consistently selling for less than their estimated value, adjust your bidding strategy to be more conservative. Conversely, if items are selling for more, consider increasing your maximum bid slightly, but always with a profit margin in mind.","44":"Endgame Strategy: As the auction nears its end, reassess your position. If you are behind in total profits, you may need to take calculated risks on the remaining items. If you are ahead, you might focus on preserving your lead by securing items with safe profit margins.","45":"Avoid Overbidding: Remember that the true value of the items may differ from your estimates. Avoid getting caught in a bidding war that could lead to overbidding and reduced profits.","46":"Consider Bargain Items: Some items may not attract high competition. Be prepared to bid on these if they can be acquired below your estimated value, thus securing a profit.","47":"Prioritize Affordable Items: With only $2300 left, focus on items that you can afford. Only consider bidding on items with a starting price within your remaining budget.","48":"Assess Your Financial Position: With only $1000 left in your budget, you cannot afford to bid on Utensil N, which has a starting price of $4000. Therefore, your primary goal is to abstain from bidding on this item.","49":"Review Budget Management: With the auction concluding, review how well you managed your budget throughout the process. Consider if there were opportunities to save more or if you missed out on items due to overly conservative bidding.","50":"Consider the Auction Dynamics: Since there are only two items left, including Gadget B, other bidders may also be conserving their budgets for the final item. This could either result in less competition for Gadget B or a more intense bidding war for Utensil N.","51":"Watch for Bargain Opportunities: If other bidders withdraw early, you might have the opportunity to secure Gadget B at a lower price than expected. Stay alert for such opportunities.","52":"Assess Risk vs. Reward: While Implement G and Utensil N have higher estimated values, they also have higher starting prices, which means they carry more risk given your limited budget. It may be more prudent to focus on the items with lower starting prices and less risk.","53":"Allocate Budget Wisely: If you win either Widget A or Gadget B, reassess your remaining budget before proceeding to bid on the next item. Ensure that you always have a buffer for unexpected opportunities or to cover any potential overestimation of the items' true values.","54":"Calculate Break-Even Points: For each item, determine the maximum bid you can make that allows you to break even based on the true value revealed in previous rounds. Do not exceed this bid to avoid losses.","55":"Maximize Return on Investment (ROI): Aim for items that offer the best ROI, which is the ratio of net profit to the cost of investment. Given your limited budget, securing items with the highest ROI should be a priority.","56":"Prepare for Final Opportunities: Keep some budget in reserve to take advantage of opportunities that may arise as other bidders deplete their budgets, potentially reducing competition for later items.","57":"Plan for the Long Game: With 11 items left, don't exhaust your budget too early. Keep enough funds to participate in bidding for items later in the auction, where competition may be less intense.","58":"Maintain a Poker Face: Avoid revealing your interest in specific items too early in the bidding process to prevent other bidders from driving up the price.","59":"Set a Maximum Bid Limit: Before the auction starts, determine the maximum amount you are willing to bid for each item based on its estimated value and your total budget. Do not exceed this limit under any circumstances.","60":"Opportunity Cost Consideration: Recognize that spending your budget on one item means you may not have enough funds for other potentially profitable items. Prioritize items based on their profit potential and your budget constraints.","61":"Post-Bid Analysis: After each bid, whether successful or not, analyze the outcome. If you won an item, ensure that the price paid is within your profit margin goals. If you were outbid, reflect on whether staying disciplined was the correct decision based on the hammer price.","62":"Monitor Competitor Behavior: Pay attention to the bidding patterns of other bidders. If they are aggressive, you may want to wait for other items where competition might be less fierce. If they are conservative, you might take the opportunity to secure items at lower prices.","63":"Identify Less Contested Items: Given that Bidder 3 has been aggressive on items with a starting price of $2000-$3000, it might be strategic to focus on items with a lower starting price where competition may be less intense, such as Widget A or Gadget B.","64":"Prioritize Items: With limited funds, you should prioritize items based on their potential profit margin and the likelihood of winning them at a price that still allows for profit.","65":"Consider Profit Margins: Always keep in mind the profit margin you aim to achieve. It's not just about winning an item but winning it at a price that allows for a reasonable profit.","66":"Final Rounds Strategy: As you approach the final items, reassess your strategy based on your remaining budget and the behavior of other bidders. If you have limited funds left, it may be wise to focus on a single item rather than spreading bids too thin.","67":"Skip Low Margin Items: Items like Apparatus H, Element R, and Utensil N have higher starting prices, which means they require a larger portion of the remaining budget and offer a lower profit margin relative to the budget. It may be wise to skip these items unless they can be acquired for significantly less than the estimated value.","68":"Adapt Strategy Based on Remaining Items: As the auction progresses, reassess the remaining items and adjust your strategy accordingly. If fewer items are left and they are less desirable, other bidders may also lower their aggressiveness, which could be an opportunity for you.","69":"Secure Quick Wins: If an item is not receiving much attention and you can secure it at a low price, consider making a winning bid to quickly add to your profits without depleting your budget significantly.","70":"Calculate Risk-Reward Ratios: For each item, weigh the potential reward against the risk of losing a significant portion of your remaining budget. Focus on items where the reward significantly outweighs the risk.","71":"Prepare for Final Items: As the auction nears its end, other bidders may become more desperate or conservative. Be ready to capitalize on this by having enough budget to bid on the final items, which may be acquired at lower prices if other bidders have exhausted their budgets.","72":"Manage Budget: With a remaining budget of $6200, it's crucial to bid wisely. Ensure that you have enough budget to bid on multiple items, rather than spending your entire budget on a single item.","73":"Dynamic Bidding Strategy: Adjust your bidding strategy based on the remaining budget, the number of items left, and the observed behavior of other bidders. If other bidders are running low on funds or have dropped out, you may be able to secure items at lower prices.","74":"Avoid High Starting Price Items: Items with starting prices close to or above your remaining budget, such as Apparatus H, Element R, and Utensil N, should be avoided. Bidding on these could deplete your funds quickly and leave you with no room to maneuver if the bidding goes above the starting price.","75":"Estimate Competition's Budget: If possible, try to gauge the remaining budgets of the other bidders. This can help you determine if they are likely to bid aggressively on the lower-priced items. If they have higher remaining budgets, they might focus on the more expensive items, leaving you with less competition for Widget A and Gadget B.","76":"Avoid Overbidding: Since you cannot win Element R or Utensil N with your current budget, do not engage in bidding for these items. This will conserve your funds for the items you can afford and prevent you from being drawn into a bidding war that you cannot win.","77":"Assess True Value During Bidding: If an item's bidding is going slow and you suspect the item might sell for less than its true value, you might consider bidding slightly above your initial maximum bid, but only if the potential profit margin justifies the risk.","78":"Monitor True Values: Keep track of the hammer prices and compare them with your estimated values. If your estimates are consistently higher or lower than the true values, adjust your estimated values accordingly for the remaining items.","79":"Consider the Number of Remaining Items: With 12 items left and a budget of $18,700, you have an average of approximately $1,558 to spend per item if you were to win every item at your maximum bid. However, since this is not realistic, you should aim to spend less on some items to have the flexibility to bid higher on others.","80":"Adjust for True Value Discovery: As the auction progresses, you may gain insights into the true value of items based on hammer prices. Adjust your estimated values and maximum bids accordingly.","81":"Be Prepared to Walk Away: If the bidding exceeds your maximum bid, be prepared to walk away from the item. There will be other opportunities, and it's important to maintain discipline to maximize overall profit.","82":"Assess Remaining Budget: With only $6200 left, prioritize items that offer the highest potential profit margin within your budget constraints.","83":"Consider the Order of Items: Since the items are presented sequentially, plan your bidding strategy based on the order in which the items come up for auction. If an item later in the sequence has a higher potential profit, it may be wise to conserve budget for that item.","84":"Consider the Number of Items Left: Focus on winning a few items with the highest profit margin rather than spreading your budget too thin, considering there are nine items left and a limited budget.","85":"Be Strategic with Bidding: Hold back and wait for items that others may overlook or have less interest in if you notice other bidders are aggressive on certain items.","86":"Risk Assessment: Be aware of the uncertainty in your estimated values. Since the true value might differ from your estimates, consider a safety margin in your bids to account for potential overestimations.","87":"True Value Revelation: Pay attention to the revealed true values of items as they are sold. This information can help you adjust your estimates for similar items coming up and refine your bidding strategy.","88":"Assess Competition Behavior: Notice patterns in the bidding behavior of other participants. If certain bidders are aggressive or tend to drop out early, use this information to your advantage in future rounds.","89":"Prioritize High-Value Items: Focus on items where the estimated value significantly exceeds the starting price, as these offer the potential for higher profit margins. For example, items with a starting price of $3000 but an estimated value of $6600 should be prioritized over items with a smaller margin.","90":"Re-evaluate Item Values: As the auction progresses, re-assess the estimated values of the remaining items. Market dynamics during the auction could affect their true value.","91":"Stay Alert for Bargains: Be on the lookout for items that other bidders may overlook or undervalue, which could be acquired at a bargain price.","92":"Keep a Cool Head: Emotional bidding can lead to overspending. Stick to your calculated limits and strategies, and don't let the heat of the moment dictate your actions.","93":"Avoid Bidding Wars: Engaging in bidding wars can quickly deplete your budget and reduce your profit margin. If the price approaches your maximum bid, be prepared to withdraw and focus on other items.","94":"Calculate Profit Margins: Always calculate the potential profit margin before making a bid. If the margin is too low, it may not be worth the risk, especially with a limited budget.","95":"True Value Consideration: Keep in mind that your estimated value might differ from the true value. If the auction log shows a pattern where true values are consistently lower than your estimates, adjust your maximum bids accordingly to avoid overpaying.","96":"Reserve Budget for Later Rounds: As the auction progresses, other bidders may deplete their budgets, which could lead to less competition and lower final bids for items. Keeping some budget reserved for later rounds could be a strategic move.","97":"Monitor Profit Margins: Always aim to maintain a healthy profit margin. If the margin is too thin, the risk may not be worth the potential gain, especially if there's uncertainty about the true value.","98":"Review Auction Dynamics: As the auction progresses, review how the dynamics are changing. Are items selling for more or less than their starting prices? Adjust your strategy accordingly.","99":"Stay Objective: Do not let emotions drive your bidding. Stick to your pre-determined maximum bids and budget allocation strategy to avoid making impulsive decisions that could negatively impact your profit.","100":"Value Assessment: Continuously assess the estimated value of each item against the current bid and the behavior of other bidders to determine if the item is still a profitable investment.","101":"Conserve Budget for Best Opportunities: If the next few items do not offer good profit margins or are likely to exceed your budget, conserve your funds for later items where you might have a better chance to bid and win at a profitable price.","102":"Bid Conservatively: Since your budget is limited, you need to bid carefully to avoid being outbid and losing the opportunity to bid on other items. Set a maximum bid limit for each item based on your estimated value and the need to maintain a profit margin.","103":"Be Prepared to Withdraw: If the bidding goes beyond a point where the potential profit margin is too low or negative, be prepared to withdraw from that item to conserve funds for other opportunities.","104":"Monitor Competition: Keep track of the remaining budgets and bidding patterns of other bidders. If a bidder is running low on funds or tends to bid aggressively, adjust your strategy accordingly.","105":"Learn from Past Auctions: Reflect on the hammer prices of past items and compare them with your estimated values. If your estimates are consistently higher or lower than the true values, adjust your future estimates and bidding strategy accordingly.","106":"Consider Opportunity Cost: When deciding whether to bid on an item, consider the opportunity cost. Winning an item means you'll have less budget for future items, which might offer better profit potential.","107":"Bid Increment Strategy: Decide on a bid increment strategy that allows you to stay in the auction without overbidding. You might choose to increase your bids in small increments to avoid escalating the price too quickly.","108":"Drop Out Early if Necessary: If the bidding for an item approaches or exceeds your estimated value, be prepared to drop out of the bidding. It's better to let an item go than to win it at a price that doesn't allow for a profit.","109":"Resale Value Consideration: Remember that your estimated value is not necessarily the true resale value. Be conservative with your estimates to account for potential overestimation.","110":"Opportunistic Bidding: Be ready to take advantage of opportunities when other bidders act irrationally or when an item you value highly is not attracting high bids.","111":"Maintain Budget Discipline: Keep track of your remaining budget and ensure that you have enough funds to bid on items later in the auction that may have less competition and therefore a higher profit potential.","112":"Adjust Strategy Based on Progress: If you win an item, recalculate your budget and adjust your strategy for the remaining items. If you haven't won any items after several rounds, you may need to be more aggressive to ensure you don't end the auction with your budget unspent.","113":"Avoid Direct Competition with Bidder 3: If Bidder 3 starts bidding on an item, consider whether it's worth engaging in a bidding war. Given your budget constraints, it might be more prudent to let Bidder 3 have the item if the price goes beyond a certain threshold.","114":"Watch Other Bidders: While focusing on Bidder 3, don't ignore the actions of Bidders 1 and 2. They may have been inactive so far but could become more aggressive as the auction progresses.","115":"Predict Bidder 3's Valuation Strategy: Bidder 3 seems to bid on items where they see a good margin between the bid price and the true value. They may be using a similar estimation strategy to yours or have a different method for valuing items.","116":"Consider Bidder 3's Drop-Out Point: Bidder 3 has shown a willingness to withdraw from bidding when the price goes beyond a certain point. If you can determine this threshold, you can decide whether to push the bid just beyond it to win an item or let Bidder 3 take it if it goes too high.","117":"Strategize Based on Remaining Items: Given the remaining items and your budget, decide which items you want to focus on. If Bidder 3 has been aggressive on items with a higher starting price, they might go for Machine P or Element R. You could focus on items with a lower starting price like Widget A or Gadget B to conserve budget and maximize profit.","118":"Prepare for the Long Game: With 10 items left and a budget of $10,000, you need to average a winning bid of $1,000 per item to buy all remaining items, which is not feasible given the starting prices. Prioritize items based on potential profit and be prepared to let some go if the price exceeds your valuation.","119":"Estimate Bidder 3's Remaining Budget: Since Bidder 3 has won two items at $4500 and $2700, their total expenditure is $7200. If they started with a similar budget as you, their remaining budget could be estimated by subtracting their expenditure from the initial amount.","120":"Identify Items of Interest: Determine which of the remaining items might be of high interest to Bidder 3 based on their past bids. They may target items with a higher potential profit margin or items similar to what they have already bid on.","121":"Monitor Bidder 3's Aggressiveness: Pay attention to how quickly Bidder 3 raises their bids. If they tend to jump to high bids quickly, they may be trying to intimidate other bidders. Use this information to decide whether to compete or withdraw from bidding on certain items.","122":"Look for Patterns in Withdrawals: Notice when Bidder 3 decides to withdraw from bidding. This could indicate their budget constraints or lack of interest in certain items, which you can use to your advantage.","123":"Maintain Profit Focus: While winning an item can be satisfying, always keep the end goal in mind\u2014maximizing profit. Winning an item for the sake of winning, especially if it results in a low or negative profit margin, is counterproductive.","124":"Monitor Remaining Items: Keep an eye on the items yet to be auctioned and their potential value to you. Some items may be more desirable to other bidders, and you can use this to your advantage by focusing on items that are less contested.","125":"Bid Timing: Determine the optimal time to enter the bidding or to increase your bid, possibly waiting for other bidders to reach their maximum before you bid.","126":"Competition Analysis: Observe and analyze the bidding patterns of your competitors to predict their behavior and adjust your strategy accordingly.","127":"Loss Minimization: Set a maximum bid limit for each item based on its estimated value to avoid overbidding and incurring a loss.","128":"Balance Risk and Reward: While diversification is important, also consider the risk associated with each item. If an item's true value is uncertain or could be lower than your estimate, be more conservative with your bid.","129":"Bid on Undervalued Items: Look for items that other bidders may undervalue or overlook. Winning such items at a low price can contribute to your overall profit without significantly depleting your budget.","130":"Keep Track of Profits: Always keep in mind your current profit and how each potential bid could increase it. Your goal is to maximize profit, not necessarily to win the most items.","131":"Auction Dynamics: Be adaptable to the auction dynamics, as the behavior of other bidders and the progression of the auction may require you to adjust your strategy.","132":"Selective Bidding: Focus on items where the estimated value significantly exceeds the starting price, as these offer the potential for higher profit margins. Be selective and bid on items that align with this criterion.","133":"Target Less Popular Items: Some items may attract less interest from other bidders. Identify these items and target them, as you may be able to secure them at prices closer to their starting bids.","134":"Profit Calculation: Continuously calculate the potential profit for each item based on your estimated value and the current bid. Only bid up to the point where you can still make a reasonable profit.","135":"Reserve Budget for High-Value Items: If there are items later in the auction that you highly value, reserve a portion of your budget specifically for those items. This ensures you can bid competitively when they come up.","136":"Flexibility: Be ready to adapt your strategy based on how the auction unfolds. If you notice that items are consistently going for higher than expected, reassess the estimated values of remaining items and adjust your maximum bids accordingly.","137":"Budget Allocation: Allocate your remaining budget to items where you can make the most significant profit. This might mean bidding on fewer items but ones where the margin is higher.","138":"Profit Tracking: Keep a running total of your profits to ensure that each bid contributes positively to your overall profit margin.","139":"Assess Remaining Items: Look at the potential profit margin of the remaining items. Focus on items where the starting price is within your budget and where you have a high estimated value, ensuring a good profit margin.","140":"Keep an Eye on the True Value: Use the true value of items revealed after each sale to adjust your estimates for similar items that are coming up.","141":"Final Push: If you reach the last item and it has a high potential profit margin, consider using your remaining budget to make a strong bid, but only if it's within the estimated value and allows for a profit.","142":"Future Item Valuation: Consider the estimated values of the remaining items. If there are items with a high estimated value coming up, it may be wise to conserve funds to have a competitive edge when those items are auctioned.","143":"Bid Withdrawal Timing: Know when to withdraw from bidding. If the price approaches or exceeds your estimated value, it's time to step back to avoid a negative profit scenario."}},"arms_cnt":{"Bidder 1":[],"Bidder 2":[],"Bidder 3":[],"Bidder 4":[1,11,30,41,52,64,76,88,94,98,105,110,113,122,129,144]},"model_info":{"Bidder 1":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 2":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 3":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 4":"gpt-4-1106-preview"}}
