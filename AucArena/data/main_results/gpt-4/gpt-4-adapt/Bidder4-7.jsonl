If you cannot bid on Appliance O, then focus on Apparatus H if the auction conditions allow.\n\nYour strategy should be to monitor the auction closely. If the auctioneer allows bids below the starting price and the other bidders do not immediately bid up to the starting price, you may have a chance to secure one of the items within your budget.

This indicates that Bidder 1 is willing to compete and push for items they are interested in, and they seem to have a good sense of the item's value or are willing to take risks.\n- Bidder 2: Matched the initial bid of $5000 but withdrew after the first round when the bid was raised to $5400. This suggests that Bidder 2 is more conservative or has a lower estimation of the item's value.\n- Bidder 3: Withdrew immediately, indicating either a lack of interest in Appliance O or a strategic decision to conserve budget for other items.\n- Bidder 4 (You): Also withdrew immediately, which could be due to a strategic budget allocation or a lower valuation of the item.\n\nGiven the outcome of the auction for Appliance O, here is the updated status in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 2100,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 8600,  \/\/ Previous profit of $6000 plus the profit from Appliance O ($8000 - $5400 = $2600)\n    \"Bidder 2\": 0,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 4000\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Contraption I\": 3500,\n      \"Mechanism J\": 4500,\n      \"Appliance O\": 5400\n    },\n    \"Bidder 2\": {},\n    \"Bidder 3\": {\n      \"Element R\": 6000\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the total profits for Bidder 1 have been updated to include the profit from winning Appliance O.
