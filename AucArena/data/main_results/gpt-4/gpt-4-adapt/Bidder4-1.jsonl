Estimated Value vs. Starting Price: Items with a higher difference between your estimated value and the starting price may offer a greater potential profit margin.\n2. Budget Allocation: With a total budget of $20,000, you need to ensure you don't overspend on any single item, keeping in mind there are 15 items in total.\n3. Priority Setting: Assigning priorities based on potential profit margins and personal estimations will help you decide where to focus your bidding efforts.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's assign priorities:\n\n- High Priority (3): Items with a high estimated value compared to their starting price, offering a significant potential profit margin.\n- Medium Priority (2): Items with a moderate estimated value compared to their starting price, offering a reasonable potential profit margin.\n- Low Priority (1): Items with a lower estimated value compared to their starting price, offering the least potential profit margin or items that may not be worth the risk of depleting your budget early on.\n\nNow, let's assign priorities to each item:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Mechanism J\": 2,\n  \"Utensil N\": 2,\n  \"Gadget B\": 3,\n  \"Doodad D\": 3,\n  \"Implement G\": 2,\n  \"Contraption I\": 2,\n  \"Element R\": 2,\n  \"Widget A\": 3,\n  \"Equipment E\": 3,\n  \"Machine P\": 2,\n  \"Gizmo F\": 3,\n  \"Appliance O\": 2,\n  \"Unit Q\": 2,\n  \"Thingamajig C\": 3,\n  \"Apparatus H\": 2\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- Items \"Gadget B\", \"Doodad D\", \"Widget A\", \"Equipment E\", \"Gizmo F\", and \"Thingamajig C\" are given the highest priority because they have a high potential profit margin and relatively low starting prices, which means you can bid on these items more aggressively while still maintaining a good chance of a high return on investment.\n- Items \"Mechanism J\", \"Utensil N\", \"Implement G\", \"Contraption I\", \"Element R\", \"Machine P\", \"Appliance O\", \"Unit Q\", and \"Apparatus H\" are given a medium priority. They have good potential profit margins, but their higher starting prices mean you should be more cautious with your bidding to avoid overspending.\n- No items are assigned the lowest priority in this case, as all items have a decent potential profit margin. However, if the auction becomes too competitive and prices soar beyond reasonable levels, you should be prepared to drop out of the bidding for medium-priority items to conserve your budget for higher-priority items.\n\nRemember, this strategy is dynamic and should be adjusted based on the behavior of other bidders and the flow of the auction.

Then, update the status JSON regarding the following information:\n- 'remaining_budget': The remaining budget of you, expressed as a numerical value.\n- 'total_profits': The total profits achieved so far for each bidder, where a numerical value following a bidder's name. No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}. If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format.

Your remaining budget is $15100, and your total profit so far is $3100.\n\nTo update the priority list, consider the following:\n\n1. You have already made a purchase, so your remaining budget is reduced.\n2. Other bidders have not won any items yet, which means they still have their full budgets and may bid more aggressively on upcoming items.\n3.

Your total profit is $7000, assuming your estimated values are accurate reflections of the true values. Your remaining budget is $11000.\n\nWith a reduced budget and increased profits, your strategy should now focus on securing items that offer a high return on investment without exhausting your remaining funds. You should also be mindful of the competition, as other bidders still have their full budgets and may drive up prices.\n\nLet's update the priorities based on the new information:\n\n- High Priority (3): Items with a low starting price and a high estimated value, which could yield a significant profit margin.\n- Medium Priority (2): Items with a moderate starting price and estimated value, which could still offer a good profit but may require more careful bidding.\n- Low Priority (1): Items with a high starting price relative to your remaining budget, which could deplete your funds and reduce your ability to bid on other items.\n\nHere's the updated priority list in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Gadget B\": 3,\n  \"Doodad D\": 3,\n  \"Implement G\": 2,\n  \"Contraption I\": 2,\n  \"Element R\": 1,\n  \"Widget A\": 3,\n  \"Equipment E\": 3,\n  \"Machine P\": 1,\n  \"Gizmo F\": 3,\n  \"Appliance O\": 2,\n  \"Unit Q\": 1,\n  \"Thingamajig C\": 3,\n  \"Apparatus H\": 2\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- Items \"Gadget B\", \"Doodad D\", \"Widget A\", \"Equipment E\", \"Gizmo F\", and \"Thingamajig C\" are high priority due to their low starting prices and relatively high estimated values, which could result in substantial profits without risking too much of your remaining budget.\n- Items \"Implement G\", \"Contraption I\", \"Appliance O\", and \"Apparatus H\" are medium priority. They have higher starting prices, but their estimated values suggest a decent profit margin. You should bid with caution and be ready to withdraw if the price escalates too much.\n- Items \"Element R\", \"Machine P\", and \"Unit Q\" are low priority. Their high starting prices pose a significant risk to your remaining budget, and winning these items could prevent you from bidding on other, potentially more profitable items.\n\nAs the auction progresses, continue to monitor the behavior of other bidders and adjust your strategy accordingly. Your goal is to maximize your profit while minimizing risk, so be prepared to let go of items if the price exceeds their estimated value or if it jeopardizes your ability to bid on future items."},{"human":"Now, the auctioneer says: \"Attention, bidders! 13 item(s) left, they are: Gadget B, Doodad D, Implement G, Contraption I, Element R, Widget A, Equipment E, Machine P, Gizmo F, Appliance O, Unit Q, Thingamajig C, Apparatus H.\n\nNow, please bid on Gadget B.
