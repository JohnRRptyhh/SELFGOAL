Priority Setting: Assigning priority levels will help you decide when to bid aggressively and when to hold back.\n\nGiven the estimated values and starting prices, let's calculate the potential profit margin for each item:\n\n1.

Estimated Value vs. Starting Price: Items with a higher difference between your estimated value and the starting price may offer a greater potential profit margin.\n2. Budget Allocation: With a total budget of $20,000, you need to ensure you don't overspend on any single item, leaving enough funds to bid on multiple items.\n3. Priority Setting: Assigning priority levels will help you decide when to bid aggressively and when to hold back.\n\nGiven the estimated values and starting prices, let's calculate the potential profit margin for each item:\n\n1. Appliance O: Estimated Value - Starting Price = $8800 - $4000 = $4800\n2. Contraption I: $6600 - $3000 = $3600\n3. Machine P: $11000 - $5000 = $6000\n4. Equipment E: $4400 - $2000 = $2400\n5. Gizmo F: $4400 - $2000 = $2400\n6. Unit Q: $11000 - $5000 = $6000\n7. Mechanism J: $8800 - $4000 = $4800\n8. Thingamajig C: $2200 - $1000 = $1200\n9. Gadget B: $2200 - $1000 = $1200\n10.

Utensil N: $8800 - $4000 = $4800\n\nNow, let's assign priorities based on the potential profit margin and the starting price:\n\n- Priority 3: Items with the highest potential profit margin and a reasonable starting price. These are the items you should focus on winning.\n- Priority 2: Items with a moderate profit margin. You could bid on these if the auction for higher-priority items doesn't exhaust your budget.\n- Priority 1: Items with the lowest profit margin or items that may not be worth the risk given their starting price.\n\nBased on this, here's the priority list in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Machine P\": 3,\n  \"Unit Q\": 3,\n  \"Element R\": 3,\n  \"Appliance O\": 2,\n  \"Mechanism J\": 2,\n  \"Utensil N\": 2,\n  \"Contraption I\": 2,\n  \"Implement G\": 2,\n  \"Apparatus H\": 2,\n  \"Equipment E\": 1,\n  \"Gizmo F\": 1,\n  \"Doodad D\": 1,\n  \"Thingamajig C\": 1,\n  \"Gadget B\": 1,\n  \"Widget A\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThis strategy focuses on securing the items with the highest potential profit while maintaining budget discipline.

You should aim to secure these items if you can get them at a price that allows for a good profit margin.\n\n3. **Moderate-Value Items**: Mechanism J, Implement G, Apparatus H, and Utensil N offer decent profit margins and may be less contested than the highest-value items.\n\n4. **Lower-Value Items**: Equipment E, Gizmo F, Doodad D, Thingamajig C, Gadget B, and Widget A have lower starting prices and estimated values, which means they could be good opportunities to secure additional profits without risking too much of your budget.\n\n5. **Competition**: Other bidders have not yet won any items, which could lead to increased competition for the remaining items. It's important to avoid bidding wars that could reduce your profit margins.\n\nBased on these considerations, here's the updated priority list:\n\n- Priority 3: Items that offer high potential profits and are still within reach given your remaining budget.\n- Priority 2: Items with moderate potential profits that you can bid on if the price remains reasonable.\n- Priority 1: Items with lower potential profits that you can afford to lose or bid on opportunistically if they remain at a low price.\n\nHere's the updated priority list in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Machine P\": 3,\n  \"Unit Q\": 3,\n  \"Element R\": 3,\n  \"Mechanism J\": 2,\n  \"Implement G\": 2,\n  \"Apparatus H\": 2,\n  \"Utensil N\": 2,\n  \"Equipment E\": 1,\n  \"Gizmo F\": 1,\n  \"Doodad D\": 1,\n  \"Thingamajig C\": 1,\n  \"Gadget B\": 1,\n  \"Widget A\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThe priority list reflects a focus on the items with the highest potential profit while still considering the risk of depleting your budget.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget."},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Equipment E:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $2500\n- Bidder 2: $2500\n- Bidder 3: $2500\n- Bidder 4: $2100\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $2700\n\nRound 2:\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Since Gizmo F is not a top priority (it was assigned a priority 2 in the previous analysis), and given the risk of exhausting your budget, it would be prudent to either place a single bid at the starting price or withdraw entirely.\n\nFinal Decision:\nSince the starting price is very close to your remaining budget, and to maintain a buffer for other potential opportunities, it's safer to withdraw from bidding on Gizmo F.\n\n\"I'm out!\"","tag":"bid_4"},{"messages":[{"system":"You are Bidder 4, who is attending an ascending-bid auction as a bidder.
