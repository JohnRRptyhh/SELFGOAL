The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget."},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Gadget B:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Gadget B, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Gadget B. \nAs Bidder 2, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.

If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"In this round of bidding, Bidder 3 won Utensil N at a price of $5000, which is lower than the true value of $8000. Bidder 1 withdrew from the bidding, and Bidder 4 also withdrew after placing a bid.\n\nHere's the updated status:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 16200,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 11900,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 2200,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 0\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Unit Q\": 6000,\n      \"Mechanism J\": 4900,\n      \"Element R\": 5200\n    },\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\n      \"Implement G\": 3800\n    },\n    \"Bidder 3\": {\n      \"Utensil N\": 5000\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
