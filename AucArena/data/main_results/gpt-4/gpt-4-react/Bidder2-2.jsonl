If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"In this round of bidding:\n\n- Bidder 1 initially bid $1500, then increased to $1700 before withdrawing.\n- Bidder 2 initially bid $1100 and then withdrew.\n- Bidder 3 initially bid $1200 and then withdrew.\n- Bidder 4 entered the bidding in round 0 with a bid of $1050, then won the item with a final bid of $1800.\n\nBased on this, the updated status is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 15500,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 2\": 3500,\n    \"Bidder 4\": 0\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\n      \"Utensil N\": 4500\n    },\n    \"Bidder 4\": {}\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
