If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"In this round of bidding, Bidder 1 won Implement G at a price of $3800, which is higher than the true value of $6000. Bidder 2 withdrew from the bidding at this point.\n\nBased on this information, the updated status is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 16800,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 4000,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 2800\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\n      \"Apparatus H\": 3200\n    },\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Implement G\": 3800\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
