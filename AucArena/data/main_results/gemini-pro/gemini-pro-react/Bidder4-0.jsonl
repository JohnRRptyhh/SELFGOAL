I will also be willing to bid on the items that I have prioritized as 2, but I will be more cautious and will only bid up to my budget.\n\n**Specific Item Strategies:**\n\n* **Mechanism J:** This is my top priority item.

I will bid aggressively on this item, but I am not willing to go as high as my budget as I am for Mechanism J.\n* **Contraption I:** This is a lower-priority item. I will only bid on this item if the price is right.\n* **Implement G:** This is a lower-priority item. I will only bid on this item if the price is very low.\n* **Equipment E:** This is a low-priority item. I am not interested in winning this item.\n* **Thingamajig C:** This is a low-priority item. I am not interested in winning this item.\n* **Doodad D:** This is a low-priority item. I am not interested in winning this item.\n* **Gizmo F:** This is a low-priority item. I am not interested in winning this item.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\nI will also keep an eye on Bidder 2's and Bidder 3's bidding behavior. If they start to bid aggressively on an item that I am not interested in, I may consider dropping out of that bidding war to save my budget for the items that I am more interested in.\n\nI am also aware that Bidder 3 has won Machine P for $5500.

Remember, Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some common practices of bidding:\n1. Showing your interest by bidding with or slightly above the starting price of this item, then gradually increase your bid.\n2. Think step by step of the pros and cons and the consequences of your action (e.g., remaining budget in future bidding) in order to achieve your primary objective.\n\n\nGive your reasons first, then make your final decision clearly. You should either withdraw (saying \"I'm out!\") or make a higher bid for this item (saying \"I bid $xxx!\")."},{"ai":"**Reasons for bidding:**\n\n* Contraption I is a priority 2 item for me, meaning that I am interested in winning it but it is not my top priority.\n* My estimated value for Contraption I is $6600, which means that I could make a profit of $3600 if I win it at the starting price of $3000.\n* I have a remaining budget of $4800, which means that I can afford to bid up to $6600 on Contraption I.\n* Bidder 2 and Bidder 3 have both spent a significant portion of their budgets, which gives me an advantage in bidding on the remaining items.\n\n**Reasons for withdrawing:**\n\n* I am not sure if I will be able to win Contraption I at a price that will allow me to make a profit.\n* I want to save my budget for the items that I have prioritized as 3.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI have decided to **bid $3100** on Contraption I. This is slightly above the starting price, but it is still within my budget and it shows that I am interested in winning this item. I am willing to go up to $6600 on this item, but I will only do so if I am confident that I can win it at a price that will allow me to make a profit.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nI believe that bidding $3100 on Contraption I is a good strategic move because it allows me to show my interest in this item without overspending. It also gives me the opportunity to see how the other bidders react to my bid.
