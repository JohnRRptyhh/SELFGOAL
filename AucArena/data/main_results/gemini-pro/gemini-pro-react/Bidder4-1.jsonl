Here's your previous status:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $1100\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 3: $700\n  * Bidder 4: $11100\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * Widget A: $1300\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Doodad D: $2600\n    * Utensil N: $4900\n    * Unit Q: $6000\n    * Contraption I: $4100\n    * Gadget B: $1300\n```\n\nSummarize the notable behaviors of all bidders in this round of bidding for future reference. Then, update the status JSON regarding the following information:\n- 'remaining_budget': The remaining budget of you, expressed as a numerical value.\n- 'total_profits': The total profits achieved so far for each bidder, where a numerical value following a bidder's name. No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}. If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"**Summary of Notable Behaviors:**\n\n* Bidder 3 won Apparatus H at $3500, which has a true value of $6000.
