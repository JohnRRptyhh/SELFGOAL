For example, if an item with an estimated value of $2000 sold for $2500, it may indicate that the true value is closer to $2500.","118":"Consider market knowledge: Utilize knowledge of the broader market to inform value estimates. Research similar items, consult with experts, or monitor industry trends to gain insights into the true value of items.","119":"Compare to own estimates: Evaluate how your own estimated values compare to the winning bids.

Monitor the number of bidders who have withdrawn or are no longer bidding on items.","122":"Target undervalued items: Focus on bidding on items where your estimated value exceeds the current bid price and where there are fewer strong competitors.","123":"If the potential profit margin is high and the likelihood of winning is low: Consider forming an alliance with another bidder to increase the chances of winning. Be prepared to negotiate with other bidders to secure the item at a favorable price.","124":"If the potential profit margin is negative: Withdraw from the bidding process to avoid losses.","125":"Overall profit strategy: Consider the impact of each bid on the overall profit goal.","126":"Identify active bidders: Note which bidders are consistently participating in the auction and placing bids.","127":"Observe bidding patterns: Analyze the bidding behavior of active bidders.

This can help you avoid bidding wars and secure the item at a lower price.","156":"Increment bids gradually: If other bidders raise their bids, increase your bid incrementally, but only up to your maximum bid. Avoid overbidding and potentially losing profit.","157":"Consider the value of the item to other bidders: Observe the bidding behavior of other participants to gauge their interest in the item. If multiple bidders are actively bidding, it may indicate that the item is highly valued, and you may need to adjust your maximum bid accordingly.","158":"Be prepared to walk away: If the bidding exceeds your maximum bid, do not hesitate to withdraw from the auction. It is better to secure a smaller profit or avoid a loss than to overspend and potentially lose money.","159":"Monitor the remaining budget: Keep track of your remaining budget and adjust your bidding strategy accordingly.
