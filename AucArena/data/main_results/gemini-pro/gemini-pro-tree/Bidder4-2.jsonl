However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Estimate item values accurately: Determine the true value of each item as closely as possible to make informed bidding decisions.\n - Identify undervalued items: Seek items where the estimated value exceeds the starting price, indicating potential profit opportunities.\n - Bid strategically: Place bids that are high enough to win the item but low enough to maximize profit.\n - Manage budget effectively: Allocate the budget wisely, considering the estimated values of items and the potential for profit.\n - Monitor competitors' bids: Observe the bidding behavior of other bidders to anticipate their strategies and adjust accordingly.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"As Bidder 4, you have a total budget of $20000.

If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"**Summary of Notable Behaviors:**\n\n* All bidders withdrew their bids on Unit Q, indicating a lack of interest in the item or a strategic move to conserve their budget.\n\n**Updated Status:**\n\n```\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 2600,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 5600,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 3500,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 0\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Thingamajig C\": 1200,\n      \"Gadget B\": 1100,\n      \"Gizmo F\": 2500,\n      \"Doodad D\": 2400,\n      \"Widget A\": 1200\n    },\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\n      \"Appliance O\": 4500\n    },\n    \"Bidder 3\": {}\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
