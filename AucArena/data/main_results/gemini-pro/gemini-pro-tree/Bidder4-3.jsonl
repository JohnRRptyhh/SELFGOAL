However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Set realistic price expectations: Based on the gathered data, establish a realistic range of prices for the items being auctioned. This will help you make informed bidding decisions.\n - Calculate the profit margin for each remaining item: Subtract the starting price from the estimated value to determine the potential profit for each item.\n - Determine the maximum bid: Calculate the highest bid you can place while still securing a profit. This involves considering your estimated value for the item and your remaining budget.\n - Consider the number of remaining bidders: If there are only a few bidders remaining, you may need to bid more aggressively to secure the item. However, if there are many bidders still active, you can afford to be more patient and wait for the price to rise before placing a higher bid.\n - Monitor competitors' bids: Observe the bidding behavior of other bidders to gauge their interest in specific items. If multiple bidders are actively bidding on an item, it may be prudent to adjust your maximum bid amount or consider withdrawing from the bidding.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Utensil N:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $4500\n- Bidder 2: $4500\n- Bidder 3: $4200\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Utensil N, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Utensil N. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.

However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Calculate potential profit margin: For each item, determine the difference between the estimated value and the starting price. This represents the potential profit margin if the item is won at the starting price.\n - Set a maximum bid price: For each item, determine the maximum bid price that would still result in a positive profit margin. This will help to prevent overspending and ensure that the budget is used effectively.\n - Monitor budget closely: Keep track of the remaining budget throughout the auction and adjust bidding strategies accordingly. If the budget is running low, consider withdrawing from bidding on items with lower profit margins.\n - Be willing to adjust your strategy: Monitor the bidding process and adjust your priorities as needed. If an item with a high profit margin becomes too competitive, consider shifting your focus to other items with more favorable odds.\n - Calculate the potential profit for each remaining item: Subtract the starting price from the estimated value to determine the potential profit for each item.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Apparatus H:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3200\n- Bidder 2: $3200\n- Bidder 3: $3500\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Estimate profit margin accurately: Use the estimated values as a guide, but be aware that the true value may differ.\n - Guidelines: {'1': 'Calculate the profit margin for each remaining item using the formula: Profit Margin = Estimated Value - Starting Price.', '2': 'Prioritize items with a positive profit margin, as these have the potential to generate profit.', '3': 'Consider the remaining budget when prioritizing items, as you may not be able to bid on all items with a positive profit margin.', '4': 'Be cautious when estimating profit margins, as the true value of an item may differ from your estimate.', '5': 'Use the profit margin calculations to inform your bidding decisions and maximize your overall profit.'}\n - Consider the starting price relative to other bidders' bids: If the starting price is significantly lower than the bids placed by other bidders in previous rounds, it may indicate an undervalued item.\n - Look for items that have not received many bids: Items that have not attracted much attention from other bidders may be undervalued.\n - Be cautious of items with starting prices that are too low: While a low starting price can be attractive, it may also indicate that the item is not as valuable as you estimate.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $10900\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $3500\n  * Bidder 2: $4000\n  * Bidder 3: $2500\n  * Bidder 4: $4900\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Appliance O: $4500\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Unit Q: $6000\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * Apparatus H: $3500\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Gadget B: $1300\n    * Widget A: $1300\n    * Machine P: $6500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Identify items with a high profit margin: Calculate the potential profit margin for each item by subtracting the estimated resale value from the current bid price. Focus on items with a high profit margin.\n - Estimate the true value of the item: Use the information available to you, such as the starting price and the estimated value, to make an informed estimate of the true value of the item.\n - Set a maximum bid that is below your estimated true value: This will help you avoid overbidding and ensure that you secure a profit if you win the item.\n - Consider the competition: Observe the bidding behavior of other bidders to assess the level of competition for each item.\n - Monitor the bids of other bidders: Observe the bidding behavior of other bidders to anticipate their strategies and adjust accordingly.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Implement G:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3200\n- Bidder 2: $3500\n- Bidder 3: $3500\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Implement G, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Implement G. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.
