Be prepared to adjust your bidding strategy based on the observed bidding behavior and your own financial situation.","92":"Manage budget effectively: Allocate funds wisely across remaining items to ensure sufficient resources for potential high-value items.","93":"Identify missed opportunities: If the difference is positive, it indicates that the winning bid was lower than the estimated value, suggesting a potential missed opportunity to secure a higher profit.","94":"Analyze the reasons for overbids and missed opportunities: Consider factors such as competition, bidding strategies, and market conditions to understand why overbids or missed opportunities occurred.","95":"Prioritize items with large differences: Focus on analyzing items where the difference between winning bid and estimated value is significant, as these represent the greatest potential for improvement.","96":"Calculate the average profit margin: Determine the average profit margin achieved on previous winning bids to establish a benchmark for acceptable profitability.","97":"Consider the remaining budget: Assess the remaining budget and determine how much profit is needed to reach the desired overall profit target.","98":"Adjust the threshold dynamically: Monitor the auction progress and adjust the minimum profit threshold as needed. For example, if you are consistently winning items at a higher profit margin than expected, you may increase the threshold to secure even greater profits.","99":"Consider the overall profit margin: While securing individual items with high profit margins is important, also consider the cumulative profit margin across all items won. Aim to maximize the overall profit margin by balancing individual item profits with the potential for future profitable items.","100":"Stay within budget: Ensure that bidding decisions align with the remaining budget to avoid overspending and maintain financial flexibility.","101":"Identify the current highest bid for each item: Review the auction log to determine the highest bid placed on each remaining item.","102":"Determine the sign of the discrepancy: If the result is positive, it indicates that your estimated value is higher than the current highest bid. If the result is negative, it indicates that your estimated value is lower than the current highest bid.","103":"Consider the item's true value: If the discrepancy is large and the item's true value is likely to be higher than your estimated value, it may be a particularly attractive target.","104":"Evaluate the bidding history: Examine the bidding history of items with large discrepancies to assess the likelihood of winning at a favorable price.","105":"Identify items with unusually low starting prices: Compare the starting price to the estimated value of the item. If the starting price is significantly lower than the estimated value, it may indicate that the item is undervalued and could attract more bidders.","106":"Consider the popularity of the item: Research the item to determine if it is in high demand or has a large following. Popular items are more likely to attract multiple bidders, increasing the competition and driving up the winning bid.","107":"Estimate the number of potential bidders: Observe the bidding behavior of other bidders in previous rounds. If there are many bidders actively participating in the auction, it is more likely that the winning bid for low-priced items will be higher.","108":"Track the number of bids placed on each item: Items with fewer bids generally indicate lower competition.","109":"Consider the starting price of the item: Items with higher starting prices may deter bidders, resulting in lower competition.","110":"Bid early on items with low competition: This increases the chances of winning the item before other bidders join the competition.","111":"Prioritize items within budget: Focus on items that have a starting price and estimated value within your remaining budget. This will increase the likelihood of securing items at a profit.","112":"Consider opportunity cost: Evaluate the potential profit of an item against the opportunity cost of using your budget on other items.

It is better to underestimate slightly and secure a higher profit margin.","125":"Update estimates as new information becomes available: As the auction progresses and more information is revealed, adjust your estimated values accordingly to reflect the changing market dynamics.","126":"Consider the current bidding activity: Observe the bidding behavior of other bidders to identify items that are being undervalued or overlooked.","127":"Analyze previous bidding behavior: Observe the bidding patterns of other bidders to infer their estimated values for items. For example, if multiple bidders are actively bidding on an item, it may indicate that its true value is higher than the starting price.","128":"Compare to similar items: If you have information about the true value of similar items that have been sold recently, use this as a reference point to estimate the value of the current item.","129":"Factor in item condition and rarity: The condition and rarity of an item can significantly affect its true value. Consider these factors when refining your estimates.","130":"Use a range of values: Instead of a single estimated value, consider using a range of values to account for uncertainty. This can help you make more informed bidding decisions.","131":"Identify items with positive value differences: These items have estimated values that exceed their starting prices, indicating potential profit opportunities.","132":"Consider the remaining budget: Ensure that there is sufficient budget available to bid on items with high value differences.","133":"Set a threshold for undervaluation: Determine a specific percentage or amount by which an item's estimated value must exceed its starting price to be considered undervalued.","134":"Monitor the auction closely: Pay attention to the bidding activity and adjust your estimates and strategies as needed to identify undervalued items throughout the auction.","135":"Consider your remaining budget: Ensure that you have sufficient budget to cover the starting price of the items you are targeting.","136":"Target items where you have a competitive advantage: Focus on items where your estimated value is significantly higher than the starting price, indicating a potential opportunity for a substantial profit.","137":"Consider your remaining budget: Ensure that your maximum bid for each item does not exceed your remaining budget.","138":"Specific guidelines: {'For items with a potential profit of less than 10% of your remaining budget': 'Consider bidding up to 90% of your maximum bid.', 'For items with a potential profit between 10% and 25% of your remaining budget': 'Consider bidding up to 75% of your maximum bid.', 'For items with a potential profit greater than 25% of your remaining budget': 'Consider bidding up to 50% of your maximum bid.'}","139":"Be prepared to increase your bid: If other bidders place higher bids, be prepared to increase your bid incrementally until you reach your maximum bid or the item exceeds your estimated value.","140":"Increment bids gradually: Increase your bids in small increments, only as necessary to stay ahead of other bidders.","141":"Be prepared to walk away: If the bidding becomes too competitive and your maximum bid is exceeded, be willing to withdraw from the auction to avoid losses.","142":"Consider the value of the item to other bidders: Estimate how much other bidders may value the item based on its estimated value and their remaining budgets. This can help you determine the likelihood of winning at a given bid price.","143":"Set a maximum bid amount for each item: Determine a threshold beyond which you are unwilling to bid, based on your estimated value and remaining budget.","144":"Allocate funds strategically: Divide your budget into smaller amounts for different categories of items, such as high-value items, mid-range items, and low-value items.","145":"Monitor your spending: Keep track of your bids and winnings to ensure you are staying within your budget.","146":"Adjust your bidding strategy: If you are consistently exceeding your maximum bid amounts or running low on funds, adjust your strategy by bidding less aggressively or targeting lower-value items.","147":"Consider the potential value of future items: Take into account the remaining items in the auction and their estimated values when allocating your budget.","148":"Monitor competition: Observe the bidding behavior of other bidders to anticipate their strategies and adjust accordingly.","149":"Negotiate with other bidders: Explore opportunities to form alliances or negotiate deals with other bidders to secure items at favorable prices.","150":"Calculate potential profit for each item: Subtract the starting price from the estimated value for each remaining item.","151":"Estimate true value accurately: Recall that estimated values may deviate from true values. Consider the possibility of overestimation or underestimation when evaluating profit margins.","152":"Adjust strategy based on auction dynamics: If multiple bidders are targeting the same high-margin items, consider adjusting the bidding strategy to avoid overspending or missing out on other opportunities.","153":"Calculate remaining budget after each win: Deduct the winning bid amount from the remaining budget to ensure accurate tracking of available funds.","154":"Be prepared to bid aggressively on high-value items: If necessary, be willing to bid above the starting price to secure items with high estimated values and profit margins.","155":"Avoid getting caught up in bidding wars on low-value items: Focus on items with the highest potential profit to maximize overall returns.","156":"Avoid overbidding: Exercise caution to prevent bidding beyond the estimated value of an item, which could result in losses.","157":"Stay within budget: Adhere to the allocated budget to avoid financial overextension and ensure profitability."}},"arms_cnt":{"Bidder 1":[],"Bidder 2":[],"Bidder 3":[],"Bidder 4":[1,9,29,39,54,69,80,90,94,107,111,122,129,132,148,158]},"model_info":{"Bidder 1":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 2":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 3":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106","Bidder 4":"gemini-pro"}}
