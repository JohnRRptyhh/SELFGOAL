Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1.

However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Estimate item values accurately: Determine the true value of each item as closely as possible to make informed bidding decisions.\n - Identify undervalued items: Seek items where the estimated value exceeds the starting price, indicating potential profit opportunities.\n - Bid strategically: Place bids that are high enough to win the item but low enough to maximize profit.\n - Manage budget effectively: Allocate the available budget wisely, prioritizing items with higher profit potential.\n - Monitor competitors' bids: Observe the bidding behavior of other bidders to anticipate their strategies and adjust accordingly.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Gadget B:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $1100\n- Bidder 2: $1100\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $1200\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Compare to remaining budget: Ensure that the potential profit is significant enough to justify spending a portion of the remaining budget.\n - Identify competitive items: Items with a high number of bids are likely to be competitive and may require higher bids to win. Consider your estimated value for the item and your budget before bidding on these items.\n - Items with low starting prices: Items with starting prices significantly below their estimated value (e.g., Gadget B, Widget A) have the potential for higher profit margins. Bidders may be more likely to overlook these items, leading to lower competition and potentially lower winning bids.\n - Factor in your remaining budget: Ensure that you have sufficient budget to cover the potential winning bid and still maintain a profit margin.\n - Evaluate the potential profit margin: Calculate the difference between your estimated value and the starting price. A higher profit margin indicates more potential profit, which may justify bidding more aggressively.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Implement G:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3200\n- Bidder 2: $3200\n- Bidder 3: $3500\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
