However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Estimate item values accurately: Determine the true value of each item as closely as possible to make informed bidding decisions.\n - Identify undervalued items: Seek out items where the estimated value exceeds the starting price, indicating potential profit opportunities.\n - Bid strategically: Place bids that are high enough to win the item but low enough to maximize profit.\n - Manage budget effectively: Allocate funds wisely across items to avoid overspending and ensure sufficient resources for potential high-value items.\n - Prioritize high-value items: Focus on securing items with the highest estimated values to maximize overall profit.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"As Bidder 4, you have a total budget of $20000.

I would need to bid at least $1500 to secure the item, which would leave me with only $600 for future bidding. This would significantly reduce my chances of winning other items and achieving my primary objective of securing the highest overall profit.\n\nBy withdrawing from the bidding for Gadget B, I can preserve my budget and focus on other items that may offer a better chance of profit.","tag":"bid_14"},{"messages":[{"system":"You are Bidder 4, who is attending an ascending-bid auction as a bidder. This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Estimate item value accurately: Determine the true value of the remaining item (Gadget B) as closely as possible to make an informed bidding decision.\n - Calculate maximum bid: Determine the highest bid you can place while still maintaining a profit margin. This involves subtracting your estimated profit margin from your estimated value of the item.\n - Start with a low bid: Place an initial bid that is below your maximum bid to avoid overpaying.\n - Prioritize items: If you have multiple items you are interested in, prioritize the items with the highest estimated profit margins.\n - Compare to profit threshold: Establish a minimum profit threshold that you are willing to accept before bidding. This threshold should consider your overall profit goals and budget constraints.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Gadget B:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $1200\n- Bidder 2: $1200\n- Bidder 3: $1200\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Gadget B, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Gadget B. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.

Then, update the status JSON regarding the following information:\n- 'remaining_budget': The remaining budget of you, expressed as a numerical value.\n- 'total_profits': The total profits achieved so far for each bidder, where a numerical value following a bidder's name. No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}.
