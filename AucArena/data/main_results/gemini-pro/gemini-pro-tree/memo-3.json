It can be a strategic move to conserve budget and focus on more profitable items.","117":"Set a budget limit: Determine a maximum budget limit before the auction starts and stick to it to avoid overspending.","118":"Identify aggressive bidders: Note which bidders are consistently placing high bids, even on items with low estimated values. These bidders may be willing to overpay for items, so it's important to be cautious when bidding against them.","119":"Analyze winning bids: Examine the winning bids for items that have already been sold to get a sense of the market value for similar items.","120":"Adjust estimated values: Based on the above factors, refine your estimated values for the remaining items to improve your bidding strategy.","121":"Factor in shipping costs: If you need to factor in shipping costs, adjust your estimated value accordingly.","122":"Stay flexible: Be prepared to adjust your estimated values as you learn more about the market and the items being auctioned.","123":"Consider the likelihood of winning: Estimate the probability of winning each item based on the current bidding behavior of other bidders.","124":"Identify competitive items: Monitor the bidding activity and identify items that are attracting high bids from multiple competitors.","125":"Adjust bids: If an item becomes too competitive, consider withdrawing your bid or bidding less aggressively.","126":"Explore alternative items: If an item with a high profit margin becomes unattainable, shift your focus to other items with more favorable odds.","127":"Be flexible: Don't stick rigidly to a predetermined bidding strategy.

Avoid chasing items that are likely to attract intense competition or have highly inflated estimated values.","133":"Compare to previous items: Analyze the results of previous rounds to identify items that have consistently sold for prices below their estimated value.","134":"Consider overall profit goals: Determine the total profit you aim to achieve in the auction. This will influence the minimum profit margin you are willing to accept on each item.","135":"Assess risk tolerance: Evaluate your willingness to take risks and potentially lose money on some items in order to secure higher profits on others.","136":"Compare to similar items: Look for comparable items being sold on other platforms or in retail stores to get a sense of their market value.","137":"Use online valuation tools: Utilize online resources and tools that provide estimated values for specific items based on their features and condition.","138":"Consult with experts: Seek advice from industry experts, appraisers, or collectors who have specialized knowledge about the types of items being auctioned.","139":"Continuously refine your estimates: As you gain more experience and knowledge, adjust your estimation methods to improve their accuracy.","140":"Prioritize items: Identify the items that are most important to you and set higher minimum profit margins for those items.","141":"Consider opportunity cost: Factor in the potential profit you could earn by investing your budget in other items or auctions.","142":"Adjust margins dynamically: As the auction progresses and you gain more information, be prepared to adjust your minimum profit margins accordingly.","143":"Start with a low bid: Begin with a bid that is below your maximum bid, but high enough to demonstrate your interest in the item. This can help you avoid bidding wars and secure the item at a lower price.","144":"Increment bids gradually: If other bidders outbid you, increase your bid incrementally, but only up to your maximum bid. Avoid making large jumps in your bids, as this could signal desperation and lead to overspending.","145":"If there are only a few bidders remaining: {'Increase bid aggressiveness': 'Place higher bids earlier in the auction to deter other bidders and increase the likelihood of winning the item.', 'Consider overbidding': 'If the estimated value of the item is significantly higher than the current bid, consider placing a bid that exceeds your estimated value to secure the item.', 'Negotiate with other bidders': 'Explore opportunities to form alliances or negotiate deals with other bidders to secure items at favorable prices.'}","146":"Calculate the potential profit margin: Determine the difference between the estimated value of the item and the starting price.","147":"Be prepared to withdraw bids: If the bidding becomes too competitive and the profit margin is no longer sufficient, be willing to withdraw bids to preserve budget.","148":"Estimate profit margin accurately: Use realistic estimated values based on market research or previous experience to ensure accurate profit margin calculations.","149":"Be prepared to bid aggressively on high-value items: If an item has a high estimated profit margin and you believe it is undervalued, be willing to bid more aggressively to secure the item.","150":"Adjust bids based on remaining budget: As the auction progresses and your budget decreases, adjust your maximum bids accordingly to ensure you have sufficient funds to secure the most profitable items.","151":"Consider potential alliances: Explore opportunities to form alliances with other bidders to secure items at favorable prices. For example, you could team up with Bidder 3, who has a similar profit goal and has already won Apparatus H.","152":"Assess the number of bidders: Note how many bidders are actively participating in the auction. A large number of bidders may indicate increased competition and potentially higher winning bids.","153":"Consider the timing of bids: Observe when other bidders place their bids. Bidders who place bids early may be trying to establish a high starting point or deter other bidders from participating. Bidders who wait until the last moment to bid may be trying to snipe the item at a lower price.","154":"Analyze bid withdrawals: If other bidders withdraw their bids, it could indicate that they have a low estimated value for the item or that they are facing budget constraints.","155":"Be prepared to walk away: If the bidding price exceeds your maximum bid, do not hesitate to withdraw from the auction. It is better to lose an item than to overspend and reduce your overall profit.","156":"Adjust strategy: Based on the potential profit and budget constraints, adjust the bidding strategy accordingly.","157":"Consider the risk of losing: Factor in the possibility of losing the bid to other bidders, which could result in a loss of budget.","158":"Consider the value of future items: Keep in mind the remaining items in the auction and their potential value.
