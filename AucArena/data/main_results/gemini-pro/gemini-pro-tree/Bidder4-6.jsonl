Consider the current bidding activity and the estimated values of other bidders to refine the profit margin estimate.\n - Consider the risk of overbidding: Be cautious of overbidding on items, as this can quickly deplete the remaining budget and reduce the chances of winning future items.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Mechanism J:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $4500\n- Bidder 2: $4500\n- Bidder 3: $4200\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Mechanism J, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Mechanism J. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Identify items with high potential profit margins: Focus on items where the potential profit margin is significant, indicating a good return on investment.\n - Prioritize items based on profit potential: Calculate the potential profit for each target item by subtracting the starting price from the estimated value. Prioritize items with higher potential profit.\n - Use the difference as a guide, not a rule: The difference between estimated value and starting price is just one factor to consider when making bidding decisions. Other factors, such as the estimated values of other bidders and the remaining budget, should also be taken into account.\n - Consider your overall profit target: Determine the total profit you aim to achieve at the end of the auction. This will influence the profit margin goals you set for individual items.\n - Consider the likelihood of winning: Assess the bidding behavior of other bidders and your own budget to estimate the probability of winning each item. Prioritize items that you have a high chance of winning at a favorable price.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Appliance O:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $4500\n- Bidder 2: $5000\n- Bidder 3: $5000\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $5400\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n\nRound 2:\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
