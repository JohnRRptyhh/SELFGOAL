Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction.

Apparatus H to Bidder 1 at $3500! The true value for Apparatus H is $6000.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Apparatus H. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding. Here's your previous status:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $1000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $2800\n  * Bidder 2: $5500\n  * Bidder 3: $6100\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Contraption I: $3200\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Implement G: $3500\n    * Gizmo F: $2500\n    * Doodad D: $2500\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * Equipment E: $2500\n    * Utensil N: $4200\n    * Thingamajig C: $1200\n```\n\nSummarize the notable behaviors of all bidders in this round of bidding for future reference. Then, update the status JSON regarding the following information:\n- 'remaining_budget': The remaining budget of you, expressed as a numerical value.\n- 'total_profits': The total profits achieved so far for each bidder, where a numerical value following a bidder's name. No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}. If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"**Summary of Notable Behaviors:**\n\n* Bidder 1 won Apparatus H at $3500, which has a true value of $6000. This suggests that Bidder 1 may have overpaid for this item.\n* Bidder 2 withdrew from the bidding for Apparatus H. This could indicate that Bidder 2 recognized that they were unlikely to win the item at a price that would be profitable for them.\n* Bidder 3 and Bidder 4 both withdrew from the bidding for Apparatus H in the first round. This suggests that they may have had a low estimated value for this item or that they were unwilling to risk overpaying.\n\n**Updated Status:**\n\n```\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 1000,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 2800,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 5500,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 6100\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Contraption I\": 3200\n    },\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\n      \"Implement G\": 3500,\n      \"Gizmo F\": 2500,\n      \"Doodad D\": 2500\n    },\n    \"Bidder 3\": {\n      \"Equipment E\": 2500,\n      \"Utensil N\": 4200,\n      \"Thingamajig C\": 1200\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_11"},{"messages":[{"human":"Review and reflect on the historical data provided from a past auction. \n\n## Auction Log\n\n### 1.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction. You can use them to guide this auction:\n```\nLearnings:\n-1. Withdrawing bids MAY BE NECESSARY to avoid overpaying.\n2. Starting bids SHOULD BE NECESSARY to attract initial interest.\n3.
