This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction. You can use them to guide this auction:\n```\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction failed to attract a high enough bid due to the starting price being too high. Bidders were unwilling to pay more than $3800 for the contraption, which was below the starting price of $3000.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this failure, the starting price should be lowered to a more attractive level. This will encourage more bidders to participate and increase the likelihood of a successful auction.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that several bidders withdrew their bids during the auction. This could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules to all bidders before the auction begins.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction. You can use them to guide this auction:\n```\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction failed to attract a high enough bid due to the starting price being too high. Bidders were unwilling to pay more than $3800 for the contraption, which was below the starting price of $3000.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this failure, the starting price should be lowered to a more attractive level. This will encourage more bidders to participate and increase the likelihood of a successful auction.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that several bidders withdrew their bids during the auction. This could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules to all bidders before the auction begins.

Bidders were unwilling to pay more than $3800 for the contraption, which was below the starting price of $3000.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this failure, the starting price should be lowered to a more attractive level. This will encourage more bidders to participate and increase the likelihood of a successful auction.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that several bidders withdrew their bids during the auction. This could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules to all bidders before the auction begins. The auctioneer should also build trust with the bidders by providing accurate information about the items being auctioned and by conducting the auction in a fair and transparent manner.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that several bidders withdrew their bids, which could be due to a lack of confidence in the auction process or a misunderstanding of the bidding rules.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise instructions to bidders before the auction begins.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid.

Bidders were unwilling to pay more than $3800 for the contraption, which was below the starting price of $3000.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this failure, the starting price should be lowered to a more attractive level. This will encourage more bidders to participate and increase the likelihood of a successful auction.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that several bidders withdrew their bids during the auction. This could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules to all bidders before the auction begins.
