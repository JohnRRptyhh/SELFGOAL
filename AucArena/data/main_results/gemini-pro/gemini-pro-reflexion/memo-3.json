This tie resulted in two of the bidders withdrawing, leaving only one bidder to continue.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auction should implement a tie-breaking mechanism. This mechanism could involve setting a time limit for each bid, after which the highest bidder would be declared the winner. Alternatively, the auction could use a random number generator to select the winning bidder in the event of a tie.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that several bidders withdrew their bids during the auction. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as a lack of interest in the item, a change in strategy, or a belief that the item was not worth the current bid price.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate the issue of bidders withdrawing their bids, the auctioneer could implement a reserve price, which is a minimum price that the item must sell for in order for the auction to be successful. This would help to ensure that bidders are serious about purchasing the item and are less likely to withdraw their bids. Additionally, the auctioneer could provide more information about the item prior to the auction, such as its condition and history, to help bidders make more informed decisions about whether or not to bid.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that several bidders withdrew their bids during the auction. This could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a misunderstanding of the bidding process.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise instructions to the bidders before the auction begins. The instructions should include information on the bidding process, the starting price, and the minimum bid increment. The auctioneer should also be available to answer any questions that bidders may have.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that several bidders withdrew their bids during the auction.
