The starting price may have been too high, or the appliance may not have been desirable to the target audience.\n\n**New Plan:**\n\n* Research the target audience and their interests to determine an appropriate starting price.\n* Highlight the unique features and benefits of the appliance in the auction description to increase its desirability.\n* Consider offering incentives or discounts to encourage bidding.\n* Promote the auction through multiple channels to reach a wider audience.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction failed to reach the true value of Appliance O due to a lack of competitive bidding. Bidders 1, 2, and 3 withdrew their bids in the first round, leaving only Bidder 4 to bid against the starting price. This lack of competition allowed Bidder 4 to acquire the appliance for a price significantly below its true value.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this failure, the auction should be redesigned to encourage more competitive bidding. This could be achieved by:\n\n* Setting a lower starting price to attract more bidders.\n* Using a reserve price to ensure that the appliance does not sell for less than its true value.\n* Extending the bidding period to give bidders more time to consider their bids.\n* Promoting the auction more widely to attract a larger pool of potential bidders.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that many bidders withdrew their bids, which could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules and should build trust with potential bidders by providing accurate information about the items being auctioned and by conducting the auction in a fair and transparent manner.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that many bidders withdrew their bids, which could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules and should build trust with the bidders by being transparent and responsive. Additionally, the auctioneer should consider offering incentives to encourage bidders to participate and stay engaged throughout the auction.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that many bidders withdrew their bids, which could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a misunderstanding of the bidding process.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise instructions to bidders before the auction begins. This should include information on the bidding process, the starting price, and any reserve prices.

The auctioneer should also provide a platform for bidders to ask questions and receive clarification on the auction process. Additionally, the auctioneer should consider implementing a reserve price to ensure that the items are sold at a fair market value.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that several items failed to sell, and in some cases, there were no bids at all. This suggests that the starting prices may have been set too high, discouraging bidders from participating.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, I recommend lowering the starting prices for future auctions. This will make the items more attractive to bidders and increase the likelihood of successful sales. Additionally, I suggest providing more information about the items being auctioned, such as their condition and any relevant specifications. This will help bidders make more informed decisions and encourage them to participate in the auction.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that several items failed to sell, and in some cases, there were no bids at all.

This could be achieved by:\n\n* Setting a lower starting price to attract more bidders.\n* Using a reserve price to ensure that the appliance does not sell for less than its true value.\n* Extending the bidding period to give bidders more time to consider their bids.\n* Promoting the auction more widely to attract a larger pool of potential bidders.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that many bidders withdrew their bids, which could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules and should build trust with potential bidders by providing accurate information about the items being auctioned and by conducting the auction in a fair and transparent manner.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that many bidders withdrew their bids, which could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules and should build trust with the bidders by being transparent and responsive.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value.

You can use them to guide this auction:\n```\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction failed due to a lack of interest from bidders. The starting price may have been too high, or the appliance may not have been desirable to the target audience.\n\n**New Plan:**\n\n* Research the target audience and their interests to determine an appropriate starting price.\n* Highlight the unique features and benefits of the appliance in the auction description to increase its desirability.\n* Consider offering incentives or discounts to encourage bidding.\n* Promote the auction through multiple channels to reach a wider audience.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction failed to reach the true value of Appliance O due to a lack of competitive bidding. Bidders 1, 2, and 3 withdrew their bids in the first round, leaving only Bidder 4 to bid against the starting price. This lack of competition allowed Bidder 4 to acquire the appliance for a price significantly below its true value.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this failure, the auction should be redesigned to encourage more competitive bidding. This could be achieved by:\n\n* Setting a lower starting price to attract more bidders.\n* Using a reserve price to ensure that the appliance does not sell for less than its true value.\n* Extending the bidding period to give bidders more time to consider their bids.\n* Promoting the auction more widely to attract a larger pool of potential bidders.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that many bidders withdrew their bids, which could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules and should build trust with potential bidders by providing accurate information about the items being auctioned and by conducting the auction in a fair and transparent manner.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that many bidders withdrew their bids, which could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules and should build trust with the bidders by being transparent and responsive.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction. You can use them to guide this auction:\n```\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction failed due to a lack of interest from bidders. The starting price may have been too high, or the appliance may not have been desirable to the target audience.\n\n**New Plan:**\n\n* Research the target audience and their interests to determine an appropriate starting price.\n* Highlight the unique features and benefits of the appliance in the auction description to increase its desirability.\n* Consider offering incentives or discounts to encourage bidding.\n* Promote the auction through multiple channels to reach a wider audience.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction failed to reach the true value of Appliance O due to a lack of competitive bidding. Bidders 1, 2, and 3 withdrew their bids in the first round, leaving only Bidder 4 to bid against the starting price. This lack of competition allowed Bidder 4 to acquire the appliance for a price significantly below its true value.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this failure, the auction should be redesigned to encourage more competitive bidding. This could be achieved by:\n\n* Setting a lower starting price to attract more bidders.\n* Using a reserve price to ensure that the appliance does not sell for less than its true value.\n* Extending the bidding period to give bidders more time to consider their bids.\n* Promoting the auction more widely to attract a larger pool of potential bidders.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that many bidders withdrew their bids, which could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules and should build trust with potential bidders by providing accurate information about the items being auctioned and by conducting the auction in a fair and transparent manner.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that many bidders withdrew their bids, which could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules and should build trust with the bidders by being transparent and responsive.

This suggests that the starting prices may have been set too high, discouraging bidders from participating.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, I recommend lowering the starting prices for future auctions. This will make the items more attractive to bidders and increase the likelihood of successful sales.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction. You can use them to guide this auction:\n```\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction failed due to a lack of interest from bidders. The starting price may have been too high, or the appliance may not have been desirable to the target audience.\n\n**New Plan:**\n\n* Research the target audience and their interests to determine an appropriate starting price.\n* Highlight the unique features and benefits of the appliance in the auction description to increase its desirability.\n* Consider offering incentives or discounts to encourage bidding.\n* Promote the auction through multiple channels to reach a wider audience.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction failed to reach the true value of Appliance O due to a lack of competitive bidding. Bidders 1, 2, and 3 withdrew their bids in the first round, leaving only Bidder 4 to bid against the starting price. This lack of competition allowed Bidder 4 to acquire the appliance for a price significantly below its true value.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this failure, the auction should be redesigned to encourage more competitive bidding. This could be achieved by:\n\n* Setting a lower starting price to attract more bidders.\n* Using a reserve price to ensure that the appliance does not sell for less than its true value.\n* Extending the bidding period to give bidders more time to consider their bids.\n* Promoting the auction more widely to attract a larger pool of potential bidders.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that many bidders withdrew their bids, which could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules and should build trust with potential bidders by providing accurate information about the items being auctioned and by conducting the auction in a fair and transparent manner.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that many bidders withdrew their bids, which could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules and should build trust with the bidders by being transparent and responsive.

This suggests that the starting prices may have been set too high, discouraging bidders from participating.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, I recommend lowering the starting prices for future auctions. This will make the items more attractive to bidders and increase the likelihood of successful sales. Additionally, I suggest providing more information about the items being auctioned, such as their condition and any relevant specifications. This will help bidders make more informed decisions and encourage them to participate in the auction.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that several items failed to sell, and in some cases, there were no bids at all.

The starting price may have been too high, or the appliance may not have been desirable to the target audience.\n\n**New Plan:**\n\n* Research the target audience and their interests to determine an appropriate starting price.\n* Highlight the unique features and benefits of the appliance in the auction description to increase its desirability.\n* Consider offering incentives or discounts to encourage bidding.\n* Promote the auction through multiple channels to reach a wider audience.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction failed to reach the true value of Appliance O due to a lack of competitive bidding. Bidders 1, 2, and 3 withdrew their bids in the first round, leaving only Bidder 4 to bid against the starting price. This lack of competition allowed Bidder 4 to acquire the appliance for a price significantly below its true value.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this failure, the auction should be redesigned to encourage more competitive bidding. This could be achieved by:\n\n* Setting a lower starting price to attract more bidders.\n* Using a reserve price to ensure that the appliance does not sell for less than its true value.\n* Extending the bidding period to give bidders more time to consider their bids.\n* Promoting the auction more widely to attract a larger pool of potential bidders.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that many bidders withdrew their bids, which could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules and should build trust with potential bidders by providing accurate information about the items being auctioned and by conducting the auction in a fair and transparent manner.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that many bidders withdrew their bids, which could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules and should build trust with the bidders by being transparent and responsive.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction. You can use them to guide this auction:\n```\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction failed due to a lack of interest from bidders. The starting price may have been too high, or the appliance may not have been desirable to the target audience.\n\n**New Plan:**\n\n* Research the target audience and their interests to determine an appropriate starting price.\n* Highlight the unique features and benefits of the appliance in the auction description to increase its desirability.\n* Consider offering incentives or discounts to encourage bidding.\n* Promote the auction through multiple channels to reach a wider audience.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction failed to reach the true value of Appliance O due to a lack of competitive bidding. Bidders 1, 2, and 3 withdrew their bids in the first round, leaving only Bidder 4 to bid against the starting price. This lack of competition allowed Bidder 4 to acquire the appliance for a price significantly below its true value.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this failure, the auction should be redesigned to encourage more competitive bidding. This could be achieved by:\n\n* Setting a lower starting price to attract more bidders.\n* Using a reserve price to ensure that the appliance does not sell for less than its true value.\n* Extending the bidding period to give bidders more time to consider their bids.\n* Promoting the auction more widely to attract a larger pool of potential bidders.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that many bidders withdrew their bids, which could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules and should build trust with potential bidders by providing accurate information about the items being auctioned and by conducting the auction in a fair and transparent manner.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that many bidders withdrew their bids, which could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules and should build trust with the bidders by being transparent and responsive.

This suggests that the starting prices may have been set too high, discouraging bidders from participating.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, I recommend lowering the starting prices for future auctions. This will make the items more attractive to bidders and increase the likelihood of successful sales. Additionally, I suggest providing more information about the items being auctioned, such as their condition and any relevant specifications. This will help bidders make more informed decisions and encourage them to participate in the auction.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that several items failed to sell, and in some cases, there were no bids at all. This suggests that the starting prices may have been set too high, discouraging bidders from participating.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, I propose the following high-level plan:\n\n* **Research and determine appropriate starting prices:** Conduct thorough market research to establish realistic starting prices that are in line with the true value of the items being auctioned.\n* **Provide clear and accurate item descriptions:** Ensure that the auction listings include detailed descriptions of the items, including their condition, features, and any relevant specifications.\n* **Promote the auction effectively:** Utilize multiple channels to promote the auction and reach potential bidders, such as online advertising, social media, and email marketing.\n* **Consider offering incentives for early bidding:** Encourage bidders to participate early by offering incentives such as discounts or free shipping for those who place bids within a certain timeframe.\n* **Monitor the auction closely and adjust as needed:** Track the progress of the auction and make adjustments to the starting prices or bidding increments if necessary to ensure a successful outcome.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that several items failed to sell, and in some cases, there were no bids at all.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction. You can use them to guide this auction:\n```\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction failed due to a lack of interest from bidders. The starting price may have been too high, or the appliance may not have been desirable to the target audience.\n\n**New Plan:**\n\n* Research the target audience and their interests to determine an appropriate starting price.\n* Highlight the unique features and benefits of the appliance in the auction description to increase its desirability.\n* Consider offering incentives or discounts to encourage bidding.\n* Promote the auction through multiple channels to reach a wider audience.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction failed to reach the true value of Appliance O due to a lack of competitive bidding. Bidders 1, 2, and 3 withdrew their bids in the first round, leaving only Bidder 4 to bid against the starting price. This lack of competition allowed Bidder 4 to acquire the appliance for a price significantly below its true value.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this failure, the auction should be redesigned to encourage more competitive bidding. This could be achieved by:\n\n* Setting a lower starting price to attract more bidders.\n* Using a reserve price to ensure that the appliance does not sell for less than its true value.\n* Extending the bidding period to give bidders more time to consider their bids.\n* Promoting the auction more widely to attract a larger pool of potential bidders.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that many bidders withdrew their bids, which could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules and should build trust with potential bidders by providing accurate information about the items being auctioned and by conducting the auction in a fair and transparent manner.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that many bidders withdrew their bids, which could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules and should build trust with the bidders by being transparent and responsive.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value.

The starting price may have been too high, or the appliance may not have been desirable to the target audience.\n\n**New Plan:**\n\n* Research the target audience and their interests to determine an appropriate starting price.\n* Highlight the unique features and benefits of the appliance in the auction description to increase its desirability.\n* Consider offering incentives or discounts to encourage bidding.\n* Promote the auction through multiple channels to reach a wider audience.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction failed to reach the true value of Appliance O due to a lack of competitive bidding. Bidders 1, 2, and 3 withdrew their bids in the first round, leaving only Bidder 4 to bid against the starting price. This lack of competition allowed Bidder 4 to acquire the appliance for a price significantly below its true value.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this failure, the auction should be redesigned to encourage more competitive bidding. This could be achieved by:\n\n* Setting a lower starting price to attract more bidders.\n* Using a reserve price to ensure that the appliance does not sell for less than its true value.\n* Extending the bidding period to give bidders more time to consider their bids.\n* Promoting the auction more widely to attract a larger pool of potential bidders.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that many bidders withdrew their bids, which could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules and should build trust with potential bidders by providing accurate information about the items being auctioned and by conducting the auction in a fair and transparent manner.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that many bidders withdrew their bids, which could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules and should build trust with the bidders by being transparent and responsive.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from a previous auction. You can use them to guide this auction:\n```\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction failed due to a lack of interest from bidders. The starting price may have been too high, or the appliance may not have been desirable to the target audience.\n\n**New Plan:**\n\n* Research the target audience and their interests to determine an appropriate starting price.\n* Highlight the unique features and benefits of the appliance in the auction description to increase its desirability.\n* Consider offering incentives or discounts to encourage bidding.\n* Promote the auction through multiple channels to reach a wider audience.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction failed to reach the true value of Appliance O due to a lack of competitive bidding. Bidders 1, 2, and 3 withdrew their bids in the first round, leaving only Bidder 4 to bid against the starting price. This lack of competition allowed Bidder 4 to acquire the appliance for a price significantly below its true value.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this failure, the auction should be redesigned to encourage more competitive bidding. This could be achieved by:\n\n* Setting a lower starting price to attract more bidders.\n* Using a reserve price to ensure that the appliance does not sell for less than its true value.\n* Extending the bidding period to give bidders more time to consider their bids.\n* Promoting the auction more widely to attract a larger pool of potential bidders.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that many bidders withdrew their bids, which could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules and should build trust with potential bidders by providing accurate information about the items being auctioned and by conducting the auction in a fair and transparent manner.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that many bidders withdrew their bids, which could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a lack of confidence in the auctioneer.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise auction rules and should build trust with the bidders by being transparent and responsive. Additionally, the auctioneer should consider offering incentives to encourage bidders to participate and stay engaged throughout the auction.\nReflections:\n-**Diagnosis:** The auction log indicates that many bidders withdrew their bids, which could be due to a lack of clarity in the auction rules or a misunderstanding of the bidding process.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, the auctioneer should provide clear and concise instructions to bidders before the auction begins. This should include information on the bidding process, the starting price, and any reserve prices.

This suggests that the starting prices may have been set too high, discouraging bidders from participating.\n\n**New Plan:** To mitigate this issue, I recommend lowering the starting prices for future auctions. This will make the items more attractive to bidders and increase the likelihood of successful sales.
