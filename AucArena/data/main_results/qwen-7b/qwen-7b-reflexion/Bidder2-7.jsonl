Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid.

If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Based on the bidding history, it seems that all bidders, including Bidder 2, withdrew from the bidding for Widget A. This indicates that none of the bidders were willing to bid on Widget A, possibly due to the item's perceived value or other strategic considerations.\n\nHere's the updated status based on the given information:\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 9000,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 2\": 7000,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 10500\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\n      \"Element R\": 6000,\n      \"Gadget B\": 1100,\n      \"Thingamajig C\": 1200,\n      \"Equipment E\": 2700\n    },\n    \"Bidder 3\": {\n      \"Unit Q\": 6000,\n      \"Machine P\": 6000,\n      \"Implement G\": 3500\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
