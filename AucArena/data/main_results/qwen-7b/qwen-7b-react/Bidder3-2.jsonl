Then, update the status JSON regarding the following information:\n- 'remaining_budget': The remaining budget of you, expressed as a numerical value.\n- 'total_profits': The total profits achieved so far for each bidder, where a numerical value following a bidder's name. No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}. If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"In this round of bidding:\n- Bidder 1 initially bid $3500 but withdrew in Round 1.\n- Bidder 2 bid $4000 and won Contraption I at this price.\n- Bidder 3 initially bid $3500 but withdrew in Round 1.\n\nBased on this, the updated status is as follows:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 20000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1500, \"Bidder 2\": 2000, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Equipment E\": 2500}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Element R\": 6000, \"Thingamajig C\": 1500}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
