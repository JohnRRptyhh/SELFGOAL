Determine and explain if there's a need to update the priority list of remaining items based on the current status. \n3. Present the updated priorities in a JSON format, each item should be represented as a key-value pair, where the key is the item name and the value is its priority on the scale from 1-3. An example output is: {\"Fixture Y\": 3, \"Module B\": 2, \"Product G\": 2}. The descriptions of the priority scale of items are as follows.\n    * 1 - This item is the least important. Consider giving it up if necessary to save money for the rest of the auction.\n    * 2 - This item holds value but isn't a top priority for the bidder. Could bid on it if you have enough budget.\n    * 3 - This item is of utmost importance and is a top priority for the bidder in the rest of the auction."},{"ai":"Based on the current status and the remaining budget, I need to adjust my bidding strategy to maximize my profit.
