This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Secure the item at a price close to the starting price to minimize risk: Monitor the bidding pattern: If other bidders are bidding aggressively, wait for a drop in price or a bidding war to subside. Bid $3200 (your current estimate) initially, then adjust as needed. If the price stays stable or increases, consider bidding $3500 (the next increment) to avoid overpaying. Be prepared to drop out if the true value is significantly lower than your estimate or if your budget starts to dwindle.\n - Keep a close eye on your remaining budget: After securing Apparatus H and Gizmo F, allocate the remaining funds to the remaining items, prioritizing those with higher true value estimates.\n - Bid on Contraption I, $3000: {'Goal': 'Bid on Contraption I with a revised estimate if the true value is within your budget range. If the price is too high, consider waiting for a drop or bidding conservatively.', 'Guidelines': {'If the estimated value is still $6,600': 'Bid $3,500 to $4,000 to maximize profit while staying within your budget.', 'If the true value is lower': 'Bid up to $3,500 and reassess your budget for the next item.', 'If the bidding war is intense': 'Consider dropping out if it exceeds your budget.'}}\n - Secure high-value items with low risk: Focus on items with a smaller price gap between your estimate and the true value. For Implement G and Contraption I, both with an estimated value of $6600, bid conservatively or wait for a better opportunity to minimize risk.\n - Bidding on Implement G (Priority 2): ['If you choose to bid on Implement G, you can start with a bid of $3,300 (your estimated value minus $600 for Unit Q) to avoid overspending.', 'If the bidding continues and the true value is lower, you can adjust your bid accordingly.']\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Contraption I:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $4000\n- Bidder 2: $4000\n- Bidder 3: $3500\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $4300\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n\nRound 2:\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
