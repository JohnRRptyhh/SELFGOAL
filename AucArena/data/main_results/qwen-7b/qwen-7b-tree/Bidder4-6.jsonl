The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Prioritize high-value items: Focus on items with the highest estimated value, such as Mechanism J, Machine P, and Appliance O, as they have the potential to yield a significant profit if bid correctly.\n - Assess competition: Analyze the starting prices and the estimated values of other bidders to understand their bidding patterns. Consider bidding lower if you believe an item is overvalued by others.\n - Diversify your portfolio: Spread your bids across multiple items to minimize the risk of losing on a single high-value item if your estimate is off. This way, you can still make a profit from other items.\n - Be cautious with overestimated items: If an item's estimated value is significantly higher than your personal estimate, it might be a risk to bid too high. Be prepared to walk away if the bidding becomes too competitive.\n - Monitor budget: Keep track of your remaining budget and adjust your bids accordingly. Don't overspend on a single item, as it could limit your ability to bid on other potentially profitable items.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"As Bidder 4, you have a total budget of $20000.

The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Bid aggressively on Mechanism J: If the bidding on Mechanism J starts at $4000, bid immediately to secure it at the starting price. If the bidding goes up, stay within your budget and be prepared to raise your bid if necessary. Monitor the budget closely to avoid overspending.\n - Bid on Appliance O next: If Mechanism J and Machine P are won, bid $4000 to start. Be cautious with the bidding, as it's still a high-value item. Adjust your bid if necessary to stay within your budget.\n - Focus on lower estimated value items: For Apparatus H, Doodad D, and Implement G, bid conservatively, as their estimated values are higher but not as high as Mechanism J and Machine P. For gadgets like Gizmo F and Equipment E, bid around their estimated value or slightly lower to secure them. For widgets and low-value items, consider bidding only if the price is significantly below your estimate.\n - Budget Management: {'Divide your budget': 'Allocate a portion of your budget (e.g., $5000 - $10,000) for the high-value items and the remaining for the lower-value items.', 'Be flexible': 'If you find that a high-value item is too expensive, adjust your budget allocation accordingly. For example, if Mechanism J is too costly, you can shift some funds to the lower-value items.'}\n - Monitoring and Adaptation: {'Keep track of bidding trends': 'Observe the bidding patterns of other bidders to adjust your strategy if needed.', 'Stay informed': \"If an item's true value becomes clearer, adjust your bid accordingly.\"}\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $unknown\n\n* Total Profits:\n\n* Winning Bids:\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Stay within budget: If the bidding goes up rapidly, be cautious not to exceed your remaining budget. If you need to raise your bid, do so incrementally and only if the potential profit justifies the extra cost.\n - Keep track of profits: Maintain a running total of your profits from each bid, so you can adjust your strategy if necessary. If bidding on Mechanism J starts to drain your budget significantly, you might need to reconsider your priorities.\n - Stay within budget: Keep track of your bidding throughout the auction to avoid overspending. If you find that you're close to your budget limit, be prepared to drop out of the bidding on Appliance O.\n - Avoid bidding on high-value items if others are bidding aggressively: {'If Bidder 1 and 2 have already bid $3200': \"It might be a sign that they are confident in the item's value. In this case, you can wait for a drop in bidding or a chance to bid lower.\", 'If no one else bids, bid $3200 only if you are confident in your estimate and have enough budget left': ''}\n - Avoid bidding above your estimated value: If the price rises, consider dropping out if it's no longer cost-effective to continue.

If the true value of an item is significantly higher than your estimate, consider bidding up to a maximum of 80-90% of your estimated value to avoid overspending.\n - Winning strategy: If you have a few high-value items with a lower estimated value, consider bidding on them first to secure a profit, then move on to lower-value items with a higher estimated value to conserve your budget.\n - Secure an item at a lower price: {'Item 2: Apparatus H': 'Keep bidding until the hammer price is reached.', 'Item 10: Widget A': 'If the bidding on Widget A is slow, you can consider bidding lower to secure it at a more affordable price.'}\n - Diversify your portfolio: {'Item 6: Machine P': \"If you can't outbid the competition, consider bidding on other items with lower estimated values to balance your portfolio.\"}\n - Manage your budget: Make sure to monitor your remaining funds closely and adjust your bids accordingly.

Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Equipment E: Bid between $3,520 and $3,960.\n - Save budget for high-value items: If you decide to bid on Gizmo F at $3,520, make sure to allocate the remaining budget ($15,800 - $20,000 = $4,200) strategically for the remaining items. Focus on those with higher estimated values or where you can potentially save more. Equipment E, Widget A, Machine P.\n - Be prepared to raise your bid slightly to secure the item: If multiple bidders are bidding close to your target range, be prepared to raise your bid slightly to secure the item. Remember, the goal is to win at a minimal price.\n - Budget allocation: Allocate the remaining budget of $16,500 wisely, considering the remaining items and their estimated values. Machine P is worth $11,000, so you might need to bid conservatively to ensure you have enough for the other items.\n - Monitor bidding patterns: Keep an eye on the bidding for other items, especially those with similar estimated values. If the bidding for Gadget B starts to rise, it might indicate a higher true value. If it remains at the minimum or lower, it's more likely to be underpriced.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $unknown\n\n* Total Profits:\n\n* Winning Bids:\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

For instance, if the true value of Appliance O is around $7,000, bidding $4,000 initially and then $1,000 more could be more cost-effective.\n - If Equipment E is secured, bid on Machine P with a focus on maximizing profit: {'If Equipment E is won': \"If you have enough budget left, bid around $6500 to $7000, as it's a high-value item with a similar estimated value.\", 'If Equipment E is not won': \"If you need to conserve budget, bid around $5500 to $6000, as it's still a high-value item but with less competition.\"}\n - Be prepared to walk away: If Equipment E's true value is significantly higher than your budget, don't be afraid to let it go. You can use the saved budget to bid on other items that might have a better potential profit.\n - Check the competition: Analyze the bidding patterns of the other bidders. If they are bidding conservatively or have already spent a significant portion of their budget, you might be able to secure Element R at a lower price.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Appliance O:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $5000\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3: $4500\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Manage risk: {'Thingamajig C': \"With a starting price of $1000 and an estimated value of $2200, it's a good opportunity to secure a potentially profitable item without incurring a significant loss. Bid on it if you can get it for around $1500 or less.\", 'Gadget B': 'If the starting price is $1000 and your estimate is $2200, bid around $1500 to $1750. This will allow you to secure the item without overextending your budget.'}\n - Bargain on high-value items: If you've already won some high-value items, you can use your position to negotiate with the remaining bidders. For Mechanism J and Machine P, you might be able to secure them at a lower price if you're willing to walk away from a losing bid.\n - Keep an eye on competition: For items where the competition is intense, like Element R with a high estimated value, be prepared to adjust your bidding strategy. If the true value is significantly higher than your estimate, you might need to be more aggressive to win, but also be cautious not to overspend.\n - Secure the item at a price that maximizes profit, considering the competition: {'If competition is strong': 'If Bidder 1 and 2 are still bidding, bid slightly higher than their last bid to maintain a competitive edge. Aim for a bid around $2750 to $3000, as this is the last bid on the item before you.', 'If competition is weak': \"If they have dropped out, bid around $2500 to $2700 to secure the item at a lower price, as you've already won similar items at a similar price.\", 'Monitor budget': 'Keep in mind your remaining budget and adjust your bid accordingly.'}\n - Determine your risk tolerance: If bidding on Element R at half your estimated value ($5,500) exposes you to a higher risk of losing on other items, consider bidding slightly higher to maintain a buffer. However, be cautious not to exceed your remaining budget.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Thingamajig C:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $1200\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

If the bidding continues to rise, wait for a dip and bid around $1500, considering the estimated value of $2200. If the hammer price is $1500 or below, bid your maximum budget to secure the item.\n - Avoid overextending your budget: Be mindful of your budget constraints and don't bid more than you can afford to win. If you're bidding on an item with a high true value but a high estimated value, consider the risk of overestimation and adjust your bid accordingly. If you're in a bidding war, be prepared to walk away if the price becomes too high.\n - Monitor competition: If the competition for lower-priced items is intense, consider waiting for a better opportunity.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Secure the item at a reasonable price: If the bidding on Thingamajig C starts at $1000, bid $1200 to avoid overpaying. If the bidding continues to rise, wait for a dip and bid around $1500, considering the estimated value of $2200. If the hammer price is $1500 or below, bid your maximum budget to secure the item.\n - Avoid overextending your budget: Be mindful of your budget constraints and don't bid more than you can afford to win. If you're bidding on an item with a high true value but a high estimated value, consider the risk of overestimation and adjust your bid accordingly. If you're in a bidding war, be prepared to walk away if the price becomes too high.\n - Monitor competition: If the competition for lower-priced items is intense, consider waiting for a better opportunity. For example, if you see that others are bidding aggressively on Element R, you might want to wait until the price drops or the item is not as attractive to them.\n - Mechanism J (Value: $8000): {'Strategy': 'Consider using your position to negotiate if remaining bidders are not willing to bid higher. If they are still bidding aggressively, you can drop out of the bidding to secure it at a lower price.', 'Guideline': 'If the hammer price is not reached, wait for the last round when the bidders might be more cautious. If the hammer price is reached, you can still try to negotiate with the winning bidder.'}\n - Machine P (Value: $11000): {'Strategy': 'Use the fact that you have other high-value items in your portfolio to negotiate. If the remaining bidders are interested, offer to trade it for a lower-priced item with higher profit potential.', 'Guideline': 'If the hammer price is not reached, wait for the final round and see if the bidders are willing to part with it for a discount.
