You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Prioritize high-value items: Focus on items with the highest estimated value, such as Appliance O, Utensil N, and Apparatus H, as they have a higher potential to yield a significant return.\n - Analyze bidding patterns: Observe the bidding behavior of other bidders to understand if they are overestimating or underestimating the items. This can help you identify opportunities to bid lower than the true value and potentially win at a lower price.\n - Diversify your bids: Spread your bids across multiple items to avoid bidding on a single item too aggressively and potentially overspending. This way, you can secure a few high-profit items while still having some budget left for potentially undervalued items.\n - Be cautious with high-value items: If you believe your estimated value for a high-value item is significantly off, it might be wise to hold back and wait for a better opportunity to bid. Don't risk bidding too high and potentially losing on a lower-value item that could have a higher profit margin.\n - Manage your budget: Keep track of your remaining budget and adjust your bids accordingly. Don't overspend on any item, as your ultimate goal is to maximize profit with the $20,000 budget.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"As Bidder 4, you have a total budget of $20000.

If you notice a consistent pattern, you can adjust your bidding strategy accordingly.\n - Time-based bidding: If some items were bid on at the end of the auction, it might indicate that the market is more price-sensitive or that bidders are more willing to drop out. Consider bidding earlier on these items to potentially secure a better price.\n - Market research on resale value: Research the resale value of the items after the auction. If the true value is significantly lower than the hammer price, it could be a sign that the auction is not reflecting the true market value.\n - Stay flexible and adapt to changing market conditions: If the bidding on Machine P starts to heat up, be ready to adjust your bid or drop out if necessary.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $unknown\n\n* Total Profits:\n\n* Winning Bids:\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value.

This is an opportunity to bid around $5,000-$6,000, as you suggested, to potentially secure a higher profit.\n - Watch for bidding patterns: If you see that other bidders are consistently bidding above your estimated value, it might be a sign that they are overestimating. In this case, you can wait for a drop in price and then bid around $5,500-$6,000.\n - Final bid: Once you've decided on your bid, make it a decisive one. Don't let the auctioneer raise the price too high, as your goal is to win at the minimum possible price.\n - Manage your budget: If you choose to bid more on Contraption I, make sure to allocate the remaining budget for the other items. Be mindful of their estimated values and potential profit margins.\n - Value analysis: Keep track of the hammer prices for each item. If the true value is consistently lower than your estimated value, you can bid lower to secure a higher profit.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Evaluate true value: Since the hammer price for Machine P was not bid upon, it might be undervalued or have a lower true value than your estimated. This is an opportunity to bid around $5,000-$6,000, as you suggested, to potentially secure a higher profit.\n - Watch for bidding patterns: If you see that other bidders are consistently bidding above your estimated value, it might be a sign that they are overestimating. In this case, you can wait for a drop in price and then bid around $5,500-$6,000.\n - Final bid: Once you've decided on your bid, make it a decisive one. Don't let the auctioneer raise the price too high, as your goal is to win at the minimum possible price.\n - Manage your budget: If you choose to bid more on Contraption I, make sure to allocate the remaining budget for the other items. Be mindful of their estimated values and potential profit margins.\n - Value analysis: Keep track of the hammer prices for each item. If the true value is consistently lower than your estimated value, you can bid lower to secure a higher profit. For example, in the case of Utensil N, you won at $5000, which is $2000 above your estimated value. This suggests that you might be overestimating the value of some items.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Contraption I:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3200\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3: $3500\n- Bidder 4: $3500\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $3800\n\nRound 2:\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Bargain with underbidders: If you see that a bidder has bid below your estimated value for Machine P, consider negotiating with them. You might be able to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, where you both save on the price.\n - Be cautious with the hammer price: If the hammer price for Machine P is not bid, it might be a sign that the true value is lower than the last bid. In this case, you might want to wait for a better opportunity to bid, or consider bidding at a lower price.\n - Mechanism J: {'Goal': \"Bid your maximum value of $11,000 if you're confident in the item's true value.\", 'Guidelines': \"If the hammer price reaches $11,000 or higher, you'll secure a high-profit item. However, if the price doesn't reach that, be prepared to adjust your strategy.\"}\n - Thingamajig C: If you have budget left after Mechanism J and Element R, bid around $1,500 to $2,000 on Thingamajig C. This is a lower-value item, but bidding more than $2,200 would be a waste of money.\n - Doodad D: Doodad D is a mid-range item, so you can bid around $2,500 to $3,000. This will help you save some budget for the remaining high-value items.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $unknown\n\n* Total Profits:\n\n* Winning Bids:\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Analyze their bidding behavior in previous rounds to see if they have a pattern of bidding lower than their actual valuation.\n - Bidding strategies: If Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 are known to have a lower bidding strategy, they might be trying to drive down the price to win at a lower cost. Consider whether they have a reputation for bidding aggressively or if they are new to the auction process.\n - Budget management: If Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 have a limited budget, they might be more likely to bid below your estimated value to secure the item at a more affordable price. However, if they have a significant budget left, their underbidding could be strategic.\n - Bidding Patterns: Analyze the bidding patterns of other bidders to see if they are following a consistent strategy. This can help you predict their future moves.\n - Similar to Doodad D, aim for a profit of $2400.: Bid between $2000 and $3000 (inclusive) to avoid overspending.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Thingamajig C:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $1100\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
