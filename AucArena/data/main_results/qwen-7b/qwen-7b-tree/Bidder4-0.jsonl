B)","0: Prioritize high-value items: Focus on items with the highest estimated value, such as Appliance O, Utensil N, and Apparatus H, as they have a higher potential to yield a significant return.","1: Analyze bidding patterns: Observe the bidding behavior of other bidders to understand if they are overestimating or underestimating the items. This can help you identify opportunities to bid lower than the true value and potentially win at a lower price.","2: Diversify your bids: Spread your bids across multiple items to avoid bidding on a single item too aggressively and potentially overspending. This way, you can secure a few high-profit items while still having some budget left for potentially undervalued items.","3: Be cautious with high-value items: If you believe your estimated value for a high-value item is significantly off, it might be wise to hold back and wait for a better opportunity to bid. You don't want to risk bidding too high and potentially losing on a lower-value item that could have a higher profit margin.","4: Manage your budget: Keep track of your remaining budget and adjust your bids accordingly. Don't overspend on any item, as your ultimate goal is to maximize profit with the $20,000 budget."],["1 (Gadget B)","0: Appliance O (Item 2): Since it has the highest estimated value, your primary focus should be on securing this item. If you can bid $4000 or less, it could be a good deal, given your estimated value of $8800. If the bidding continues to rise, consider waiting for a drop in price or bidding below the true value if you believe it's significantly overestimated.","2: Apparatus H (Item 4): If the price for Apparatus H is still within your budget, bid around $3000 to $3300. This item has a high estimated value, but you might need to be more cautious as it's the next item in the list.","3: Diversify your bids: For the remaining high-value items (Widget A, Unit Q, Machine P, Contraption I, Mechanism J, Element R, Thingamajig C, Doodad D, and Gizmo F), bid conservatively. If your estimated value is accurate, aim to win them at a price around 70-80% of your estimate. This will help you save budget for potentially undervalued items.","9: Target high-value items with room to negotiate: Appliance O and Utensil N have the highest estimated values, but they are already at $4000.

This can help you identify opportunities to bid lower than the true value and potentially win at a lower price.\n - Diversify your bids: Spread your bids across multiple items to avoid bidding on a single item too aggressively and potentially overspending.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Appliance O (Item 2): Since it has the highest estimated value, your primary focus should be on securing this item. If you can bid $4000 or less, it could be a good deal, given your estimated value of $8800. If the bidding continues to rise, consider waiting for a drop in price or bidding below the true value if you believe it's significantly overestimated.\n - Apparatus H (Item 4): If the price for Apparatus H is still within your budget, bid around $3000 to $3300. This item has a high estimated value, but you might need to be more cautious as it's the next item in the list.\n - Diversify your bids: For the remaining high-value items (Widget A, Unit Q, Machine P, Contraption I, Mechanism J, Element R, Thingamajig C, Doodad D, and Gizmo F), bid conservatively. If your estimated value is accurate, aim to win them at a price around 70-80% of your estimate. This will help you save budget for potentially undervalued items.\n - Target high-value items with room to negotiate: Appliance O and Utensil N have the highest estimated values, but they are already at $4000. Look for items where your estimated value is close to the starting price, as you can potentially win at a lower cost. For example, Apparatus H, Unit Q, and Mechanism J have higher estimated values but are still within your budget.\n - Manage your budget: Prioritize bidding on items with a higher profit margin, even if they're not as high-value.

If you've already spent $1320 on Gadget B, you have $18,780 left for the remaining 11 items.\n - Diversification: If you're concerned about bidding too high on Apparatus H, consider bidding on lower-value items first to free up some budget for this high-value item. This way, you can secure a few high-profit items and then focus on Apparatus H if the bidding is still within your budget.\n - Gizmo F: {'Goal': 'Bid around $1400 - $1600', 'Reason': 'Similar to Doodad D, but with a slightly higher value.'}\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Utensil N:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $4200\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $4200\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $4600\n\nRound 2:\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Secure Apparatus H at $4000 or less: Stick to your estimated value of $4000 and bid that amount to maximize profit.

This is a good opportunity to save $2000 for future bids. If the true value is higher, you should adjust your bids for the remaining items accordingly.

However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Win Mechanism J without overspending: {'Value-based bidding': 'Stick to your estimated value for Mechanism J, but be prepared to adjust if the true value is lower.', 'Bidding discipline': \"Avoid bidding too aggressively, especially if you're not confident in your assessment.\", 'Budget monitoring': 'Keep track of your remaining budget and adjust your bids accordingly.', 'Exit strategy': 'If the bidding becomes too expensive, consider dropping out to save your budget for other items.'}\n - Implement G: {'Goal': 'If the price drops to $3000 or below, bid $3000.

However, be prepared to walk away if the true value is still higher than your budgeted amount.\"}\n - Underestimate to overbid: Consider underestimating the true value of Doodad D to create a bidding war with other bidders and secure the item at a lower price.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $unknown\n\n* Total Profits:\n\n* Winning Bids:\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Win Mechanism J without overspending: {'Value-based bidding': 'Stick to your estimated value for Mechanism J, but be prepared to adjust if the true value is lower.', 'Bidding discipline': \"Avoid bidding too aggressively, especially if you're not confident in your assessment.\", 'Budget monitoring': 'Keep track of your remaining budget and adjust your bids accordingly.', 'Exit strategy': 'If the bidding becomes too expensive, consider dropping out to save your budget for other items.'}\n - Implement G: {'Goal': 'If the price drops to $3000 or below, bid $3000.

However, be prepared to walk away if the true value is still higher than your budgeted amount.\"}\n - Underestimate to overbid: Consider underestimating the true value of Doodad D to create a bidding war with other bidders and secure the item at a lower price.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $unknown\n\n* Total Profits:\n\n* Winning Bids:\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1.

Avoid bidding too aggressively, especially if you're not confident in your assessment. If you're unsure about the true value, wait for others to overbid and then counter with a slightly lower amount.

Remember, Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some common practices of bidding:\n1. Showing your interest by bidding with or slightly above the starting price of this item, then gradually increase your bid.\n2. Think step by step of the pros and cons and the consequences of your action (e.g., remaining budget in future bidding) in order to achieve your primary objective.\n3. Consider the given sub-goals and detailed advices, you may choose to focus on some of them to help you decide on your action, or ignore them.\n\nGive your reasons first, then make your final decision clearly. You should either withdraw (saying \"I'm out!\") or make a higher bid for this item (saying \"I bid $xxx!\")."},{"ai":"Reasoning:\n1. Element R has a high estimated value, making it a top priority item.\n2. I have $15,400 left in my budget after previous purchases.\n3.

Thingamajig C, Doodad D, and Gizmo F are lower priority items, and I can afford to let them go if necessary.\n\nDecision: I bid $6000 on Element R!\n\nExplanation: I am bidding $6000 on Element R to show my interest and secure a good profit. This bid is slightly above the starting price to indicate that I am serious about the item and believe it has a higher value than the current price. By bidding this amount, I am within my remaining budget and can still allocate funds for other potentially profitable items. If the true value is higher than my estimate, I will still make a profit, and if it's lower, I won't overspend significantly.

This bid is still above the starting price and shows my interest in the item, but it's a more cautious approach to avoid overspending. If the true value is still within my revised budget, I can secure a profit without risking too much.

I should focus on bidding on items with lower estimated values or those that are more budget-friendly.\n\nDecision: I withdraw from bidding on Element R.\n\nExplanation: Given the current situation and the fact that I can't afford the revised bid, it's best to withdraw from bidding on Element R. This allows me to conserve my remaining budget for other items that may have a better potential for profit or are more within my budget.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Bidding discipline: Maintain a disciplined approach to bidding. Avoid bidding too aggressively, especially if you're not confident in your assessment. If you're unsure about the true value, wait for others to overbid and then counter with a slightly lower amount. This will help you avoid overspending.\n - Budget monitoring: Keep track of your remaining budget closely. After winning Gadget B and Appliance O, you have spent $13,200 and $4,600, respectively. Mechanism J's starting price is $4,000, so you have $15,400 left. Make sure to bid within this budget, and if necessary, adjust your bids for the remaining items to ensure you have enough for Mechanism J.\n - Priority for high-profit items: Since Mechanism J has the highest estimated value, it should be your top priority. If you need to choose between Mechanism J and other items, weigh the potential profit against the risk of overspending. If the true value is lower than your estimate, you might be better off bidding on the undervalued items.\n - Allocate $2000 to Gizmo F: Same as Doodad D, invest $2000 in Gizmo F.\n - Avoid overbidding: To minimize overspending, don't bid more than $1400, even if you think it's a good deal. If the true value is higher, you'll still make a profit, and if it's lower, you won't waste too much.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Element R:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $6000\n- Bidder 2: $6000\n- Bidder 3: $6000\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Element R, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Element R. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.

Avoid overspending on a single item and save your budget for higher-profit opportunities.\n - Time your bids: Try to bid during the middle or end of the auction when the competition might be less intense to win at a lower price.\n - Bid on Thingamajig C: Bid on this item if Mechanism J is already secured or if the true value is significantly lower than your estimate.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Item prioritization: {'Re-evaluate your estimated values': \"Review your initial estimates and consider the possibility that they might be off. If you're consistently overestimating or underestimating, adjust your priorities accordingly.\", 'Focus on underpriced items': 'Look for items where your estimated value is lower than the hammer price. These might be good opportunities to secure a high profit without overspending.', 'Be cautious with overvalued items': 'If your estimated value for an item is significantly higher than the hammer price, it might be a sign that others are also overestimating. Be prepared to walk away if the true value is lower than your budget allows.'}\n - Exit strategies: {'Have a plan for when to walk away': \"If you're bidding on an item and the true value is significantly higher than your estimate, don't be afraid to drop out. Save your budget for better opportunities.\", 'Be mindful of bidding wars': \"If a bidding war breaks out, consider whether it's worth getting into. If the true value is still too high, it might be better to let the item go and save your budget.\"}\n - Post-auction analysis: {'Review your purchases': 'After the auction, analyze your final purchases to see if they were profitable. If some items turned out to be overvalued, adjust your strategy for future auctions.'}\n - Keep a reserve: Set a minimum price for each item you're willing to bid on. This will help you avoid bidding too high and potentially overspending.\n - Bidding strategy: Be patient and wait for the right moment to bid. Consider waiting for the price to drop further for undervalued items and bid only when the price is close to your estimated value or lower for overvalued items.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Gizmo F:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $2500\n- Bidder 2: $2200\n- Bidder 3: $2500\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Gizmo F, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Gizmo F. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.
