If you perceive a high likelihood of a bidding war for a particular item, you might consider bidding slightly lower to secure it at a more favorable price.\n - Diversify your bids: Spread your budget across multiple items to minimize the risk of overexerting on a single high-value item. This way, you can potentially win some lower-value items at a lower cost and still achieve a decent profit.\n - Be flexible: Be prepared to adjust your bids based on the actual value of the items as they are presented. If an item's true value turns out to be lower than your estimate, you can bid more aggressively to win it.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Machine P:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $5500\n- Bidder 2: $5500\n- Bidder 3: $6000\n- Bidder 4: $6000\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $6550\n\nRound 2:\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Be prepared to walk away: If the bidding for Implement G becomes too high and you can't justify the cost, don't hesitate to drop out. Your remaining budget should be allocated to items with a higher potential profit.\n - Consider the true value: If the true value of Implement G turns out to be lower than your estimate, you can bid more aggressively to secure it. However, be cautious not to overestimate the true value, as that could lead to overspending.\n - Contraption I and Utensil N: For these items, bid around $6000 and $4500, respectively, to maintain your position without overspending.\n - Secure Mechanism J at a price close to your estimated value of $8800: Bid $8000 in the first round to avoid bidding wars and maintain a competitive edge. Monitor the bidding patterns of other bidders for any signs of a drop-out or a significant increase in their bids. If necessary, bid up to $9000 in the second round if the true value is higher than your estimate, but be cautious not to exceed your budget.\n - Implement G: Be cautious not to overbid, as your overall budget is limited. If the bidding war is intense, consider bidding slightly below your estimated value to secure it.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Implement G:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $3200\n- Bidder 3: $3500\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Mechanism J: {'Goal': 'Bid conservatively, aiming for a price around $6000 to $6500 to maximize profit.', 'Guideline': \"If the true value is lower than $6000, bid $6000 to secure the item. If it's higher, consider waiting for a better opportunity or bidding on a more profitable item.\"}\n - Element R: {'Goal': \"This is a high-value item, but you've already spent $15,000 on the first two. Bid cautiously, considering the risk.\", 'Guideline': \"If the true value is around $5000, bid $4500 to $5000. If it's higher, wait for a better opportunity or save for the final round.\"}\n - Budget Management: Keep track of your remaining budget and adjust your bids accordingly. If you have a significant portion left, you can afford to be more aggressive on Utensil N. If your budget is tight, consider bidding conservatively or dropping out if the bidding on Utensil N starts to exceed your budget.\n - Bidding Pattern Analysis: Observe the bidding patterns of other bidders to gauge their strategies. If they seem to be bidding aggressively on similar items, you might want to be more cautious with Utensil N to avoid overpaying.\n - Save for the hammer price: If Mechanism J's true value is indeed $8800, you should save your remaining budget for the final round, as you've already won some items at a lower price.

These items have a similar estimated value, and bidding aggressively on both could lead to overexerting your budget.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Optimize bids for $4500-$5000 items: If an item's true value falls within $4500-$5000, bid $4750 to maintain competitiveness without overpaying. Since your estimated value for Widget A is $2200, bidding $4750 would allow you to stay competitive while saving some budget for potentially more profitable items.\n - Be cautious with $4400-$5000 items: For $4400-$5000 items, bid conservatively to maximize profit. These items have a similar estimated value, and bidding aggressively on both could lead to overexerting your budget. Bid on one and consider the other for later.\n - If Element R is bid on, prioritize bidding on Widget A and Gizmo F.: If Element R is bid on by another bidder, focus on the remaining items with higher estimated value. Since Widget A and Gizmo F have the same estimated value, bid on the one that you think is more likely to be underbid or has a lower true value.\n - For Widget A and Gizmo F, bid conservatively to maximize profit.: For each of these items, bid just above the starting price to avoid overpaying. If the true value is lower than your estimate, you can adjust your bid later.\n - Monitor the bidding patterns of other bidders: {'Item 1 (Widget A)': \"Bidders 1 and 2 have already dropped out, which could indicate that they either don't value the item as much or have reached their budget.

This will help you save money for potentially better deals later in the auction.\n - Use psychological bidding to your advantage.: If you suspect a competitor is overestimating an item's value, bid slightly lower to create a bidding war and potentially win at a lower price.

Bidding on it could be a way to save money for potentially better deals later.\n - Bid just above the starting price for all items: For all items, bid just above the starting price to avoid overpaying.
