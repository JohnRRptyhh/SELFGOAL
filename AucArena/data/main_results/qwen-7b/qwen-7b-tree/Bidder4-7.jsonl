Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Prioritize high-value items: Focus on items with the highest estimated value, such as Unit Q, Mechanism J, and Machine P, as they have the potential to yield a significant profit if bid correctly.\n - Analyze bidding competition: Observe the behavior of other bidders and their estimated values. If you believe an item's true value is significantly lower than your estimate, it might be a good opportunity to outbid others, especially if they are overestimating the value.\n - Diversify your portfolio: Spread your bids across multiple items to minimize the risk of losing on a single high-value item if your estimate is off. This way, you can still make a profit from other items.\n - Be cautious with high-risk items: If the true value of an item is close to your estimated value, the bidding competition could be intense.

This is within your budget and could still be a good deal if the true value is close to your estimate.\n - Be cautious with high-value items: If you have a high-value item like Mechanism J or Machine P, you might want to wait for a better opportunity to bid on Unit Q. Don't risk overextending your budget on multiple high-value items.\n - Budget management: Since you have already won Unit Q and Widget A, you have $20,000 - ($10,000 for Unit Q + $2,000 for Widget A) = $8,000 left for Mechanism J and the remaining items.

If they were genuinely interested in the items, their continued bidding would be more consistent.\n - Bidder 4's bidding pattern: You've consistently bid at or above your estimated value, which could be a sign of confidence in your assessment or a strategy to drive up the price. However, you should also be cautious not to exceed your budget.\n - Budget constraints: Bidders who drop out without bidding on a high-value item might be running low on budget. Monitor their behavior to see if they reappear later in the auction or if they bid on lower-value items.\n - General guidelines: {'Stay informed': \"Keep track of the auction's progress and the bidding patterns of other bidders.\", 'Be cautious with high-risk items': 'Avoid bidding on items with a high difference between your estimate and the hammer price, as this increases the risk of overpaying.', 'Be prepared to walk away': \"If an item is too expensive, don't be afraid to drop out and save your budget for a better opportunity.\"}\n - Contraption I: If Mechanism J is secure, you can bid up to $6,000, leaving $400 for Contraption I. This would allow you to secure a good profit from the item while preserving some funds for future bidding.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Contraption I:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3200\n- Bidder 2: $3500\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $3500\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $3800\n\nRound 2:\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

However, you should still be cautious, as they might have had different reasons for dropping out.\n - Bidding strategy: If you decide to bid $6500, you should be prepared for the possibility that the true value might be higher. If the hammer price reaches or exceeds $6500, it could indicate that the true value is closer to that amount. If the price stays below $6500, it might be a sign that the item is overvalued.\n - Value assessment: Since both Bidder 1 and Bidder 3 withdrew, it's possible that the true value of Apparatus H is higher than your estimated $6600. Keep in mind that your previous bids were successful, which suggests you have a good understanding of the bidding dynamics.\n - Budget management: Since you have a remaining budget of $20000, you can allocate a portion of it to Apparatus H without compromising your ability to bid on other items. A conservative estimate for bidding could be around $4000 to $4500, considering the true value could be higher.\n - Dynamic bidding: {'Bidding patterns': 'Analyze your bidding patterns to identify any patterns or trends. For example, do you tend to bid more aggressively on certain types of items?', 'Bidding windows': 'Identify the optimal bidding window for each item.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Bid $6600 if accurate estimate: If your estimated value of $6600 is accurate, bid this amount to maximize profit from the item with the highest estimated value. This is a riskier strategy, as bidding this high could attract competition or push the true value higher.\n - Diversify bidding strategy: If bidding $6600 on Implement G is too risky, consider bidding on lower-value items first to secure some profit and then use the remaining budget for G. This way, you can still make a profit even if the true value of Implement G is lower than your estimate.\n - Budget management: {'Goal': 'Ensure you have enough funds to bid on the remaining items while still having a reserve for potential high-value items.', 'Guideline': 'After bidding on the first few items, review your remaining budget and adjust your bids accordingly.'}\n - Bid on Element R: Since you've already spent $6500 on Machine P, you can bid conservatively on Element R. If your estimate is accurate, bid up to $7500 to maximize profit. If the true value is lower, you might need to reconsider your strategy.\n - Be prepared to adjust: If you decide to bid on Machine P, be ready to adjust your strategy if the true value is lower than your estimate.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Budget management: Make sure you have enough budget to cover the $6600 bid for Element R and still have funds for other potentially profitable items. If bidding on Element R leaves you with a tight budget, consider adjusting your strategy for the remaining items.\n - Be prepared for a bidding war: If you anticipate a bidding war for Element R, you might need to be ready to raise your bid gradually to avoid losing to a more aggressive bidder. Alternatively, you could wait for the price to drop and then bid, hoping that the competition will drive the price down.\n - Save for the final round: If you have a tight budget, save some funds for the last few items, where the true value might be higher or the competition less intense. This will give you a better chance to secure a high-profit item at the end.\n - Budget allocation: Allocate a portion of your budget for potential high-value items, keeping in mind that you've already won some with a higher profit margin. For example, if you've spent $10,000, set aside $5,000 for the remaining items.\n - Bid on Element R: Since you've already spent $6500 on Machine P, you can bid conservatively on Element R. If your estimate is accurate, bid up to $7500 to maximize profit. If the true value is lower, you might need to reconsider your strategy.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Element R:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3: $6000\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
