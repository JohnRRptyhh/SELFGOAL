This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget."},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Gadget B:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $1200\n- Bidder 3: $1100\n- Bidder 4: $1200\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $1400\n\nRound 2:\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
