Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Setting a threshold for maximum bid: Determine a point at which the bid exceeds the predetermined maximum budget, and have a plan for how to proceed if this threshold is reached.\n - Identifying alternative items: Research and identify alternative items or similar products that could be pursued if the bidding for the current item becomes too competitive or exceeds the budget.\n - Risk assessment: Continuously assess the risks involved in the auction and have a plan for mitigating potential losses, such as deciding when to withdraw from the bidding to avoid overpaying for the item.\n - Flexibility in approach: Be prepared to adapt the bidding strategy and resource allocation based on the changing dynamics of the auction, such as unexpected increases in bidding or changes in the perceived value of the item.\n - Market analysis: Gain a deep understanding of the market for the item being auctioned, including current demand, pricing trends, and potential competitors.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $17500\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $1500\n  * Bidder 2: $4000\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Doodad D: $2500\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Machine P: $6000\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Risk assessment: Continuously assess the risks involved in the auction and have a plan for mitigating potential losses, such as deciding when to withdraw from the bidding to avoid overpaying for the item.\n - Strategic decision-making: Cultivate the skill of making rapid and well-informed decisions in response to the evolving circumstances of the auction, such as when to increase bids, when to hold back, or when to change negotiation tactics.\n - Market analysis: Gain a deep understanding of the market for the item being auctioned, including current demand, pricing trends, and potential competitors.\n - Factoring in acquisition costs: Take into account any additional costs associated with acquiring the item, such as auction fees, taxes, or transportation expenses. Consider these costs when setting the maximum bid to ensure that the final profit margin remains favorable.\n - Assessing the item's value: Conduct thorough research to understand the true value of the item being auctioned. Consider factors such as the item's condition, rarity, and market demand to determine its potential resale value and set a maximum bid that aligns with the goal of maximizing profit.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Equipment E:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $2500\n- Bidder 2: $2500\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Equipment E, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Equipment E. \nAs Bidder 1, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Seek feedback: Solicit feedback from other bidders or observers to gain insights into the effectiveness of your communication and identify areas for improvement.\n - Establishing trust: Develop the ability to convey trustworthiness and reliability to other bidders, potentially leading to more cooperative interactions.\n - Finding common ground: Identify shared interests or mutual benefits with other bidders to create a sense of camaraderie and understanding.\n - Active listening: Practice attentive listening to the communication of other bidders, demonstrating respect and interest in their perspectives.\n - Positive communication: Use language and tone that conveys positivity and openness, aiming to create a congenial atmosphere during the auction.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Apparatus H:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $4000\n- Bidder 2: $3500\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
