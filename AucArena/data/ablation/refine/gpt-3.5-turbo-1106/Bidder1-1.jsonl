You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Communication and coordination: If working as part of a team or with a partner, ensure clear communication and coordination to facilitate flexible resource allocation based on the evolving auction dynamics.\n - Contingency planning: Have contingency plans in place for different resource allocation scenarios, such as adjusting the maximum bid or reallocating resources based on the progress of the auction.\n - Monitoring resource utilization: Keep track of the resources allocated to each bid and assess their impact on potential profitability, adjusting the allocation as necessary to maintain efficiency.\n - Assessing the auction dynamics: Develop the ability to quickly analyze the changing dynamics of the auction, including the behavior of other bidders, the pace of bidding, and the overall atmosphere.\n - Strategic decision-making: Cultivate the skill of making rapid and well-informed decisions in response to the evolving circumstances of the auction, such as when to increase bids, when to hold back, or when to change negotiation tactics.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Equipment E:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $2500\n- Bidder 2: $3000\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

The true value for Equipment E is $4000.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Equipment E. \nAs Bidder 1, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding. Here's your previous status:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $7000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $9000\n  * Bidder 2: $9600\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Gizmo F: $2500\n    * Apparatus H: $3500\n    * Element R: $5500\n    * Thingamajig C: $1500\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Contraption I: $3500\n    * Unit Q: $6000\n    * Mechanism J: $4900\n```\n\nSummarize the notable behaviors of all bidders in this round of bidding for future reference. Then, update the status JSON regarding the following information:\n- 'remaining_budget': The remaining budget of you, expressed as a numerical value.\n- 'total_profits': The total profits achieved so far for each bidder, where a numerical value following a bidder's name. No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}. If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Based on the bidding history, Bidder 1 initially bid $2500 for Equipment E, but withdrew from the bidding when Bidder 2 raised the bid to $3000.
