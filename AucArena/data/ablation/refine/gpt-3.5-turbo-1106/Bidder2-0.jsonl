This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Identify comparable items: Identify items that are similar in nature, condition, and rarity to the item being auctioned to establish a basis for comparison.\n - Analyze recent sale prices: Research recent sales of comparable items to understand their market value and determine a benchmark for the item being auctioned.\n - Consider variations: Take into account any variations in the item, such as different editions, sizes, or historical significance, and how these variations may impact its value.\n - Brief guidelines: ['Utilize online auction platforms, specialized auction houses, and market databases to gather data on recent sales of similar items.', 'Look for items that closely match the characteristics of the item being auctioned, such as artist, age, condition, and provenance.', 'Take note of any specific details or unique features of the item being auctioned that may differentiate it from comparable items and influence its value.', 'Consider reaching out to experts or collectors in the specific category of the item to gain insights into the market value and demand for similar items.']\n - Analyze historical auction data: Study past auction results for similar items to identify patterns in pricing, demand, and bidder behavior.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Implement G:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3500\n- Bidder 2: $3200\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold! Implement G to Bidder 1 at $3500! The true value for Implement G is $6000.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Implement G. \nAs Bidder 2, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding. Here's your previous status:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $9300\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $6500\n  * Bidder 2: $7300\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Apparatus H: $3500\n    * Machine P: $6000\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Gadget B: $1200\n    * Appliance O: $5000\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n```\n\nSummarize the notable behaviors of all bidders in this round of bidding for future reference. Then, update the status JSON regarding the following information:\n- 'remaining_budget': The remaining budget of you, expressed as a numerical value.\n- 'total_profits': The total profits achieved so far for each bidder, where a numerical value following a bidder's name. No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}. If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"In this round of bidding, Bidder 1 won Implement G with a winning bid of $3500, which is lower than the true value of $6000. Bidder 2 withdrew from the bidding, resulting in a loss of the item.\n\nBased on this round of bidding, the updated status is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 9300,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 6500,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 7300\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Apparatus H\": 3500,\n      \"Machine P\": 6000,\n      \"Implement G\": 3500\n    },\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\n      \"Gadget B\": 1200,\n      \"Appliance O\": 5000,\n      \"Mechanism J\": 4500\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
