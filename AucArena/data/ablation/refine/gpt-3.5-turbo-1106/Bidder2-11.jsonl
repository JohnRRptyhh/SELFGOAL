If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Summary of notable behaviors in this round of bidding:\n- Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 both bid $6000 for Element R.\n- Bidder 1 withdrew after Round 1.\n- Bidder 2 also withdrew after Round 1.\n\nUpdated status JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 18800,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 5000,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 800\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Utensil N\": 4500,\n      \"Gizmo F\": 2500\n    },\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\n      \"Widget A\": 1200\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
