Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Identify comparable items: Identify items that are similar in nature, condition, and rarity to the item being auctioned to establish a basis for comparison.\n - Analyze recent sale prices: Research recent sales of comparable items to understand their market value and determine a benchmark for the item being auctioned.\n - Assessing the item's value: Conduct thorough research to understand the true value of the item being auctioned. Consider factors such as the item's condition, rarity, and market demand to determine its potential resale value and set a maximum bid that aligns with the goal of maximizing profit.\n - Adapt bidding strategy: Be prepared to adapt the bidding strategy based on real-time information and changes in the auction dynamics, such as increased competition or shifts in perceived value, to maintain a competitive edge\n - Assess the competition: It's crucial to accurately gauge the level of competition and the willingness of other bidders to engage in bidding wars, as this can inform strategic adjustments to bidding tactics and resource allocation\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $20000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $1500\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Equipment E: $2500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.
