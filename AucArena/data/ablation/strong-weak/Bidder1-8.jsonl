This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Focus on Items with Estimated Values Close to True Value: Prioritize bidding on items where your estimated value is closer to the true value, as this will maximize your potential profit margin.\n - Risk Assessment for High-Value Items: Assess the risk of overestimating or underestimating the true value of high-value items and adjust your bidding strategy to minimize potential losses while maximizing potential profits.\n - Strategic Prioritization: Prioritize the remaining items based on their estimated value and the potential for profit. Allocate more funds to items with higher estimated values and profit potential.\n - Prioritize High-Value Items: Focus on aggressively pursuing items with higher estimated values, such as Appliance O, Mechanism J, and Unit Q, as winning these items at a reasonable bid could result in a higher profit margin.\n - Minimize Potential Losses: Focus on minimizing potential losses by carefully evaluating the risk associated with each item and making informed decisions to secure winning bids at prices closer to the true value, thus maximizing potential profits.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Appliance O:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $4200\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Strategic Item Selection: Evaluate the remaining items in the auction and identify the ones with the highest profit potential based on your estimated value. Prioritize these items for strategic bidding and aim to outmaneuver Bidder 2 in securing them.\n - Assess the Competition: Continuously monitor the behavior and bidding patterns of other bidders to anticipate their strategies and adjust your own bidding approach accordingly. This will help you to secure items with the highest potential profit margin.\n - Reassess Estimated Values: Review and reassess the estimated values for high-value items such as Unit Q, Mechanism J, and Utensil N. Consider factors such as the previous winning bids and the true values of the items to adjust your estimations accordingly.\n - Budget Allocation: Allocate your remaining budget strategically, considering the potential discrepancies in true values for high-value items. Ensure that you have sufficient funds to compete for these items while also leaving room to secure them at a bid close to their true value.\n - Risk Assessment: Assess the risk of overbidding on lower-value items such as Widget A and Thingamajig C, and consider allocating a smaller portion of the budget for these items.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $14000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $4000\n  * Bidder 2: $5600\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Machine P: $6000\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Appliance O: $4200\n    * Gizmo F: $2200\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Analyze Profit Potential: Analyze the estimated value of each remaining item and compare it to the starting price. Identify the items with the highest potential profit margin based on the difference between the estimated value and the starting price.\n - Identify Weaknesses in Competitors' Strategies: Look for any weaknesses or vulnerabilities in the strategies of other bidders, such as a tendency to overbid on certain types of items or a reluctance to engage in bidding wars. Exploit these weaknesses to secure items with higher potential profit margins.\n - Analyze Previous Winning Bids: Review the winning bids for items such as Machine P, Appliance O, and Gizmo F to understand the discrepancy between your estimated values and the true values. This analysis can help in adjusting your estimations for similar items in the remaining auction.\n - Consider Budget Constraints: Take into account your remaining budget of $14000 and prioritize the reassessment of estimated values for high-value items such as Unit Q, Mechanism J, and Utensil N, as winning these items can significantly impact your total profit.\n - Adjust Estimations: Based on the analysis of previous winning bids, budget constraints, and competition, make adjustments to the estimated values for the remaining items. Consider factors such as the market demand for each item and the potential resale value to make informed estimations.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Equipment E:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Equipment E, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Equipment E. \nAs Bidder 1, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.
