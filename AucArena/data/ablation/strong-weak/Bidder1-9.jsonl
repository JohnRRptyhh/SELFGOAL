Consider the potential impact on your budget and overall profit if you were to win or lose the bid for each item.\n - Maximize Profit Margin: Aim to win items at the lowest possible bids to maximize the profit margin. Consider the balance between securing items and managing the budget effectively to achieve the overall goal of maximizing profit.\n - Risk Management: Consider the potential risk of overestimating or underestimating the true value of the remaining items and adjust your bidding strategy accordingly to minimize losses and maximize profits.\n - Analyze Previous Bidding Outcomes: Review the bidding outcomes of the previous items to identify any patterns or discrepancies between your estimated values and the true values.
