This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Stay disciplined and avoid overbidding on items: Ensure that winning bids are as minimal as possible, allowing for maximum profit within the remaining budget.\n - Maximize profit: Keep the primary goal of maximizing profit in mind and use the information about Bidder 2's behavior to make informed decisions that will contribute to achieving this goal.\n - Continuously reassess the estimated values of the remaining items and compare them with the remaining budget to make informed decisions on which items to prioritize in the upcoming rounds of the auction: \n - Monitor the bidding behavior of other participants and adjust your strategy to focus on items that align with your estimated value, while also considering the potential resale value in the broader market: Stay aware of other participants' bidding behavior and adjust your strategy to prioritize items that align with your estimated value, taking into account potential resale value.\n - Pay attention to items that received no bids: Focus on items that received no bids in previous rounds, as they may have been overlooked by other bidders and present an opportunity to secure them at a lower price.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Implement G:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3500\n- Bidder 2: $3500\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Implement G, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Implement G. \nAs Bidder 1, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.
