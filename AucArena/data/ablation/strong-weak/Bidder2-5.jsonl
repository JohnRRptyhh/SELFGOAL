If you notice that a competitor has a limited budget, you may be able to secure an item at a lower price by waiting for them to drop out.\n - Be Prepared to Walk Away: If the bidding exceeds your maximum bid, be prepared to withdraw from that item. There will be other opportunities, and it's important to keep your budget intact for items that may offer better profit potential.\n - Profit Over Winning: Remember that the goal is to maximize profit, not necessarily to win the most items.

This will help you focus your budget on the items that could yield the most profit.\n - Set Maximum Bids: For each high-margin item, determine a maximum bid that allows for a healthy profit while considering the risk of overestimation. This bid should be below your estimated value but high enough to give you a competitive chance of winning.\n - Reserve Budget for Later Items: Be mindful that there are still many items left to bid on. It's important to reserve a portion of your budget for items that will come up later, as you may have better opportunities to win them at a lower price if other bidders' budgets are depleted.\n - Monitor Your Budget: Keep track of your remaining budget and adjust your maximum bids for future items. As you win items and your budget decreases, you may need to lower your maximum bids to avoid running out of funds.\n - Track Cumulative Profit: Keep a running total of your cumulative profit after each item is won. This will help you understand your position relative to other bidders and inform your strategy for the remaining items.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Utensil N:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $5000\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Profit Maximization: Aim to win items where the difference between your estimated value and the starting price is greatest, as this offers the highest potential profit margin.\n - Budget Allocation: Consider how to allocate the remaining budget across the 9 items, prioritizing those with the best profit potential.\n - Calculate Potential Profit Margins: Determine the potential profit margin for each remaining item by calculating the difference between your estimated value and the starting price.\n - Monitor Remaining Budget: Ensure that you have enough funds to bid on multiple high-margin items and avoid depleting your budget unnecessarily.\n - Set Maximum Bids: For each remaining item, determine a maximum bid that allows for a reasonable profit margin while considering the risk of overestimation. Do not exceed this maximum bid to avoid overspending.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $13800\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $3800\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Gadget B: $1200\n    * Utensil N: $5000\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value.

These items offer a higher potential profit margin, which can help you close the profit gap with Bidder 1.\n - Monitor Bidder 1's Budget: Keep track of Bidder 1's remaining budget. If they start to run low on funds, they may become more conservative in their bidding, which could give you an advantage on later items.\n - Cap Your Bids: Set a maximum bid for each item based on its estimated value and stick to it. This will help you avoid overbidding and ensure that any item you win will contribute to your profit.\n - Save Budget for Later Rounds: With several items remaining, it's important to maintain enough budget to participate in the bidding for all items. This will give you flexibility and the ability to capitalize on opportunities as they arise.\n - Calculate Expected Profit Margins: For each remaining item, calculate the difference between your estimated value and the starting price.

Winning an item is only beneficial if it contributes to your overall profit. Avoid winning items for the sake of winning if the price does not allow for a sufficient profit margin.\n - Assess Profit Potential: With an estimated value of $6600 for Implement G and a starting price of $3000, there is a potential profit margin of $3600.
