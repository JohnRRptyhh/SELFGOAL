Since you don't know the exact starting budget of Bidder 1, you can't calculate their remaining budget precisely, but you can infer that it's less than yours.\n - Predict Competitor's Bidding Behavior: Given that Bidder 1 has already made a profitable purchase, they may be more conservative in future bids to maintain their lead. Alternatively, they may feel confident and continue to bid aggressively. Observe their behavior in the next few items to gauge their strategy.\n - Reserve Budget for Later Rounds: As the auction progresses, other bidders may deplete their budgets, potentially allowing you to secure items at lower prices. Keep enough budget in reserve to take advantage of this.\n - Bid Ceiling: Establish a bid ceiling for each item, which is the maximum amount you're willing to bid. This should be less than your estimated value to ensure a profit if you win.\n - Prioritize High Profit Potential Items: Identify the items with the highest potential profit margins based on your estimated values. For example, Unit Q and Utensil N both have high estimated values compared to their starting prices, which could offer significant profits.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Gizmo F:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $2200\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Apparatus H has a starting price of $3000 and an estimated value of $6600, which offers a potential profit margin of $3600. This item should be a priority.\n - Set Maximum Bids: Determine the maximum bid for each item while ensuring a profit margin.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1.

Given the estimated value of $2200, a conservative maximum bid might be set at around $1500-$1700 to maintain a safe profit margin.\n - Consider the Profit Lead: You currently have a profit lead of $10700 compared to Bidder 1's $8000. Winning Widget A with a good profit margin could solidify this lead. However, if the price goes beyond a profitable range, it may be wise to let it go and maintain the profit lead.\n - Endgame Strategy: As this is the last item, there's no need to conserve budget for future bids. Use this to your advantage by being willing to bid up to your maximum limit, knowing there are no further items to save for.\n - Winning Isn't Everything: Remember that winning the item is not the primary goal; maximizing profit is.
