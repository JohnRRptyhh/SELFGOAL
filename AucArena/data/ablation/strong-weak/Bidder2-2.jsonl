Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Prioritize High Margin Items: Focus on items where the difference between your estimated value and the starting price is greatest. This will allow you to potentially make higher profits while using less of your budget.\n - Set Maximum Bids: For each item, determine a maximum bid that allows for a reasonable profit margin. Do not exceed this bid to avoid overpaying and depleting your budget on items with lower profit potential.\n - Analyze Opponent's Behavior: Bidder 1 has shown a willingness to bid on a lower-priced item (Gadget B) but withdrew from a higher-priced item (Appliance O). This could indicate a strategy or budget constraint. Watch for patterns in Bidder 1's behavior to predict their future bidding.\n - Conserve Budget for Later Rounds: With many items left, it's important to conserve budget for later rounds where you might have better information on competitors' remaining funds and can make more informed decisions.\n - Avoid Emotional Bidding: Stick to your calculated maximum bids and avoid getting caught up in the heat of the moment, which can lead to overspending.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Utensil N:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Utensil N, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Utensil N. \nAs Bidder 2, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Prioritize High Margin Items: Focus on items with the highest potential profit margins, such as Unit Q, Machine P, and Element R, as winning these could significantly increase your total profit.\n - Allocate Budget Strategically: With a remaining budget of $14,300, allocate funds to target multiple high-margin items rather than spending a large portion on a single item. This diversification can help mitigate risk and increase the likelihood of overall profit.\n - Analyze Bidder 1's Behavior: Bidder 1 has only won one item (Gadget B) and withdrew from bidding on the other items. This suggests that Bidder 1 may be conservative or has a limited budget. Keep track of the types of items they bid on and their withdrawal points to predict their future behavior.\n - Maintain Profit Lead: With a current profit lead, you can afford to lose some items if the price goes beyond a reasonable profit margin. Don't get caught in the heat of the moment and overbid.\n - Conserve Budget: With a current lead in total profits, you can afford to be more selective with your bids.

However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Assess Remaining High-Value Items: With a remaining budget of $8300, focus on items that have a high estimated value relative to their starting price. Machine P and Element R both have high estimated values ($11000) with a starting price of $5000, offering a potential profit margin of $6000 if acquired at the starting price.\n - Prioritize Based on Budget: Since you cannot afford to win both Machine P and Element R at their estimated values with your current budget, decide which one to prioritize based on the competition and your assessment of their true market value.\n - Avoid Overbidding: Remember that your estimated values could be off. Avoid getting caught up in bidding wars that could lead to overpaying for an item.\n - Endgame Strategy: As you approach the final items, reassess your position. If you are leading in profits, you may choose to be more conservative to protect your lead. If you need to catch up, you might take calculated risks on the remaining high-margin items.\n - Be Ready to Walk Away: If the bidding exceeds your maximum bid limit, be prepared to walk away from the item. There will be other opportunities, and preserving your budget is crucial for future bids.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Machine P:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Machine P, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Machine P. \nAs Bidder 2, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.

You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Prioritize High Profit Margin Items: With a limited budget, it's crucial to focus on items that offer the highest potential profit margin. Based on your estimated values, Element R and Mechanism J have the highest potential profit margins. However, their starting prices are also high, which means they could consume a significant portion of your remaining budget.\n - Keep Track of Profit Goals: Continuously update your total profit after each item is auctioned and compare it with other bidders to ensure you are on track to achieve your goal.\n - Conserve Budget for Best Opportunities: With a remaining budget of $5800, it's crucial to conserve funds for the items that offer the best profit potential. Avoid spending all your budget on early items and missing out on later opportunities.\n - Preserve the Lead: With a significant lead in profits, your primary goal should be to preserve this lead. This means avoiding unnecessary risks that could lead to losses or a significant reduction in your budget.\n - Maintain Profit Focus: Continue to bid on items where the potential profit margin is high, and the competition from Bidder 1 is likely to be low.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Profit Maximization Confirmation: Confirm that the profits you've calculated match the auction log and that no errors have been made in the calculation process.\n - Observe Competitors: Even though you cannot participate in the bidding for the last item, observe the behavior of other bidders. This information may be valuable for future auctions or for post-auction analysis.\n - Prepare for Auction Close: Ensure that all administrative tasks are in order for the items you have won, such as arranging payment and discussing delivery or pickup details.\n - Resale Strategy: If the auction allows for resale, plan how you will sell the items you've acquired to realize the profits. This may involve finding buyers who are willing to pay at or above the true value of the items.\n - Reflect on Bidding Strategy: Take this opportunity to reflect on your bidding strategy throughout the auction. Consider what worked well and what could be improved for future auctions.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Implement G:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Implement G, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Implement G. \nAs Bidder 2, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.
