Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1.

You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Identify the Threshold: Review the past bids where Bidder 1 won and note the maximum percentage increase over the starting price they were willing to go. This will give you an idea of their comfort zone threshold.\n - Predict Bidder 1's Behavior: Use the threshold identified to predict Bidder 1's likely maximum bid for the remaining items. This can help you decide whether to bid just above their comfort zone to secure an item or let them have it if it goes beyond a profitable margin for you.\n - Calculate Break-Even Points: Know the break-even bid for each item, where the bid equals the true value. Aim to win below this point to ensure a profit.\n - Exit Strategy: Have a clear exit strategy for each item. Know when to withdraw from bidding to preserve your budget for items with better profit potential.\n - Stay Within Budget: Ensure that the sum of your maximum bids does not exceed your remaining budget of $5000.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Doodad D:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $2500\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Stay Focused on Profit: Remember that the goal is to maximize profit, not necessarily to win the item. If the bidding goes beyond your set maximum bid limit, be prepared to withdraw to avoid a loss.\n - Profit Preservation: Your current total profit is $12500, which is slightly higher than Bidder 1's profit. Since you cannot bid on Apparatus H or Unit Q, your focus should be on preserving this profit margin by not making any moves that could result in a loss.\n - Target Gadget B: Given its starting price of $1000 and your estimated value of $2200, Gadget B is the only remaining item you can afford and still potentially make a profit. Your goal should be to secure Gadget B without exceeding your remaining budget.\n - Consider the Profit Margin: Always keep in mind the profit margin you aim to achieve with Gadget B. Winning the bid at a price that leaves no profit or an insignificant profit margin would not align with the goal of maximizing profit.\n - Stay Focused on the End Goal: Remember that the end goal is to maximize profit, not necessarily to win every item. If the situation arises where you cannot secure Gadget B within the profit margin, it may be better to retain your remaining budget and accept the current profit standing.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $2500\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $8300\n  * Bidder 2: $12500\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Element R: $6000\n    * Utensil N: $4500\n    * Widget A: $1200\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Equipment E: $2500\n    * Gizmo F: $2500\n    * Appliance O: $4500\n    * Machine P: $5500\n    * Doodad D: $2500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Profit Optimization: Aim to win Gadget B at the lowest price possible to maximize your profit. Every dollar saved is an increase in your total profit.\n - Stay Within Budget: Do not exceed your remaining budget of $2500. This is an absolute limit, and going beyond it is not an option.\n - Consider the Profit Gap: You are currently behind Bidder 1 by $2400 in total profits. Winning Gadget B with a profit of $1200 would not surpass Bidder 1's total profits, but it would narrow the gap. Ensure that any bid you make keeps you within reach of potentially winning the auction overall.\n - Assess the Remaining Item: With only one item left (Gadget B) and a starting price of $1000, evaluate whether bidding on this item aligns with the profit preservation goal. Consider the estimated value for Gadget B and the potential profit if acquired within the remaining budget.\n - Final Item Focus: Since Gadget B is the final item and within your budget, you can focus all your attention and remaining resources on this bid without worrying about saving funds for future items.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Gadget B:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $1100\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format.
