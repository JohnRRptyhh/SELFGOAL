It's better to win fewer items with a higher profit margin than to win many items with slim or negative margins.\", 'Budget Watch': \"Keep track of the remaining budget. As the auction progresses, ensure that you have enough funds to bid on later items, which might be acquired at better prices as other bidders' budgets deplete.\", 'True Value Consideration': 'Remember that the estimated value might not reflect the true value.

If they have less budget remaining than you do, you may have an advantage in bidding for the remaining items. Use this to your advantage, but be cautious not to get drawn into a bidding war that would reduce your profit margin.","7: Prioritize High-Profit Items: Focus on items where the estimated value minus the starting price gives you the highest potential profit margin. For the remaining items, this would be Implement G, with a potential profit of $3,600 if you can secure it at the starting price.","24: Profit Maximization: Focus on the cumulative profit rather than individual item profits. Winning an item with a smaller profit margin is acceptable if it contributes positively to your overall profit. Keep track of Bidder 1's activity, as they are currently leading in total profits. Look for opportunities to outbid them on items where they may be overextending.","57: Balance Risk and Reward: You need to make up a profit difference of $4,600. This means you may need to take calculated risks but do so in a way that does not jeopardize your entire budget."],["13 (Doodad D)","9: Bidder 1's Maximum Bid: Knowing that Bidder 1 has a maximum of $3,800 left, you can safely bid up to $3,800 on an item you want without being outbid.

Balance the need for profit with the need to win items.","62: Assess Remaining Budget and Potential Profit: With a remaining budget of $11,200, carefully consider the potential profit for each remaining item.

If they have overextended themselves, they may be less competitive in the upcoming bids, giving you an opportunity to secure items at lower prices.","49: Set a Maximum Bid Limit: To ensure a profit, you need to set a maximum bid for Implement G that is below your estimated value but also takes into account the need to outbid Bidder 1. Given your remaining budget, you could theoretically bid up to $6600, but this would leave no room for profit. A more conservative approach would be to set a maximum bid at a point where you can still ensure a reasonable profit margin, such as $5000 or $5500.","50: Consider the Current Profit Standings: Bidder 1 currently has a profit of $11800, while you have $8700. To surpass Bidder 1's profit, you need to secure Implement G at a price that allows for a profit greater than $3100.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Set Maximum Bids: Determine a maximum bid for each item that is below your estimated value but above the starting price. This maximum bid should factor in the potential profit margin and the need to conserve budget for later items. For example, if your estimated value for Widget A is $2200 and the starting price is $1000, you might set a maximum bid of $1800 to ensure a profit of at least $400 if your estimation is accurate.\n - Track Competitor Behavior: Keep an eye on how much Bidder 1 and any other bidders are spending and winning. If they are nearing their budget limits, you may have an opportunity to secure items at lower prices as their ability to bid aggressively diminishes.\n - Selective Bidding: Focus on items with a high potential profit margin, where the difference between your estimated value and the starting price is significant. This will allow you to make more substantial profits even with fewer items won.\n - Exit Thresholds: Establish clear exit thresholds for each item, which is the maximum bid you're willing to place based on your estimated value and desired profit margin.\n - Allocate Budget for Key Items: With a remaining budget of $15,500, decide which items are must-wins for you and allocate a portion of your budget to secure them. Ensure you have enough funds to bid on these items without getting into a bidding war that would deplete your budget.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Widget A:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $1100\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Prioritize High-Margin Items: Focus on items where the estimated value is significantly higher than the starting price, such as Thingamajig C, Doodad D, Gizmo F, and Implement G. These items offer a higher potential profit margin, which aligns with a conservative bidding strategy.\n - Profit Tracking: Keep a running total of your profits. You need to outpace Bidder 1's current profit of $11,800. Aim to win items where you can secure enough profit to surpass Bidder 1's total.\n - Balance Risk and Reward: While high-margin items are attractive, they may also carry higher risk if your estimated value is off. Balance the potential reward with the risk by not overcommitting to any single item.\n - Reserve Funds for Later Items: Since there are several items left, it's wise to reserve part of your budget for later items where competition may be less intense, allowing you to secure them at better prices.\n - Endgame Strategy: As the auction nears its end, reassess your position. If you are leading in profits, you may choose to be more conservative to maintain your lead. If you need to catch up, you might take calculated risks on the remaining items.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Thingamajig C:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Thingamajig C, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Thingamajig C. \nAs Bidder 2, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item.

If they have overextended themselves, they may be less competitive in the upcoming bids, giving you an opportunity to secure items at lower prices.\n - Set a Maximum Bid Limit: To ensure a profit, you need to set a maximum bid for Implement G that is below your estimated value but also takes into account the need to outbid Bidder 1. Given your remaining budget, you could theoretically bid up to $6600, but this would leave no room for profit. A more conservative approach would be to set a maximum bid at a point where you can still ensure a reasonable profit margin, such as $5000 or $5500.\n - Consider the Current Profit Standings: Bidder 1 currently has a profit of $11800, while you have $8700. To surpass Bidder 1's profit, you need to secure Implement G at a price that allows for a profit greater than $3100.
