If they are bidding aggressively, it may be wise to let them win certain items to deplete their budget, leaving you in a better position for later items.","4: Reserve Budget for Later Rounds: Anticipate that some items later in the auction may have less competition as other bidders' budgets diminish. Keep enough budget in reserve to take advantage of these opportunities.","3: Avoid Bidding Wars: If a bidding war starts, be prepared to withdraw to avoid overpaying. Remember that winning at too high a price can negate your profit.","2: Set Maximum Bids: For each remaining item, determine the maximum bid you are willing to make based on your estimated value.

Don't put all your budget into a single item unless the profit margin is guaranteed and substantial.","1: Set Maximum Bids: For each remaining item, calculate a maximum bid that allows for a reasonable profit margin. This maximum bid should be below your estimated value of the item but high enough to give you a chance to win the item. Do not exceed this maximum bid during the auction.","26: Calculate Potential Profit After Each Win: After winning an item, subtract the winning bid from your estimated value to calculate the profit. Add this to your total profit and subtract the winning bid from your remaining budget.","30: Calculate Profit Margins: Before bidding, calculate the potential profit margin for each item.

Do not make a bid that could result in a net loss when considering the potential true value of the item.","7: Allocate Budget for Multiple Wins: If possible, spread your remaining budget across multiple items rather than spending it all on one. This diversifies your risk and increases the chances of securing a profit.","20: Calculate Maximum Bids: For each remaining item, calculate the maximum bid you can make while still ensuring a profit. For example, with Implement G, your estimated value is $6600, and the starting price is $3000. To maintain a profit, you should bid no more than your estimated value minus a safety margin to account for potential overestimation.","25: Assess Bidder 1's Budget: Since Bidder 1 has only won one item (Machine P for $6000) and their total profits are $4000, we can deduce that their remaining budget is at least $14,000 ($20,000 starting budget - $6000 spent + $4000 profit). This means they have a significantly larger remaining budget than you do ($5700).","28: Maintain Profit Lead: Since you currently have the highest total profits, your main goal is to maintain or extend this lead.

This margin should be based on the level of confidence in your estimated values and the observed bidding behavior of other participants.","15: Prioritize High-Profit Items: With a limited budget, focus on items where the estimated value minus the starting price offers the highest potential profit. Implement G and Utensil N seem to have good profit margins based on your estimated values.","29: Monitor Competitor's Budget: If Bidder 1 has less budget remaining than you, they may be more conservative in their bidding. Use this to your advantage by potentially securing items at a lower price.","40: Keep Track of Your Profits and Remaining Budget: After each item, update your records to reflect your new budget and total profits.

It's better to let an item go than to win it at a price that eliminates your profit margin.","49: Maintain Profit Lead: Your current total profit is $11700, which is higher than Bidder 1's $6800.

Instead, plan to spread your bids across multiple items to increase the chances of winning several with good profit margins.","47: Prioritize High Margin Items: Utensil N offers the highest potential profit margin.

With only two items left, it's unlikely that Bidder 1 can outbid you profit-wise without taking significant risks. Therefore, you can afford to be more conservative in your bidding.","30: Final Profit Calculation: Remember that your goal is to maximize profit, not necessarily to win more items. If the price of the remaining items goes beyond a point where you can make a profit, it's better to walk away and retain your current profit margin.","55: Target High Profit Margin Items: Focus on the items that have the potential to yield the highest profit margin within your budget.

If they are bidding aggressively, it may be wise to let them win certain items to deplete their budget, leaving you in a better position for later items.\n - Reserve Budget for Later Rounds: Anticipate that some items later in the auction may have less competition as other bidders' budgets diminish. Keep enough budget in reserve to take advantage of these opportunities.\n - Avoid Bidding Wars: If a bidding war starts, be prepared to withdraw to avoid overpaying. Remember that winning at too high a price can negate your profit.\n - Set Maximum Bids: For each remaining item, determine the maximum bid you are willing to make based on your estimated value. This should be less than your estimated value to ensure a profit margin. For example, if your estimated value for Doodad D is $4400, you might decide that your maximum bid is $3500 to maintain a potential profit of $900.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $20000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * No winning bids\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Don't put all your budget into a single item unless the profit margin is guaranteed and substantial.\n - Set Maximum Bids: For each remaining item, calculate a maximum bid that allows for a reasonable profit margin. This maximum bid should be below your estimated value of the item but high enough to give you a chance to win the item. Do not exceed this maximum bid during the auction.\n - Calculate Potential Profit After Each Win: After winning an item, subtract the winning bid from your estimated value to calculate the profit. Add this to your total profit and subtract the winning bid from your remaining budget.\n - Calculate Profit Margins: Before bidding, calculate the potential profit margin for each item. This is the difference between your estimated value and the starting bid.
