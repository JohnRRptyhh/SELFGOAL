If there is a history of bidding wars on these items, be prepared to adjust your strategy accordingly.\n - Budget allocation: Ensure that you have enough budget reserved for potential bidding wars on lower-value items, while also considering the remaining higher-value items in the auction.\n - Risk assessment: Evaluate the potential risks and rewards of participating in bidding for lower-value items.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Adjust budget allocation: Based on the profits and remaining budget, reassess and adjust your budget allocation for the remaining items, considering the potential impact of market conditions on their true values.\n - Avoid overbidding: Be cautious not to overbid on items, especially if the true value is significantly lower than your estimated value, as this could reduce the potential profit margin.\n - Monitor previous bids: Review the bidding history of the auction to identify any patterns or trends that can inform your strategy for the remaining items.\n - Consider the competition: Take into account the bidding behavior of other bidders. If a particular item has consistently attracted high bids, consider the potential competition and adjust your bidding strategy accordingly.\n - Strategic bidding: Strategically bid on items to win them at the lowest possible price while maximizing the profit margin. Consider the potential risks and rewards for each item before placing your bids.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Element R:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $6000\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Assess potential profits: Calculate the potential profit for each remaining item by subtracting your estimated value from the winning bid price. Focus on items with a higher potential profit margin.\n - Anticipate the other bidder's actions: Based on the previous bids and the items remaining in the auction, try to anticipate which items the other bidder may be particularly interested in. Consider their budget and remaining funds to predict their potential bids.\n - Adjust estimation strategy: Based on the outcomes of the previous bids and the true values of the won items, refine your estimation strategy for the remaining items. Consider factors such as demand, rarity, and condition of the items to make more accurate estimations.\n - Maximize profit while minimizing competition: Aim to secure items with a good profit margin while also considering the potential competition. Look for opportunities to win items at a lower bid if the competition is likely to drive up the price.\n - Strategic allocation: Strategically allocate your remaining budget across the remaining items to ensure that you have the best chance of winning items with the highest potential profits.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Contraption I:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3500\n- Bidder 2: $3200\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
