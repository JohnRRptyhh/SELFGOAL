Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Profit Margin Analysis: Analyze the potential profit margin for each remaining item by comparing its estimated value to the previous hammer prices of similar items. Prioritize bidding on items where the potential profit margin is the highest, as this will contribute to maximizing overall profit from the remaining auctions.\n - Calculate Profit Margins: Calculate the profit margins for the items you have already won (Gadget B, Utensil N, and Mechanism J) by subtracting the winning bid from the true value. This will help you understand the accuracy of your estimations and identify any potential overestimation or underestimation.\n - Adjust Estimation Strategy: Based on the analysis of your previous wins, adjust your estimation strategy for the remaining items in the auction. Consider factors that may have led to overestimation or underestimation and apply this knowledge to make more accurate estimations for the upcoming bids.\n - Assess Profitability: Evaluate the profitability of the items you have already won and consider how it aligns with your goal of maximizing profit. This assessment will help you determine the potential impact of winning the remaining items on your overall profit.\n - Budget Constraints: Take into account your remaining budget of $3800 and ensure that your adjusted estimated values for the remaining items are within this budget. Consider the potential profit margin of each item in relation to your budget constraints.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $3800\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $11800\n  * Bidder 2: $7200\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Gadget B: $1200\n    * Utensil N: $4500\n    * Mechanism J: $5000\n    * Element R: $5500\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Appliance O: $4500\n    * Widget A: $1100\n    * Contraption I: $3200\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.
