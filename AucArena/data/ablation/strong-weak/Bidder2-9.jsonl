Allocate your $20,000 budget wisely across the 15 items, ensuring you have enough funds to bid on items with higher estimated values and potential profits.","2: Selective Bidding: Choose which items to bid on based on their potential profit margin (estimated value minus starting price) and the likelihood of winning at a price that still allows for a significant profit.","3: Bid Timing: Determine the optimal time to enter the bidding or to increase your bid, possibly waiting for other bidders to reach their maximum before you bid just enough to outbid them.","7: Opportunity Cost Consideration: Be mindful of the opportunity cost of bidding on an item, as committing funds to one item means those funds are not available for potentially more profitable items later in the auction.","8: Endgame Strategy: Plan for the later stages of the auction when competition may decrease, and there may be opportunities to acquire items at lower prices as other bidders exhaust their budgets."],["1 (Widget A)","0: Prioritize High-Value Items: Focus on items with a higher estimated value relative to their starting price, as these offer a greater potential profit margin. For example, items like Utensil N, Appliance O, Element R, Machine P, and Unit Q have high estimated values and should be prioritized.","1: Set Maximum Bids: For each item, determine a maximum bid that allows for a reasonable profit margin while considering the remaining budget. Do not exceed this maximum bid to avoid overcommitting funds.","2: Reserve Funds for Later Rounds: Anticipate that other bidders may exhaust their budgets in earlier rounds, potentially allowing you to secure items at lower prices later on. Keep enough budget in reserve to take advantage of these opportunities.","6: Be Prepared to Walk Away: If the bidding for an item exceeds your estimated value or maximum bid, be prepared to walk away. There will be other opportunities to bid on items with a better profit potential.","9: Monitor Competition: Keep an eye on the bidding patterns of other participants and step back from items with aggressive or overbidding competition."],["2 (Utensil N)","7: Set Maximum Bids: For each remaining item, determine a maximum bid that allows for a reasonable profit margin while considering the remaining budget. Do not exceed this limit to avoid depleting funds and to maintain the ability to bid on later items.","18: Prioritize High Margin Items: Focus on items with the highest potential profit margin by comparing the estimated value to the starting price and prioritizing those with the greatest difference.","22: Capitalize on Your Lead: With a profit lead and knowledge of Bidder 1's withdrawal from the second item, you may assume they are risk-averse. You can use this to your advantage by being slightly more aggressive on items you highly value, as long as it aligns with your budget and profit goals.","44: Stay Within Budget: Always keep in mind your total budget of $18,800 (after winning Widget A). Do not exceed this limit, as doing so would mean an inability to participate in future bids and a guaranteed loss of potential profit.","49: Adaptability: Be prepared to adjust your strategy in response to the flow of the auction and the actions of other bidders, maintaining flexibility in your approach."],["3 (Apparatus H)","2: Profit Tracking: Keep a running tally of your profits and budget. This will help you make informed decisions about how much to bid on remaining items to maximize overall profit.","3: Prioritize High-Value Items: Focus on items with higher estimated values and profit margins. For example, items like Appliance O, Mechanism J, Element R, Machine P, and Unit Q have high estimated values and could yield significant profits.","16: Stay Focused on Profit: The goal is to end the auction with the highest profit, not necessarily to win the most items. If the bidding goes beyond your set maximum bid, stick to your discipline and walk away.","22: Analyze Competitor Withdrawal Patterns: Notice that Bidder 1 withdrew from both items after a single bid or without bidding. This could indicate a conservative strategy or a limited budget. Use this information to predict their future behavior and potentially exploit their caution by bidding slightly above the starting price on items you value.","49: Calculate Profit Potential: For each remaining item, calculate the potential profit (estimated value minus starting price) and compare it to the potential profit of other items. Prioritize items with higher potential profits, but also consider the likelihood of winning the bid within your budget constraints."],["4 (Contraption I)","0: Consider Opportunity Costs: Bidding on one high-value item means potentially missing out on another. Weigh the expected profit of each item against the likelihood of winning it at a reasonable price.","7: Set Maximum Bids: Establish a maximum bid for each high-value item that allows for a healthy profit margin. For instance, if you estimate the value of Appliance O at $8,800 and its starting price is $4,000, you might set a maximum bid of $6,000 to ensure a profit of at least $2,800 if your estimation is accurate.","18: Diversify Your Wins: Aim to win a mix of items rather than focusing on just one or two. This spreads the risk and increases the chances of overall profit.","27: Exploit Caution: Since Bidder 1 has shown a pattern of withdrawing after a single bid or not bidding at all, you can potentially secure items by bidding just above the starting price, especially if these items are not the most highly valued ones. This could allow you to save budget for more valuable items later on.","34: Spread Your Bids: With a remaining budget of $13,800 and several items left, consider spreading your bids across multiple items rather than spending a large portion of your budget on a single item."],["5 (Appliance O)","0: Calculate Expected Profit: For each remaining item, calculate the expected profit (estimated value minus the maximum bid). Prioritize items with the highest expected profit while keeping within budget constraints.","2: Allocate Budget for Multiple Wins: With $10,300 remaining, consider spreading your budget across multiple items rather than spending it all on one or two high-value items. This diversification can increase your chances of winning more items and thus more profit.","3: Monitor Profit-to-Budget Ratio: Keep track of the ratio of profit earned to the budget spent. Aim to maintain or improve this ratio with each additional item won.","7: Prioritize High-Value Items: Focus on items with a high estimated value relative to their starting price, as these offer the potential for greater profit margins. For example, Machine P and Unit Q both have high estimated values of $11,000 with starting prices of $5,000.","8: Calculate Maximum Bids: For each remaining item, determine the maximum bid you're willing to make based on your estimated value and desired profit margin. For instance, if you want at least a $2,000 profit margin on Gizmo F (estimated value $4,400), your maximum bid would be $2,400."],["6 (Gizmo F)","0: Prioritize High Profit-to-Cost Ratio: Focus on items that offer a high profit-to-cost ratio, which means a higher return on investment. This is especially important given the limited remaining budget.","5: Prioritize Affordable Items: With a limited budget, focus on items with starting prices well within your remaining funds. This means targeting items like Gadget B and Thingamajig C, which have lower starting prices and still offer a decent estimated value.","11: Assess Remaining Budget: With only $3900 left, you cannot afford to bid on items with a starting price higher than your remaining budget. Therefore, you must focus on items with a starting price within your budget.","23: Calculate Profit Margins: For each item, calculate the potential profit margin by subtracting the starting price from your estimated value. This will give you a baseline for how high you can bid while still making a profit.","48: Reserve Budget for Later Rounds: Anticipate that other bidders may drop out or exhaust their budgets in later rounds, which could allow you to acquire items at lower prices. Keep some budget in reserve for these opportunities."],["7 (Mechanism J)","19: Avoid Overbidding: Do not bid more than the estimated value minus the starting price to maintain a profit. For example, do not bid more than $1200 for Gadget B or Thingamajig C, and do not bid more than $2400 for Equipment E.","56: Maximize Profit Within Budget Constraints: Aim to bid on the item(s) that offer the highest potential profit margin without exceeding your remaining budget. For example, if Doodad D has a starting price of $2000 and an estimated value of $4400, the potential profit margin is $2400, which is a good target given your budget.","16: Prioritize High Margin Items: With a remaining budget of $3900, focus on items that have a high potential profit margin relative to their starting price. For example, Gadget B and Thingamajig C both have a starting price of $1000 with an estimated value of $2200, offering a potential profit of $1200 each.","79: Prioritize High-Profit, Low-Cost Items: Given the budget constraints, it may be wise to focus on items with lower starting prices and high potential profits to maximize the number of items you can bid on.","81: Be Prepared to Withdraw: If the price of an item exceeds your estimated value or potential profit margin, be prepared to withdraw from bidding to conserve your budget for other items."],["8 (Gadget B)","2: Maximize Profit with Remaining Budget: Aim to win at least one or two more items within your budget that offer the highest profit margin. This will maximize your total profit with the funds you have left.","18: Stay Within Budget: Crucially, stay within the $3900 budget and avoid overbidding to prevent a loss.","21: Bid on Lower-Priced Items: Given the budget constraint, it would be strategic to bid on items with lower starting prices, such as Thingamajig C, which has a starting price of $1000 and an estimated value of $2200, offering a potential profit margin of $1200.","29: Consider Profit-to-Cost Ratio: Prioritize items with a higher profit-to-cost ratio, which indicates a better return on investment.

This is the only remaining item within your budget.","34: Assess the Situation: If the bidding for Thingamajig C goes beyond your budget, it's better to withdraw and accept the current profit you have secured rather than incur a loss.","76: Do Not Overbid: Given your limited budget, it's essential not to get caught in a bidding war that would lead you to overbid on Thingamajig C. Stick to your maximum affordable bid.","98: Target Low Starting Price Items: Target the item with the lowest starting price that you can afford and that still offers a potential profit.

Your estimated value is $2200, so if you can acquire it for $1200 or less, you will secure a profit.","40: Acceptance of Outcome: If you are outbid on Thingamajig C, accept the outcome gracefully, knowing that you have already secured a significant profit from previous wins.","83: Set a Strict Maximum Bid: Since Thingamajig C starts at $1000 and you have $1200, your maximum bid is capped at $1200. Do not exceed this amount under any circumstances to avoid completely depleting your budget.","106: Prioritize Thingamajig C: With a starting price of $1000 and an estimated value of $2200, Thingamajig C is the only remaining item you can afford with your remaining budget of $1200.

Therefore, you must secure Thingamajig C for exactly $1200 or less to stay within your budget.","40: Bid Strategy: Since you have a very tight budget constraint, you should start with the lowest possible bid and only increase in the smallest increments necessary to outbid competitors, without exceeding your budget limit.","43: Profit Preservation: Since you have already secured a total profit of $13,200, it is crucial to avoid any actions that could jeopardize this profit, such as borrowing funds or making irrational bids that exceed your budget.","89: Avoid Bidding Wars: Do not engage in a bidding war for Thingamajig C.

You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Consider Opportunity Costs: Bidding on one high-value item means potentially missing out on another. Weigh the expected profit of each item against the likelihood of winning it at a reasonable price.\n - Set Maximum Bids: Establish a maximum bid for each high-value item that allows for a healthy profit margin. For instance, if you estimate the value of Appliance O at $8,800 and its starting price is $4,000, you might set a maximum bid of $6,000 to ensure a profit of at least $2,800 if your estimation is accurate.\n - Diversify Your Wins: Aim to win a mix of items rather than focusing on just one or two. This spreads the risk and increases the chances of overall profit.\n - Exploit Caution: Since Bidder 1 has shown a pattern of withdrawing after a single bid or not bidding at all, you can potentially secure items by bidding just above the starting price, especially if these items are not the most highly valued ones. This could allow you to save budget for more valuable items later on.\n - Spread Your Bids: With a remaining budget of $13,800 and several items left, consider spreading your bids across multiple items rather than spending a large portion of your budget on a single item.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $13800\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $3800\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Widget A: $1200\n    * Utensil N: $5000\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.
