This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Prioritize the remaining items based on potential profit: Evaluate the potential profit for each remaining item by comparing their estimated value to their starting price. Prioritize the items that have the highest potential profit margin to maximize your earnings.\n - Strategically allocate your budget for upcoming bids: With a remaining budget of $16500, strategically allocate your funds for upcoming bids. Consider the starting prices of the remaining items and ensure that you have enough budget to compete for the most valuable ones.\n - Adjust estimated values based on previous outcomes: Consider the outcomes of the previous rounds and adjust your estimated values for the remaining items. For example, if you consistently overestimated the true value of items, consider adjusting your estimates downward for similar items in the future rounds.\n - Consider the competition for each item: Evaluate the level of competition for each remaining item by observing the behavior of other bidders. If certain bidders consistently drop out early or overbid, use this information to refine your estimated values and make more accurate bidding decisions.\n - Analyze Bidder 2's behavior: Review Bidder 2's actions in previous rounds to understand their bidding patterns and tendencies. Look for any consistent strategies or tendencies that can be used to anticipate their future moves.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $20000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * No winning bids\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Strategically target items with less competition: Identify items that have received less attention from other bidders and adjust your bidding strategy accordingly. This may involve targeting items that have not been bid on by Bidder 2 or have received minimal competition.\n - Budget management: Manage your remaining budget effectively to ensure that you have the necessary funds to compete for the high potential profit items while also considering the potential profits from winning those items.\n - Adjust bidding strategy based on budget: With a remaining budget of $10500, carefully consider how to allocate your funds for the remaining items. Determine which items are worth bidding on based on their estimated value and the potential for profit.\n - Maximize profit potential: Aim to maximize your profit potential by winning items at a bid as minimal as possible compared to their true value. Consider the potential resale value of the items and aim to secure them at a price that allows for a significant profit margin.\n - Prioritize high-value items: Focus on bidding for items with higher estimated values, such as Machine P, Apparatus H, Element R, Utensil N, Unit Q, and Appliance O, as winning these items will potentially yield higher profits.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Apparatus H:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3500\n- Bidder 2: $3200\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Assess the potential profit margin for the remaining items: Evaluate the potential profit margin for the remaining items (Appliance O and Gadget B) based on your estimated value and the starting price. Prioritize the item with the highest potential profit margin for bidding.\n - Adapt to the current profits: Assess the current profits of both you and the other bidder. Consider the potential impact of winning an item on your overall profit compared to the other bidder.\n - Strategic bidding: Given your limited budget, strategically bid on Gadget B to maximize your potential profit margin while ensuring that you do not exhaust your remaining budget on an item with a lower profit potential.\n - Evaluate the estimated value of the remaining item: Assess the estimated value of the remaining item (Gadget B) in comparison to your remaining budget. Determine if the potential profit margin aligns with your goal of maximizing profit.\n - Identify potential competition: Determine if there are other bidders who have consistently competed with you in previous rounds and assess their remaining budget and profit. This can help in understanding potential competition for the remaining item.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $2500\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $12500\n  * Bidder 2: $13700\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Contraption I: $3500\n    * Machine P: $6000\n    * Apparatus H: $3500\n    * Utensil N: $4500\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Doodad D: $2500\n    * Implement G: $3200\n    * Element R: $5500\n    * Unit Q: $6000\n    * Widget A: $1100\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.
