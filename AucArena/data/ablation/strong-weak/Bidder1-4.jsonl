Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Prioritize higher estimated value items: Allocate a larger portion of your remaining budget towards bidding on items with higher estimated values, such as Utensil N, Appliance O, Machine P, Mechanism J, and Unit Q. These items have the potential to yield greater profit margins.\n - Flexibility in budget allocation: Be prepared to adjust your budget allocation based on the bidding dynamics and competition for each item. This may involve reallocating funds from lower priority items to higher priority items if necessary.\n - Minimize risk: Avoid overspending on items with lower estimated values, as this can lead to minimal or negative profit margins. It's important to strategically allocate your budget to minimize potential losses while maximizing potential profits.\n - Strategic bidding: Strategically bid on each item, considering the starting price, your estimated value, and potential competition from other bidders to win items at the lowest possible bid, maximizing your profit margin.\n - Secure high-value items: Prioritize winning items with higher estimated values, as they have the potential to yield greater profit margins by being assertive in your bidding for these items.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Equipment E:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $2500\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
