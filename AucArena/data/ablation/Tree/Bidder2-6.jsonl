Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Stay ethical: While leveraging psychological insights, ensure that your bidding tactics remain ethical and respectful, avoiding manipulation or coercion in your interactions with other bidders.\n - Balance assertiveness and flexibility: Find the right balance between assertiveness in pursuing your goals and the flexibility to adapt to the changing dynamics of the auction without compromising your overall objectives.\n - Establishing trust: Develop the ability to convey trustworthiness and reliability to other bidders, potentially leading to more cooperative interactions.\n - Communication and coordination: If working as part of a team or with a partner, ensure clear communication and coordination to facilitate flexible resource allocation based on the evolving auction dynamics.\n - Identifying serious competitors: Identify the most active and determined bidders in the auction. This can help in focusing efforts on understanding and potentially outmaneuvering the most significant competition.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Gizmo F:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Gizmo F, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Gizmo F. \nAs Bidder 2, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.
