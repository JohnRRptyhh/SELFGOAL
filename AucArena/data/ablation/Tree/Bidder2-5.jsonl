Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Analyzing bidding patterns: Study the historical bidding data to identify patterns and trends that can inform strategic decisions during the auction.\n - Stay ethical: While leveraging psychological insights, ensure that your bidding tactics remain ethical and respectful, avoiding manipulation or coercion in your interactions with other bidders.\n - Brief guidelines: {\"Determine the item's value\": 'Assess the value of the item based on its condition, market demand, and potential resale value.', 'Establish bidding limits': \"Set clear limits on how much you are willing to bid, considering your budget and the item's perceived value.\", 'Stay informed': 'Stay updated on any changes in the auction dynamics, such as new bidders entering or significant bids being placed.', 'Be adaptable': 'Remain flexible in your approach and be prepared to adjust your bidding strategy based on the evolving auction dynamics.', 'Maintain composure': 'Keep a calm and composed demeanor throughout the auction to make rational decisions and avoid impulsive bidding.'}\n - Adapting to changes: Be prepared to adapt resource allocation based on changes in bidding patterns. For example, if a key competitor suddenly increases their bids, it may be necessary to adjust the budget or bidding strategy accordingly.\n - Negotiation strategies: Develop strategies for negotiating with the seller or other bidders in case the bidding process becomes unfavorable, such as convincing the seller to lower the reserve price or persuading other bidders to drop out.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Unit Q:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $6000\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
