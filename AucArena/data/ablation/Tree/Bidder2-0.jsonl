No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}. If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Based on the bidding history, it seems that both Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 withdrew from bidding on Implement G in the last round. As a result, the auctioneer moved on to the next item.\n\nHere's the updated status:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 800,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 14500,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 14800\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Utensil N\": 4200,\n      \"Widget A\": 1100,\n      \"Apparatus H\": 4000,\n      \"Contraption I\": 3200,\n      \"Equipment E\": 2500,\n      \"Mechanism J\": 4500\n    },\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\n      \"Gadget B\": 1200,\n      \"Appliance O\": 4500,\n      \"Unit Q\": 5500,\n      \"Machine P\": 5500,\n      \"Gizmo F\": 2500\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
