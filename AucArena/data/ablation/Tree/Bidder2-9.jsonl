This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Be flexible: Remain open to alternative proposals and be willing to adjust your own position to accommodate the needs of other bidders, while still aiming to secure a favorable outcome for yourself.\n - Identifying missed opportunities: Recognize instances where potential opportunities for securing a higher profit were overlooked or where resources could have been managed more effectively.\n - Establishing trust: Develop the ability to convey trustworthiness and reliability to other bidders, potentially leading to more cooperative interactions.\n - Initial engagement: Begin the auction with a friendly and approachable demeanor, initiating polite and respectful interactions with other bidders.\n - Adapt your approach: Tailor your bidding strategy based on your understanding of the psychological factors at play, adjusting your tactics to influence the behavior of other bidders and maximize your chances of securing the item at a favorable price.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Appliance O:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Appliance O, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Appliance O. \nAs Bidder 2, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.
