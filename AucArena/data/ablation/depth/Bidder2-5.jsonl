However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Risk assessment: Evaluate the potential competition for each item and consider the risk of overbidding. Allocate funds strategically to balance the potential for profit with the risk of losing out on items.\n - Assess competition: Evaluate the bidding behavior of other bidders in previous rounds to identify items where there is less competition. Look for patterns where other bidders withdrew early or where there were fewer bidders competing for an item.\n - Monitor total profits: Keep track of the total profits of other bidders to gauge their remaining budget and potential bidding power in the upcoming rounds. This information can help inform your bidding strategy and maximize profit opportunities.\n - Adaptability: As the auction progresses, be prepared to adapt your budget allocation and bidding strategy based on the behavior of other bidders and the outcomes of previous rounds.\n - Prioritize high-value items: Allocate a larger portion of the remaining budget towards items with higher estimated values, such as Unit Q, Machine P, Contraption I, Mechanism J, Element R, and Implement G, to maximize potential profits.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $18700\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $700\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Gadget B: $1300\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Risk management: Be mindful of the potential risk of overbidding and the impact on your remaining budget. Avoid overextending your resources on lower-value items that may not yield significant profits.\n - Factor in previous profits: Consider the profits you have already secured from winning previous items and how they may impact your bidding strategy for the remaining items.\n - Assess competition: Evaluate the bidding behavior of other bidders in previous rounds to identify items where there is less competition. Look for patterns where other bidders withdrew early or where there were fewer bidders competing for an item.\n - Evaluate the profitability of remaining items: Assess the estimated value of the remaining items and compare it to your remaining budget. Identify the items that have the potential to yield the highest profit margin based on your estimated value and available budget.\n - Maximize profit: Ultimately, the sub-goal is to secure the highest profit at the end of the auction by winning items at the lowest possible bid and maximizing the difference between the true value and your winning bid. Keep this overarching goal in mind as you adjust your bidding strategy based on the true values of the remaining items.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Equipment E:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $2200\n- Bidder 3: $2500\n- Bidder 4: $2100\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Avoid overextending your resources on lower-value items that may not yield significant profits.\n - Factor in previous profits: Consider the profits you have already secured from winning previous items and how they may impact your bidding strategy for the remaining items.\n - Assess competition: Evaluate the bidding behavior of other bidders in previous rounds to identify items where there is less competition. Look for patterns where other bidders withdrew early or where there were fewer bidders competing for an item.\n - Evaluate the profitability of remaining items: Assess the estimated value of the remaining items and compare it to your remaining budget. Identify the items that have the potential to yield the highest profit margin based on your estimated value and available budget.\n - Maximize profit: Ultimately, the sub-goal is to secure the highest profit at the end of the auction by winning items at the lowest possible bid and maximizing the difference between the true value and your winning bid.

This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Risk management: Be mindful of the potential risk of overbidding and the impact on your remaining budget. Avoid overextending your resources on lower-value items that may not yield significant profits.\n - Factor in previous profits: Consider the profits you have already secured from winning previous items and how they may impact your bidding strategy for the remaining items.\n - Assess competition: Evaluate the bidding behavior of other bidders in previous rounds to identify items where there is less competition. Look for patterns where other bidders withdrew early or where there were fewer bidders competing for an item.\n - Evaluate the profitability of remaining items: Assess the estimated value of the remaining items and compare it to your remaining budget. Identify the items that have the potential to yield the highest profit margin based on your estimated value and available budget.\n - Adaptability: As the auction progresses, continue to adapt your bidding strategy based on the behavior of other participants and new information to maximize your chances of winning high-value items at the lowest possible bid.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Implement G:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3500\n- Bidder 2: $3500\n- Bidder 3: $4000\n- Bidder 4: $3500\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
