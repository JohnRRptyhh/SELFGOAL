Consider the potential profit margin for each item and bid accordingly.\n - Prioritize high-value items: Focus on bidding for items with higher estimated values, such as Unit Q, Mechanism J, Element R, and Utensil N, as they have the potential to yield higher profits.\n - Consider the true value of the items: Take into account the true value of the items, as revealed in the auction log, to make informed decisions about the maximum bid you are willing to place for each item.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Unit Q:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $6000\n- Bidder 3: $5500\n- Bidder 4: $5200\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Monitor remaining budget: As the auction progresses, keep a close eye on your remaining budget. Ensure that you allocate your budget effectively to secure items with the highest potential profit while also factoring in potential bidding wars with Bidder 1.\n - Assess the risk tolerance of other bidders: Evaluate the risk tolerance of other bidders by observing their willingness to continue bidding as the price increases. This can provide insights into their budget management and profit-maximization strategies.\n - Calculate potential profit margins: Calculate the potential profit margins for each remaining item by comparing their true values to your estimated values. Focus on bidding on items where the potential profit margin is higher.\n - Flexibility in budget allocation: Remain flexible in your budget allocation strategy to adapt to the bidding behavior of other participants and unexpected changes in the auction dynamics.\n - Assess competition: Evaluate the competition from other bidders and adjust your bidding strategy accordingly to secure high-value items while minimizing the winning bid.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Mechanism J:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $4200\n- Bidder 2: $4500\n- Bidder 3: $4500\n- Bidder 4: $4200\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Mechanism J, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Mechanism J. \nAs Bidder 2, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.
