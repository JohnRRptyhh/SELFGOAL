However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Adapt bidding strategy: Adapt your bidding strategy based on the insights gained from the previous rounds. This may involve being more aggressive in pursuing high-value items or conserving budget for items with lower estimated values.\n - Assess Profit Margins: Evaluate the potential profit margins for the remaining items and prioritize those with the highest resale potential. This can help you focus your efforts on securing items that will contribute significantly to your overall profit.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Equipment E:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $2200\n- Bidder 3: $2500\n- Bidder 4: $2100\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Adapt bidding strategy: Adapt your bidding strategy based on the insights gained from the previous rounds. This may involve being more aggressive in pursuing high-value items or conserving budget for items with lower estimated values.\n - Assess Profit Margins: Evaluate the potential profit margins for the remaining items and prioritize those with the highest resale potential.
