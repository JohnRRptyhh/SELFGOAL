This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Strategic bidding: Develop a strategic bidding approach for high-value items, considering the estimated values and starting prices. Be prepared to adjust your bidding strategy based on the actions of other bidders.\n - Budget Reallocation: Consider reallocating your budget for the remaining items based on their estimated values and the potential risks involved. Allocate more budget to items with higher estimated values while ensuring that you have enough funds to bid on multiple items.\n - Risk Mitigation Strategy: Develop a risk mitigation strategy to minimize potential losses from overestimation or underestimation of item values. This may involve setting a maximum bid limit for each item based on its estimated value and the current bidding environment.\n - Profit Maximization: While mitigating risks, continue to focus on maximizing profit by strategically bidding on items with the highest potential returns relative to their estimated values.\n - Risk assessment: Continuously assess the potential risks and rewards of each bidding decision, considering the potential impact on your overall profit and the competition from other bidders. Make informed decisions to maximize the flexibility in bidding and adapt to the evolving auction dynamics.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $20000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * No winning bids\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.
