However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Prioritize high estimated value items: Allocate a larger portion of the remaining budget to bid on items with higher estimated values, such as Unit Q, Mechanism J, Element R, and Utensil N. These items have the potential to yield higher profits based on your estimations.\n - Strategic bidding on mid-range items: For items like Equipment E, Gizmo F, Doodad D, Implement G, and Apparatus H, consider strategic bidding to ensure that you don't overpay but still have a chance to win these items if the bidding remains within your budget.\n - Monitor competition: Keep an eye on the bidding behavior of other bidders, especially for items with higher estimated values. Adjust your bidding strategy based on the actions of other participants to maximize the chances of winning at a reasonable price.\n - Prioritize high-profit items: Identify the remaining items with the highest potential profits based on your estimated values. Focus on items with a significant difference between your estimated value and the starting price, as these offer the highest potential returns.\n - Identify potential bidding wars: Identify items with high estimated values that may attract multiple bidders, leading to bidding wars. Prepare a strategic approach for these items, considering the potential competition and the maximum bid you are willing to place.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Gizmo F:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $2500\n- Bidder 2: $2500\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $2500\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Gizmo F, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Gizmo F. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.

However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Prioritize higher estimated value items: Allocate a larger portion of the remaining budget towards bidding on items with higher estimated values, such as Element R and Utensil N, as these items have the potential to yield higher profits based on your estimations.\n - Risk management: Evaluate the potential risks and rewards of bidding on each remaining item. Consider the likelihood of winning the item at a price that allows for a significant profit based on your estimations, and weigh this against the risk of overbidding and reducing the overall profitability of the auction.\n - Assess the deviation: Evaluate the deviation between your estimated value and the true value for the remaining items. Items with a higher potential deviation may pose a greater risk, so consider this when deciding which items to bid on.\n - Strategic bidding: Bid strategically on items with a lower potential deviation between your estimated value and the true value. This will help minimize the risk of overbidding and maximize potential profits.\n - Budget allocation: Allocate your remaining budget wisely, considering the potential risks and rewards of each item. Avoid overspending on items with high potential deviation and focus on maximizing profits with calculated bids.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $15100\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $2800\n  * Bidder 4: $3100\n  * Bidder 2: $5300\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Appliance O: $4900\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Equipment E: $2700\n    * Unit Q: $6000\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Evaluate Bidder 2's strategy: Analyze Bidder 2's bidding behavior in previous rounds to understand their approach. Look for patterns in their bidding, such as aggressive bidding on high-value items or strategic withdrawals on certain items.\n - Identify potential competition: Identify the remaining items with higher estimated values (Implement G, Apparatus H, Element R, Utensil N) and anticipate potential competition from Bidder 2, who has a higher total profit than you. Consider the likelihood of Bidder 2 targeting these items based on their previous bids and profits.\n - Strategic allocation of remaining budget: Strategically allocate your remaining budget of $15100 across the remaining items, prioritizing those with higher estimated values. Consider the potential competition from Bidder 2 and be prepared to adjust your bidding strategy accordingly.\n - Calculate potential profit margins: Calculate the potential profit margins for each of the remaining items based on your estimated value and the current bidding trends. This will help you prioritize which items to focus on and how much to bid.\n - Observant: Pay close attention to the behavior and actions of other bidders in the upcoming rounds, as their decisions will impact your bidding strategy. Stay observant and ready to adjust your approach accordingly.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Apparatus H:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3500\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3: $3200\n- Bidder 4: $3200\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
