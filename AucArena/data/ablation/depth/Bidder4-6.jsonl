Consider the bidding behavior of other bidders in previous rounds to anticipate their strategies.\n - Maximize profit margins: Aim to win high-value items at the lowest possible bid to maximize your profit margins.\n - Strategic bidding: Develop a strategic bidding approach that allows for winning items at the lowest possible price, while also considering the potential competition from other bidders. This may involve observing the behavior of other bidders and adjusting bidding strategies accordingly.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Gadget B:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Gadget B, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Gadget B. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.
