Aim to win items at the lowest possible bid to maximize your profit margin.\n - Budget management: Ensure that you have sufficient funds reserved for bidding on the high-value items, while also considering the potential resale value in the broader market.\n - Competitive Bidding: Adjust your bidding strategy based on the behavior of Bidder 3 and the estimated values of the remaining items, aiming to outbid them when necessary to secure high-profit items.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Doodad D:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $2500\n- Bidder 2: $2200\n- Bidder 3: $2500\n- Bidder 4: $2500\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Doodad D, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Doodad D. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.
