Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1.

However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Continuously monitor the bidding behavior of other participants: Be prepared to adjust estimated values in real-time based on the unfolding bidding dynamics.\n - Prioritize remaining items based on estimated value: Focus on items with higher estimated values to maximize potential profit. Prioritize the remaining items based on their estimated value and potential profit margin.\n - Consider potential resale value and demand in the broader market: Consider the potential resale value of each item and its demand in the broader market to make informed decisions about bidding.\n - Stay vigilant and adapt to the changing dynamics of the auction: The behavior of other bidders and the true values of the remaining items may continue to influence the reassessment of estimated values.\n - Consider the remaining budget of $14000 and the total profits earned so far to determine the maximum amount to bid on each remaining item: Determine the maximum amount to bid on each remaining item by considering the remaining budget of $14000 and the total profits earned so far, ensuring enough budget is left for potential high-value items.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $14000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 2: $4200\n  * Bidder 3: $4000\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Gadget B: $1300\n    * Machine P: $6500\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * Unit Q: $6000\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Stay disciplined in your bidding approach and avoid getting caught up in bidding wars: With a remaining budget of $14000, it's important to allocate funds strategically to maximize profit across the remaining items.\n - Consider the competition from other bidders and strategize to secure the remaining items at a price that allows for a significant profit margin.: Take into account the competition from other bidders and develop a strategy to secure the remaining items at a price that ensures a substantial profit margin.\n - Be prepared to withdraw from bidding if the price exceeds the estimated value and the potential profit margin becomes too narrow.: Be ready to withdraw from bidding if the price surpasses the estimated value and the potential profit margin becomes too narrow.\n - Consider the potential resale value of the remaining items: This will impact the overall profit from winning the items.\n - Maximize potential profit: Aim to secure at least one or more of the high-value items within the remaining budget to increase the chances of achieving a higher overall profit by the end of the auction.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Implement G:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3500\n- Bidder 2: $3500\n- Bidder 3: $4000\n- Bidder 4: $3500\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
