This may involve being more conservative in bidding on items with lower estimated values to ensure sufficient funds for the more lucrative items.\n - Assess the competition: Analyze the bidding behavior of other bidders, especially for items with higher estimated values such as Unit Q, Machine P, and Appliance O. Look for patterns in their bidding strategies and assess their willingness to bid aggressively.\n - Stay informed: Continuously monitor the bidding activity and outcomes of other bidders to stay informed about the level of competition and adjust your approach accordingly.\n - Flexibility in Budget Allocation: Remain flexible in budget allocation, as the behavior of other bidders and the dynamics of the auction may change.

Consider adjusting your estimated values to align more closely with the market value, reducing the risk of overestimation or underestimation.\n - Prioritize high-profit items: Focus on targeting items with higher estimated values and potential profits, such as Machine P and Appliance O, to maximize the overall profit potential.\n - Assess the competition: Analyze the behavior of the remaining bidders to identify patterns or tendencies in their bidding strategies.

If Bidder 3's strategy proves effective, it may be beneficial to align your estimated values more closely with the true values of the items.\n - Prioritize items with differing estimated values: Focus on bidding for items where your estimated value significantly differs from Bidder 3's winning items.
