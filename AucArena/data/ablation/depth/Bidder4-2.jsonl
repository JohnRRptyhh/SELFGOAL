However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Risk assessment: Evaluate the potential profit margins and risks associated with each item. Prioritize items with a higher potential for profit while considering the likelihood of winning the bid at a reasonable price.\n - Budget allocation: Allocate your remaining budget of $15000 strategically across the remaining items, ensuring that you have enough funds to compete for high-value items while also considering the starting prices of the items.\n - Adjust estimated values: Reassess your estimated values for the remaining items based on the auction dynamics and adjust them if necessary to make more accurate bidding decisions.\n - Assess the competition for each item: Evaluate the behavior of other bidders and their willingness to bid on specific items. This will help in determining the level of competition for each item and the potential risk associated with bidding.\n - Stay flexible and adaptable: Be prepared to adapt your bidding strategy based on the actions of other bidders and the specific dynamics of each item. This may involve adjusting your bids, strategically withdrawing from certain items, or making calculated decisions based on the behavior of other bidders.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Doodad D:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Doodad D, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Doodad D. \nAs Bidder 4, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.

Consider the likelihood of facing strong competition for each item and weigh this against the potential profit margin. It may be beneficial to focus on items where competition is less intense.\n - Adapt bidding strategy: Based on the above considerations, adapt your bidding strategy to prioritize items with the highest potential profit margin while taking into account the remaining budget and competition from other bidders. This will help you make informed decisions to maximize your profit in the remaining rounds of the auction.\n - Prioritize higher estimated value items: With a limited budget remaining, prioritize bidding on items with higher estimated values to maximize potential profit margins. This means focusing on Appliance O with an estimated value of $8800.\n - Calculate potential profit margins: Assess the potential profit margins for the remaining items by comparing their estimated values to the current budget.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Evaluate the true value: Consider the true value of the remaining item, Gadget B, and compare it to your estimated value. If the potential profit margin is significant, consider allocating a portion of your remaining budget to bid on this item.\n - Analyze the behavior of other bidders: Review the bidding behavior of other bidders in previous rounds to understand their strategies and tendencies. This can help anticipate their actions in upcoming rounds and adjust your bidding approach accordingly.\n - Consider potential competition for the remaining item: Evaluate the likelihood of facing strong competition for the remaining item, Gadget B. If other bidders have shown a pattern of aggressive bidding for similar items, it may indicate intense competition for this item.\n - Weigh competition against potential profit margin: Compare the potential profit margin of Gadget B with the level of competition it may attract. If the estimated value of Gadget B aligns with your profit goals and the competition for this item is relatively low, it may be a strategic opportunity to focus on winning this item.\n - Adapt bidding strategy based on competition: Adjust your bidding strategy for Gadget B based on the assessment of competition.
