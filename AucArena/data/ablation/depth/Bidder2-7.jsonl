Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Strategic budget allocation: With $20,000 remaining, carefully allocate your budget for the remaining items, considering the estimated values and potential competition from other bidders.\n - Stay flexible: Be prepared to adapt and adjust your estimated values based on the dynamics of the auction, ensuring that you are making informed decisions to secure the highest profit possible.\n - Assess competition behavior: Evaluate the behavior of other bidders in terms of their willingness to compete for specific items. This can help in prioritizing which items to focus on and when to strategically outbid them.\n - Risk assessment: Evaluate the potential profit margins for each item and weigh them against the risk of overbidding. Consider the potential resale value and the likelihood of winning the item at a reasonable bid.\n - Prioritize high-value items: Focus on winning items with higher estimated values to maximize potential profit margins.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $20000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $5800\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Utensil N: $4900\n    * Contraption I: $4100\n    * Thingamajig C: $1200\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * No winning bids\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

This indicates that none of the bidders were willing to pay a high price for Gadget B.\n\nHere's the updated status:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 20000,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 9300,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 0\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Utensil N\": 4900,\n      \"Contraption I\": 4100,\n      \"Thingamajig C\": 1200,\n      \"Unit Q\": 6500\n    },\n    \"Bidder 2\": {}\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
