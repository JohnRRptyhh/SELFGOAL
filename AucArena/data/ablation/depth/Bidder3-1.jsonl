You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Be strategic in bidding: Consider the bidding patterns of other bidders and adjust your strategy to increase the chances of winning items with higher estimated values at a reasonable price.\n - Monitor your budget: Keep track of your remaining budget and ensure that you allocate it efficiently to maximize potential profit from winning higher estimated value items.\n - Consider previous profits: Take into account the profits made by the remaining bidders so far. Bidders with higher profits may be more aggressive in their bidding, while those with lower profits may be more conservative.\n - Plan bidding strategy: Develop a strategic approach for each remaining item, considering the behavior and budget of the remaining bidders. Determine the maximum bid for each item based on the competition and potential profitability.\n - Calculate potential profit: Calculate the potential profit for each remaining item by subtracting your estimated value from the true value, and consider the profit margin in relation to the starting price and your remaining budget.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $16500\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 2: $3500\n  * Bidder 3: $2500\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Machine P: $6500\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * Apparatus H: $3500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.
