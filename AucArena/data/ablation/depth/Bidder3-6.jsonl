The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Prioritize high-value items: Focus on the remaining items with a high estimated value relative to their starting price, such as Machine P, Appliance O, and Unit Q. These items have the potential for high resale value and should be prioritized in your bidding strategy.\n - Maximize profit diversity: Aim to diversify your winning bids to maximize potential profit. Consider targeting items that complement the ones you have already won, allowing you to build a diverse set of items with high resale potential.\n - Competitive Bidding: Be prepared to engage in competitive bidding for high-value items, especially those with a significant difference between your estimated value and the true value. This may involve carefully monitoring the bidding activity of other bidders and strategically entering the bidding war at the right time.\n - Track successful bids: Take note of the items that each bidder has successfully won and compare them to their estimated values. This can provide insights into their bidding strategies and their ability to accurately assess item values.\n - Evaluate the competition for remaining items: Analyze the level of competition for the remaining items in the auction. Consider the number of active bidders and their bidding tendencies for each item. This assessment will help you determine which items are likely to be highly contested and which ones may have less competition.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $17500\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $8500\n  * Bidder 2: $1000\n  * Bidder 3: $1500\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Utensil N: $4500\n    * Implement G: $3200\n    * Contraption I: $3800\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Mechanism J: $7000\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * Doodad D: $2500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Based on the bidding history, all bidders placed the same initial bid for Apparatus H, and then all withdrew in the next round, resulting in no winning bid for the item.\n\nHere's the updated status:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 17500,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 8500,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 1000,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 1500\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Utensil N\": 4500,\n      \"Implement G\": 3200,\n      \"Contraption I\": 3800\n    },\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\n      \"Mechanism J\": 7000\n    },\n    \"Bidder 3\": {\n      \"Doodad D\": 2500\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
