Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Prioritize high-value items: Focus on researching the resale value of items with higher estimated values, such as Unit Q, Machine P, Element R, and Apparatus H, as winning these items could potentially yield higher profits.\n - Consider profit margins: Analyze the difference between the estimated value and the starting price for each item, and prioritize researching items with the highest potential profit margins.\n - Stay informed: Continuously monitor the auction and adjust your bidding strategy based on the insights gained from researching the resale value of similar items.\n - Be prepared to act: Use the research to make informed decisions during the bidding process, aiming to win items at a price that maximizes potential profit based on their resale value.\n - Be cautious of overestimating the true value of items: This could lead to overbidding and reduced profit margins.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $20000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * No winning bids\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Prioritize high-value items: Focus on researching the resale value of items with higher estimated values, such as Unit Q, Machine P, Element R, and Apparatus H, as winning these items could potentially yield higher profits.\n - Consider profit margins: Analyze the difference between the estimated value and the starting price for each item, and prioritize researching items with the highest potential profit margins.\n - Stay informed: Continuously monitor the auction and adjust your bidding strategy based on the insights gained from researching the resale value of similar items.\n - Be prepared to act: Use the research to make informed decisions during the bidding process, aiming to win items at a price that maximizes potential profit based on their resale value.\n - Be cautious of overestimating the true value of items: This could lead to overbidding and reduced profit margins.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Widget A:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $1100\n- Bidder 2: $1200\n- Bidder 3: $1100\n- Bidder 4: $1100\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
