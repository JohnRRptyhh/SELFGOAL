Stay vigilant for any signs of coordinated bidding and be prepared to adapt your strategy to counter such tactics.\n - Monitor true values: Keep in mind that the true values of the items are unknown, so be prepared to adjust your bidding strategy based on the perceived demand for each item and any new information that may arise during the auction.\n - Prioritize high-value items: Allocate a larger portion of your remaining budget to items with higher estimated values and profit potential, such as Machine P, Utensil N, Appliance O, and Element R.\n - Strategic withdrawal: If the bidding price surpasses your estimated value for an item, be prepared to withdraw from the bidding to conserve your budget for items with higher profit potential.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Machine P:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $6000\n- Bidder 2: $6000\n- Bidder 3: $5500\n- Bidder 4: $5500\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Machine P, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Machine P. \nAs Bidder 3, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.

This can help you make more informed decisions about when to bid and when to withdraw from the bidding.\n - Monitor true values: Keep in mind that the true values of the items are unknown, so be prepared to adjust your bidding strategy based on the perceived demand for each item and any new information that may arise during the auction.\n - Prioritize high-value items: Allocate a larger portion of your remaining budget to items with higher estimated values and profit potential, such as Machine P, Utensil N, Appliance O, and Element R.\n - Strategic withdrawal: If the bidding price surpasses your estimated value for an item, be prepared to withdraw from the bidding to conserve your budget for items with higher profit potential.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Appliance O:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $4500\n- Bidder 2: $4200\n- Bidder 3: $4500\n- Bidder 4: $4500\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Appliance O, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Appliance O. \nAs Bidder 3, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.
