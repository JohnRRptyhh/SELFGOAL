If Bidder 2 continues to exhibit a high risk tolerance, use this information to inform your bidding decisions in subsequent rounds.\n - Analyze the potential profit margin for Bidder 2 based on the difference between the winning bid prices and their estimated values: Assess the potential profit margin for Bidder 2 by considering the variance between the winning bid prices and their estimated values.\n - Maximize profit: Keep the ultimate goal of maximizing profit in mind. While staying competitive with Bidder 2 and other bidders is important, the primary objective is to secure items at the lowest possible bid while still generating significant profits. Keep this goal at the forefront of your decision-making process.\n - Prioritize high-value items: Focus on allocating a significant portion of your budget towards high-value items such as Unit Q, Machine P, Element R, and Utensil N, as these items have the potential to yield higher profits based on your estimated values.\n - Maximize profit potential: Aim to secure the high-value items at a price that allows for a substantial difference between the item's true value and your winning bid, ultimately maximizing your profit at the end of the auction.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Contraption I:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\n- Bidder 4: $3200\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
