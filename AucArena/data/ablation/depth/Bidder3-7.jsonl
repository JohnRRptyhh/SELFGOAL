Consider the estimated value of each item and prioritize bidding on high-value items that align with your estimated value.\n - Strategic bidding: Develop a strategic bidding approach for the remaining items, considering the potential risk and reward for each item. Determine the maximum bid you are willing to place on items with a high estimated value but a low starting price, taking into account the potential profit margin.\n - Profit maximization: Focus on securing items with a high estimated value relative to their starting price, aiming to win these items at a minimal bid to maximize the profit margin.\n - Adjust estimated values: Reassess your estimated values for the remaining items based on the bidding behavior in the previous rounds.

Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Consider the true value of won items: Take into account the true value of the items that were won by other bidders. If the winning bids significantly deviated from your estimated values, adjust your estimations for the remaining items accordingly.\n - Evaluate your budget and remaining items: Assess your current budget and the estimated values of the remaining items. Determine if there are any items for which you may need to adjust your estimated value to ensure you have enough funds to bid on high-value items later in the auction.\n - Monitor the behavior of other bidders in real-time: Continuously monitor the bidding activity of other participants during the auction to adapt your strategy based on their actions and the overall dynamics of the auction.\n - Prioritize items with higher true values: Given the behavior of other bidders, prioritize the remaining items with higher true values. This may involve allocating a larger portion of your budget to items with higher potential profits, such as Apparatus H, Unit Q, and Appliance O.\n - Analyze the total profits of other bidders: Review the total profits of each bidder to understand their success in previous bids and their financial capacity for future bids. Bidder 1 has a total profit of $5800, indicating a successful track record in winning items at a reasonable price.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $20000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $5800\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Utensil N: $4900\n    * Contraption I: $4100\n    * Thingamajig C: $1200\n  * Bidder 3:\n    * No winning bids\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value.

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Maximize profit opportunities: Focus on maximizing your profit by winning items at bids that align with the adjusted estimations and offer a significant profit margin. Prioritize items with potential for high resale value and aim to secure them at competitive bids.\n - Evaluate your budget and remaining items: Assess your current budget and the estimated values of the remaining items. Determine if there are any items for which you may need to adjust your estimated value to ensure you have enough funds to bid on high-value items later in the auction.\n - Prioritize items with higher true values: Given the behavior of other bidders, prioritize the remaining items with higher true values. This may involve allocating a larger portion of your budget to items with higher potential profits, such as Apparatus H, Unit Q, and Appliance O.\n - Estimate their willingness to bid higher: Consider the willingness of other bidders to increase their bids based on their total profits. Bidder 1's profits suggest a willingness to bid higher on items with a higher true value, as they have successfully secured items at prices close to their estimated values.\n - Calculate Potential Profit Margins: Calculate the potential profit margins for each remaining item by comparing the starting price, your estimated value, and the behavior of other bidders. Prioritize items with a high potential profit margin.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Appliance O:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $4500\n- Bidder 3: $4500\n- Bidder 4: $5000\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\n- Bidder 3 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

No equation is needed, just the numerical value.\n- 'winning_bids': The winning bids for every item won by each bidder, listed as key-value pairs, for example, {\"bidder_name\": {\"item_name_1\": winning_bid}, {\"item_name_2\": winning_bid}, ...}. If a bidder hasn't won any item, then the value for this bidder should be an empty dictionary {}.\n- Only include the bidders mentioned in the given text. If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"In this round of bidding, Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 both withdrew from the bidding war for Gadget B, leaving Bidder 3 as the only remaining bidder. However, since no one bid on Gadget B, the auctioneer moved on to the next item.\n\nHere's the updated status:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 20000,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 9300,\n    \"Bidder 3\": 0\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Utensil N\": 4900,\n      \"Contraption I\": 4100,\n      \"Thingamajig C\": 1200,\n      \"Unit Q\": 6500\n    },\n    \"Bidder 3\": {}\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
