Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Prioritize higher estimated value items: Allocate a larger portion of your budget to bid on items with higher estimated values, such as Machine P, Unit Q, Mechanism J, Element R, and Utensil N, to potentially secure higher profits.\n - Consider competition: Take into account the bidding behavior of other bidders and adjust your budget allocation to compete effectively for items with high estimated values, while also being mindful of potential bidding wars that could impact your budget.\n - Risk assessment: Continuously reassess the potential risks and rewards of allocating your budget to different items, considering the potential profit margins and the likelihood of winning each item at a favorable price.\n - Budget allocation: Reassess your budget allocation for the remaining items, considering the winning bid for Appliance O and the potential competition from other bidders. Ensure that you have enough budget reserved for items with higher estimated values.\n - Flexibility in bidding strategy: Be prepared to adapt your bidding strategy based on the outcomes of previous bids and the behavior of other bidders. Flexibility will help minimize potential losses from underestimation or missed opportunities.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $20000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n  * Bidder 3: $0\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 4:\n    * Appliance O: $4900\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.
