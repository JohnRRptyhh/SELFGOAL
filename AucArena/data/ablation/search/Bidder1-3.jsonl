This involves analyzing similar items' selling prices, market demand, and potential future value trends to determine the maximum bid that ensures a profitable resale.\n - Calculating the financial investment: Determine the total amount of money that could potentially be lost if the auction is unsuccessful. This includes the initial bid amount, any additional costs such as taxes or fees, and the potential resale value of the item if it is not acquired.\n - Assessing opportunity cost: Evaluate the potential opportunities that could be missed if the auction is lost. Consider the time, resources, and energy invested in the auction that could have been allocated to other profitable endeavors.\n - Developing contingency plans: Create contingency plans to mitigate potential losses in the event of an unsuccessful auction.

Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Identify comparable items: Identify items that are similar in nature, condition, and rarity to the item being auctioned to establish a basis for comparison.\n - Identifying key competitors: Identify the most active and competitive bidders and develop specific strategies to counter their actions.\n - Calculating maximum bid threshold: Determine the maximum bid threshold based on the item's value, potential profit, and the behavior of other bidders.\n - Assessing financial limits: Evaluate the financial resources available and determine the maximum amount that can be allocated to the auction without impacting other financial obligations or business operations.\n - Flexibility in approach: Be prepared to adapt the bidding strategy and resource allocation based on the changing dynamics of the auction, such as unexpected increases in bidding or changes in the perceived value of the item.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Gizmo F:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $2500\n- Bidder 2: $2500\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Gizmo F, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Gizmo F. \nAs Bidder 1, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.
