This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Identify comparable items: Identify items that are similar in nature, condition, and rarity to the item being auctioned to establish a basis for comparison.\n - Analyze recent sale prices: Research recent sales of comparable items to understand their market value and determine a benchmark for the item being auctioned.\n - Identifying key competitors: Identify the most active and competitive bidders and develop specific strategies to counter their actions.\n - Flexibility in bidding strategy: Be prepared to adjust the maximum bid based on real-time information and changes in the auction dynamics, such as increased competition or shifts in perceived value.\n - Assessing opportunity cost: Evaluate the potential opportunities that could be missed if the auction is lost. Consider the time, resources, and energy invested in the auction that could have been allocated to other profitable endeavors.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Implement G:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2: $3500\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
