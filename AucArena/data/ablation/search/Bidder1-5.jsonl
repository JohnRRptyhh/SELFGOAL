This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Assessing the item's value: Conduct thorough research to understand the true value of the item being auctioned. Consider factors such as the item's condition, rarity, and market demand to determine its potential resale value and set a maximum bid that aligns with the goal of maximizing profit.\n - Considering potential resale value: Evaluate the potential resale value of the item if acquired through the auction. This involves analyzing similar items' selling prices, market demand, and potential future value trends to determine the maximum bid that ensures a profitable resale.\n - Calculating the financial investment: Determine the total amount of money that could potentially be lost if the auction is unsuccessful. This includes the initial bid amount, any additional costs such as taxes or fees, and the potential resale value of the item if it is not acquired.\n - Calculating maximum bid threshold: Determine the maximum bid threshold based on the item's value, potential profit, and the behavior of other bidders.\n - Observing bidding patterns: Pay close attention to the behavior of other bidders, including the frequency and timing of their bids. This can provide insights into their strategies, limits, and level of interest in the item.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Doodad D:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Doodad D, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Doodad D. \nAs Bidder 1, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.

You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Calculating maximum bid threshold: Determine the maximum bid threshold based on the item's value, potential profit, and the behavior of other bidders.\n - Identifying key competitors: Identify the most active and competitive bidders in the auction. Understanding their strategies and limits can help in making informed decisions about resource allocation.\n - Prioritizing high-value items: Allocate resources towards bidding on items that have the potential to yield the highest profit, based on their estimated value and market demand.\n - Monitoring resource utilization: Keep track of the resources allocated to each bid and assess their impact on potential profitability, adjusting the allocation as necessary to maintain efficiency.\n - Market analysis: Gain a deep understanding of the market for the item being auctioned, including current demand, pricing trends, and potential competitors.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Utensil N:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $4500\n- Bidder 2: $4000\n\nRound 1:\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Identify comparable items: Identify items that are similar in nature, condition, and rarity to the item being auctioned to establish a basis for comparison.\n - Analyze recent sale prices: Research recent sales of comparable items to understand their market value and determine a benchmark for the item being auctioned.\n - Consider variations: Take into account any variations in the item, such as different editions, sizes, or historical significance, and how these variations may impact its value.\n - Identifying key competitors: Identify the most active and competitive bidders and develop specific strategies to counter their actions.\n - Calculating maximum bid threshold: Determine the maximum bid threshold based on the item's value, potential profit, and the behavior of other bidders.\n - Anticipating counter-bids: Anticipate potential counter-bids from competitors and develop response strategies to maintain the upper hand.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Mechanism J:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $4500\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Identify comparable items: Identify items that are similar in nature, condition, and rarity to the item being auctioned to establish a basis for comparison.\n - Analyze recent sale prices: Research recent sales of comparable items to understand their market value and determine a benchmark for the item being auctioned.\n - Consider variations: Take into account any variations in the item, such as different editions, sizes, or historical significance, and how these variations may impact its value.\n - Identifying key competitors: Identify the most active and competitive bidders and develop specific strategies to counter their actions.\n - Calculating maximum bid threshold: Determine the maximum bid threshold based on the item's value, potential profit, and the behavior of other bidders.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Contraption I:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1: $3200\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Sold!
