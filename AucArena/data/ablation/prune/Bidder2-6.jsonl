However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Evaluate potential profit margins: Analyze the potential profit margins for the remaining items based on their true value and your estimated value. Prioritize items with higher potential profit margins, but also consider the level of competition for those items.\n - Seek expert opinions: If possible, seek expert opinions or consult with individuals knowledgeable about the market for the types of items being auctioned. Their insights can provide valuable information to inform your bidding decisions and potentially increase your profit margins.\n - Research market trends: Continuously monitor the market trends and demand for the remaining items in the auction. This will help in making informed decisions about which items are likely to yield higher profits.\n - Adjust budget allocation: If the starting prices for certain items are higher than expected or if there is intense competition, be ready to adjust your budget allocation for subsequent items. This may involve reallocating funds from lower-priority items to ensure that you can compete effectively for high-profit items.\n - Maximize Profit Margin: Ultimately, aim to secure items with the highest potential for profit while ensuring that your winning bids align with your estimated values, thus maximizing your overall profit margin at the end of the auction.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $10500\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $6500\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n    * Gizmo F: $2500\n    * Doodad D: $2500\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Consider the likelihood of winning: Assess the likelihood of winning each item at a favorable price based on the behavior of other bidders and the remaining budget. Avoid overcommitting to items with intense competition unless the potential profit justifies the risk.\n - Prioritize high-profit potential: Focus on items with a higher estimated value compared to their starting price. This will maximize your potential profit margin if you win the item.\n - Consider niche appeal: Look for items that have niche appeal or unique features, as these are more likely to have a higher resale value. Items with unique or specialized functions may justify a higher bidding price.\n - Assess Niche Appeal: Evaluate the niche appeal and potential resale value of the remaining items (Machine P, Unit Q, and Utensil N) based on your estimated values. Focus on items that have the potential for high resale value, even if they have a higher starting price.\n - Consider the starting prices: Look for items with starting prices that may not attract significant competition based on the behavior of other bidders. Items with lower starting prices may be less attractive to other bidders, presenting an opportunity for you to secure them at a lower bid.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $4400\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $11300\n  * Bidder 2: $10400\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * Contraption I: $3500\n    * Equipment E: $2500\n    * Implement G: $3200\n    * Element R: $5500\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Mechanism J: $4500\n    * Gizmo F: $2500\n    * Doodad D: $2500\n    * Appliance O: $5000\n    * Gadget B: $1100\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.
