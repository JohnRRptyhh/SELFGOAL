However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Adjust estimated values for remaining items: Use the analysis of previous profits to adjust your estimated values for the remaining items more accurately. Consider any tendencies or biases in your estimations and make necessary adjustments to improve the accuracy of your future bidding decisions.\n - Reassess estimated values: Given the outcomes of the previous rounds, reassess the estimated values of the remaining items based on the bidding patterns and true values of the items that have already been auctioned. Adjust the estimated values to reflect any emerging market dynamics or changes in bidding patterns.\n - Calculate potential profitability: Calculate the potential profitability of each remaining item by comparing their estimated values with the starting prices. This will help you prioritize items with higher potential profit margins.\n - Budget allocation: Reassess your budget allocation for the remaining items, ensuring that you have enough funds to bid on items with higher estimated values and potential profitability.\n - Monitor the auction: Continuously monitor the auction dynamics and adjust your prioritization strategy based on the bidding patterns of other bidders and the outcomes of previous rounds.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"Here is the history of the bidding war of Contraption I:\n\"Round 0:\n- Bidder 1 withdrew\n- Bidder 2 withdrew\"\n\nThe auctioneer concludes: \"Since no one bid on Contraption I, we'll move on to the next item.\" \n\n---\n\nYou lost Contraption I. \nAs Bidder 1, you have to update the status of the auction based on this round of bidding.
