Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Consider the uniqueness of each item: Evaluate the uniqueness and desirability of each remaining item in comparison to Gadget B. This can help in adjusting your estimated values to reflect the potential bidding behavior of other participants.\n - Factor in the remaining budget and total profits: Take into account your remaining budget of $20,000 and the total profits of other bidders. Adjust your estimated values to ensure that you can strategically bid on the remaining items while aiming to maximize your profit.\n - Adjust estimated values based on Bidder 2's actions: Take into account Bidder 2's winning bid for Gadget B and their remaining budget to adjust your estimated values for the remaining items. If Bidder 2 has a higher budget and has already won an item, they may be more aggressive in their bidding, which could affect the final price of the remaining items.\n - Maximize profit while minimizing risk: Aim to secure items at a price that maximizes your profit while considering the potential impact of Bidder 2's bidding behavior. Avoid overbidding on items where Bidder 2's influence may significantly drive up the price.\n - Prioritize high estimated value items: Focus on the items with a higher estimated value, such as Utensil N, Mechanism J, Unit Q, Machine P, and Appliance O, as they have the potential for a larger profit margin.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $20000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $800\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * Gadget B: $1200\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.

If a bidder is not mentioned (e.g. Bidder 4 in the following example), then do not include it in the JSON object.\n\nAfter summarizing the bidding history, you must output the current status in a parsible JSON format. An example output looks like:\n```\n{\"remaining_budget\": 8000, \"total_profits\": {\"Bidder 1\": 1300, \"Bidder 2\": 1800, \"Bidder 3\": 0}, \"winning_bids\": {\"Bidder 1\": {\"Item 2\": 1200, \"Item 3\": 1000}, \"Bidder 2\": {\"Item 1\": 2000}, \"Bidder 3\": {}}}\n```"}],"result":"Based on the bidding history, Bidder 2 won Appliance O at a price of $5000, which is lower than the true value of $8000. Bidder 1 withdrew from the bidding war for Appliance O.\n\nHere's the updated status:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"remaining_budget\": 2100,\n  \"total_profits\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": 14100,\n    \"Bidder 2\": 10900\n  },\n  \"winning_bids\": {\n    \"Bidder 1\": {\n      \"Implement G\": 3200,\n      \"Mechanism J\": 4200,\n      \"Machine P\": 5500,\n      \"Doodad D\": 2500,\n      \"Gizmo F\": 2500\n    },\n    \"Bidder 2\": {\n      \"Gadget B\": 1200,\n      \"Utensil N\": 4900,\n      \"Equipment E\": 2500,\n      \"Thingamajig C\": 1500,\n      \"Appliance O\": 5000\n    }\n  }\n}\n```","tag":"summarize_14"}]}
