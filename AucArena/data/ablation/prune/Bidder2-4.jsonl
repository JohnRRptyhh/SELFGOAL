Consider whether adjustments are needed to ensure you have sufficient funds to compete for the remaining high-value items while avoiding overspending on lower-value items.\n - Prioritize items with less competition: Identify items that have received less attention from other bidders and prioritize them in your bidding strategy. This can increase your chances of winning items at lower bids and maximizing your profit margin.\n - Assess item desirability: Evaluate the desirability of the remaining items based on their functionality, rarity, or potential resale value. This assessment can influence the adjustment of estimated values to better reflect the market demand for each item.\n - Prioritize high-profit margin items: With a remaining budget of $9500, prioritize items with the potential for higher profits to maximize your remaining budget.
