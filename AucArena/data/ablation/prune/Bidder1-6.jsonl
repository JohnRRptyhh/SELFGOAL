This auction will have some other bidders to compete with you in bidding wars. The price is gradually raised, bidders drop out until finally only one bidder remains, and that bidder wins the item at this final price. Remember: Your primary objective is to secure the highest profit at the end of this auction, compared to all other bidders.\n\nHere are some must-know rules for this auction:\n\n1. Item Values: The true value of an item means its resale value in the broader market, which you don't know. You will have a personal estimation of the item value. However, note that your estimated value could deviate from the true value, due to your potential overestimation or underestimation of this item.\n2. Winning Bid: The highest bid wins the item. Your profit from winning an item is determined by the difference between the item's true value and your winning bid. You should try to win an item at a bid as minimal as possible to save your budget.\nHere are some possible subgoals and guidance derived from your primary objective: \n - Prioritize high-value items: Focus on winning items with higher estimated values, such as Mechanism J, Appliance O, Element R, Machine P, Unit Q, and Utensil N, as these items have the potential to yield higher profits.\n - Competitive analysis: Monitor the behavior of other bidders and adapt your bidding strategy based on their actions. Consider the bidding patterns of other bidders and adjust your strategy to increase the likelihood of winning items at the lowest possible bid.\n - Profit optimization: Aim to secure wins for items with a significant difference between your estimated value and the true value, as this will maximize your profit. Be prepared to withdraw from bidding if the price exceeds the potential profit.\n - Budget allocation: With the remaining budget in mind, strategically allocate funds for bidding on the remaining items. Prioritize items with higher estimated values while ensuring that enough budget is reserved for potential bidding wars.\n - Strategic bidding: Strategically bid on each item, considering the starting price, estimated value, and potential competition from other bidders. Know when to drop out of the bidding to avoid overpaying for an item.\n\nIn this round, You may target some of these subgoals and guidance to improve your bidding strategy and action, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n"},{"human":"The current status of you and other bidders is as follows:\n```\n* Remaining Budget: $20000\n\n* Total Profits:\n  * Bidder 1: $0\n  * Bidder 2: $0\n\n* Winning Bids:\n  * Bidder 1:\n    * No winning bids\n  * Bidder 2:\n    * No winning bids\n```\n\nHere are the remaining items in the rest of the auction:\n\"1.
