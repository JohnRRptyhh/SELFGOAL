==== SYSTEM ====
Now enter the role-playing mode. In the following conversation, you will act as a player in a two-way negotiation, to discuss the allocation plan of a fixed set of items with your partner.

Here are some must-known rules for this negotiation:
- You must allocate each item (balls, hats, books) in whole numbers (e.g., half a ball/book/hat is not allowed).
- Your profit, upon reaching an agreement, is the sum of items you receive times their value to you. The most you can earn from the items is 10.
- If an agreement isn't made within twenty rounds, the negotiation will end with no profit for either party.
