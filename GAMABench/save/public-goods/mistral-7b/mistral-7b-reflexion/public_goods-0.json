      "learnings": "Reflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that all players contributed tokens to the public pot in Round 1, and the total contributions resulted in a public good payoff of 29 tokens. The payoff was then evenly distributed among all players, resulting in a gain of 6.6 tokens for me and an updated token balance of 21.6.\n\nOne possible reason for the outcome in Round 1 could be that all players, including myself, may have underestimated the potential benefits of contributing a larger share of their tokens to the public pot. By doing so, we could have potentially received a higher individual payoff due to the multiplication factor of 2 applied to the public pot.\n\nTo mitigate this potential failure in future rounds, I will adopt a new, high-level plan. I will aim to contribute a larger share of my tokens to the public pot in each round, while still ensuring that I retain a sufficient number of tokens for my own use. This strategy may result in a higher individual payoff, as well as potentially benefiting the other players by contributing to a larger public good payoff.\n\nAdditionally, I will reflect on the game results and my own contributions after each round to assess the effectiveness of this new strategy and make any necessary adjustments based on the evolving game dynamics.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log provided, it appears that in both rounds, I contributed more tokens to the public pot than the average contribution of the other players. While this strategy may result in a larger public good payoff and subsequent gain for all players, it also leaves me with fewer tokens in my private collection compared to my opponents.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, I will adopt a new strategy of contributing tokens closer to the average of the other players' contributions in each round. This approach should allow me to maintain a more balanced collection of tokens while still contributing to the public good and receiving a fair share of the payoff.\n\nAdditionally, I will reflect on the game results after each round to assess the effectiveness of this strategy and make adjustments as necessary. This self-reflection and adaptability will enable me to optimize my token contributions and improve my overall performance in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or optimal strategy emerging for contributing tokens in this game. Each player seems to be making independent decisions without considering the potential impact on their overall token balance or the total tokens contributed to the public pot. This could lead to suboptimal outcomes for all players, as the public good payoff and subsequent individual gains may not be maximized.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve the overall game performance, a new, high-level plan could be to encourage collaboration and communication among players. This could involve sharing information about individual token balances and potential strategies for contributing tokens to the public pot. By working together, players may be able to identify optimal strategies that maximize the public good payoff and individual gains. Additionally, setting a target for the total tokens to be contributed to the public pot in each round could help ensure that all players are aligned towards a common goal and making informed decisions based on the group's collective interests.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have not been optimally strategic in the given context of the game. The tokens contributed by each player in each round have varied significantly, leading to inconsistent public pot sizes and, consequently, unequal gains for all players. This inconsistency may have resulted in suboptimal token collections for me in some rounds.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my strategy, I will aim to analyze the contributions of other players and adjust my token contribution accordingly. Specifically, I will attempt to contribute a proportionate amount of tokens to the public pot based on the average contribution of all players in the previous rounds. This approach should help ensure a more consistent public pot size and, consequently, more equal gains for all players, including myself.\n\nAdditionally, I will keep track of the total tokens contributed by each player and the total tokens in the public pot to better understand the relationship between my contribution and the overall game dynamics. This information will help me make more informed decisions in future rounds and potentially lead to better overall performance in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or optimal strategy for contributing tokens that maximizes individual gain in this game. The variability in the number of tokens contributed by each player and the resulting public pot size leads to inconsistent gains for each player.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my strategy, I will aim to analyze the contributions of other players and adjust my own accordingly. Specifically, I will monitor the average number of tokens contributed by each player and try to contribute slightly more or less than that average in each round. This approach may help me to avoid contributing too many tokens and losing out on potential gains from larger public pots, while also avoiding contributing too few tokens and missing out on the equal share of the public good payoff.\n\nAdditionally, I will consider the possibility of collaborating with other players to coordinate contributions and potentially maximize overall gains for the group. This could involve communicating with other players to share information about past contributions and potential strategies, or even forming alliances to coordinate contributions in a more deliberate way. However, I will need to carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of such collaboration, as well as the potential for free riding or exploitation by other players.\n\nOverall, my new plan is to closely monitor the contributions of other players and adjust my own strategy accordingly, while also considering the potential benefits and risks of collaboration to maximize my gains in this game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or optimal strategy for contributing tokens that maximizes individual gain in this game. Each player seems to be contributing different amounts of tokens in each round, leading to varying gains. One possible reason for this inconsistency could be the lack of communication or coordination among players, resulting in sub-optimal contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve the overall strategy, a new plan could be to establish a communication channel among players to discuss and coordinate their token contributions in each round. This could be done through a private messaging system or a shared document where players can propose and discuss potential strategies before making their contributions. By collaborating and sharing information, players can work together to optimize their contributions and potentially increase their individual gains while also contributing to the public good. Additionally, players could explore the possibility of using mathematical models or game theory to inform their decision-making process and make more informed contributions based on the current state of the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or optimal strategy for contributing tokens that maximizes individual gain. The players seem to contribute varying amounts of tokens in each round, leading to inconsistent public pot sizes and individual gains.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my strategy, I will analyze the contributions of other players and adjust my own contributions accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to contribute a percentage of my total tokens that is slightly above the average contribution of the other players in each round. This approach should help ensure that the public pot is large enough to generate a significant gain for all players, while also allowing me to retain a reasonable number of tokens for myself.\n\nAdditionally, I will keep track of the total tokens contributed by each player and the resulting public pot sizes and individual gains. This data will help me identify any trends or patterns in the game and adjust my strategy accordingly. By staying flexible and responsive to the actions of other players, I hope to improve my performance in the game and increase my overall gain.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or optimal strategy for contributing tokens that maximizes individual gain in this public goods game. The players' contributions vary widely from round to round, and there seems to be no correlation between the number of tokens contributed and the resulting payoff for each player.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my strategy, I will analyze the data more closely to identify any trends or patterns that may exist. I will also consider the possibility of adopting a tit-for-tat strategy, where I contribute a consistent number of tokens each round, while also taking into account the contributions of other players. This approach may encourage cooperation and help ensure a more stable and predictable payoff for all players, including myself.\n\nAdditionally, I will consider communicating with the other players to discuss potential strategies and coordinate our contributions to maximize the overall public good and individual gains. By working together and sharing information, we may be able to optimize our contributions and improve the overall outcome of the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be no clear pattern or strategy in my token contributions that would maximize my gains in this public goods game. I have contributed varying numbers of tokens in each round, neither consistently maximizing nor minimizing my contributions. This inconsistency may have resulted in suboptimal gains.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a new, high-level plan: I will aim to contribute a constant percentage of my tokens to the public pot in each round. This strategy will allow me to maintain a consistent contribution while still allowing for flexibility in my token holdings. By analyzing the total number of tokens I have after each round and calculating the percentage I wish to contribute, I can make informed decisions that will help me optimize my gains over the course of the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be no clear pattern or optimal strategy for contributing tokens that maximizes individual gain. This is likely due to the fact that the optimal contribution depends on the contributions of the other players, making it a non-cooperative game with elements of uncertainty and risk.\n\nTo mitigate this uncertainty and potentially improve individual gains, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a mixed strategy approach. This would involve contributing a range of tokens in each round, rather than a fixed amount. By analyzing the historical data and the contributions of other players, the agent could adjust its contribution accordingly to maximize its expected gain. This approach would require keeping track of the other players' past contributions and using statistical analysis to inform the decision-making process. Additionally, the agent could consider collaborating with other players to coordinate contributions and potentially increase the overall public pot, leading to higher individual gains for all players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern in the number of tokens contributed by each player, including myself, in each round. This lack of consistency in contributions may be leading to unpredictable payoffs for all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my strategy, I will aim to analyze the contributions of other players and adjust my own accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to contribute a similar number of tokens as the average contribution of the other players in each round. This approach should help ensure a more stable and predictable payoff for all players, including myself.\n\nAdditionally, I will reflect on the potential impact of my contributions on the overall public good and consider contributing more tokens when I believe it will lead to a larger payoff for all players. This approach should help promote cooperation and coordination among players, leading to better outcomes for everyone involved.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a discrepancy between the number of tokens you contributed and the number recorded by the game master. This inconsistency may have occurred due to a miscommunication or recording error. To mitigate this issue and ensure accurate tracking of contributions, a new plan could be implemented where each player confirms their contribution before the game master records it. Additionally, the game master could provide a clearer and more detailed explanation of the contribution process to prevent any confusion. This will help maintain transparency and trust among the players, ensuring a smoother game experience.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or optimal strategy for contributing tokens that maximizes individual gain. The contributions of each player vary widely, and there seems to be no correlation between the number of tokens contributed and the resulting gain. This inconsistency may be due to the randomness of the public pot multiplier and the fact that each player's gain is determined by the total tokens in the pot, not their individual contribution.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my strategy, I will analyze the historical data to identify trends and patterns, if any, in the contributions of other players. I will also consider the potential impact of different contribution levels on the overall pot size and my expected gain. Additionally, I will explore the possibility of collaborating with other players to coordinate contributions and potentially maximize the overall pot size and individual gains.\n\nA new, concise, high-level plan would be to gather data on the contributions of other players, analyze the trends and potential impact on the pot size and individual gains, and consider collaborating with other players to optimize contributions for mutual benefit. This approach may involve communication and coordination with other players to establish a strategy that balances individual gain with the overall pot size and encourages cooperation and collaboration.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a pattern where player_0 contributes a consistent number of tokens (10) in most rounds, regardless of the total tokens contributed by other players or the potential gain from contributing more. This strategy may not be optimal as it does not take into account the potential benefits of contributing more tokens to the public pot in certain rounds, which could result in higher individual gains.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new, high-level plan for player_0 could be to adopt a more flexible contribution strategy. This could involve analyzing the total tokens contributed by all players in each round and adjusting player_0's contribution accordingly to maximize individual gain. For instance, if the total tokens contributed by all players are low, player_0 could consider contributing a larger share to increase the public pot and potentially gain more from the resulting payoff. Conversely, if the total tokens contributed are already high, player_0 could contribute fewer tokens to retain more for themselves. By adopting a more flexible contribution strategy, player_0 may be able to optimize their gains in each round and improve overall performance in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is a inconsistency in my token contribution strategy. In some rounds, I contributed fewer tokens than others, resulting in lower gains and a smaller token balance compared to some of the other players. This inconsistency may have been due to a lack of a clear strategy or insufficient analysis of the optimal token contribution in each round.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will develop a more strategic approach to token contribution. I will analyze the current token balance and the expected contribution of the other players to determine the optimal token contribution for each round. This will involve considering the potential payoff from contributing more tokens to the public pot versus retaining them for personal gain. By implementing this strategy consistently, I aim to maximize my overall gain and maintain a competitive token balance with the other players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or consistent strategy in my token contributions that would maximize my gains in each round. In some rounds, contributing fewer tokens resulted in lower gains, while in other rounds, contributing more tokens did not lead to significantly higher gains.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a more strategic approach by analyzing the contributions of other players and adjusting my own contributions accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to contribute a percentage of my tokens that is slightly above the average contribution of the other players in each round. This approach should help me to ensure that I am contributing enough tokens to the public pot to maximize the overall payoff, while also retaining enough tokens for myself to maintain a healthy balance.\n\nAdditionally, I will keep track of the total tokens in the public pot and the total gains of each round to identify any trends or patterns that may emerge over time. This information will help me to refine my strategy and make more informed decisions in future rounds.\n\nOverall, my new plan is to contribute a percentage of my tokens that is slightly above the average contribution of the other players in each round, while also keeping track of the total tokens in the public pot and the total gains of each round to identify trends and patterns that can inform my strategy.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or optimal strategy for contributing tokens that maximizes individual gain. The contributions of each player vary widely, and there is no consistent correlation between the number of tokens contributed and the resulting gain. This inconsistency may be due to the randomness of the public pot multiplier and the fact that each player's gain is determined by the total tokens in the pot, not just their own contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my performance in the game, I will adopt a more flexible and adaptive strategy. Instead of contributing a fixed number of tokens every round, I will analyze the contributions of the other players and adjust my own accordingly. For example, if I notice that other players are consistently contributing a large number of tokens, I may choose to contribute fewer tokens in order to maintain a more balanced distribution and potentially increase my overall gain. Conversely, if I see that other players are contributing fewer tokens, I may choose to contribute more in order to increase the size of the public pot and potentially earn a larger share of the resulting payoff. By adapting my strategy to the actions of the other players, I hope to improve my performance and increase my overall gain in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is a inconsistency in my strategy as I have contributed the same number of tokens, 10, in several rounds despite the potential for higher gains by adjusting my contribution based on the number of tokens contributed by other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may have resulted in missed opportunities to maximize my tokens after each round.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will develop a new strategy that involves analyzing the contributions of other players and adjusting my own contribution accordingly to maximize my tokens after each round. This approach will allow me to respond dynamically to the actions of other players and potentially secure a higher token balance over the course of the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or optimal strategy for contributing tokens that maximizes individual gain. The players seem to contribute varying amounts of tokens in each round, and there is no consistent relationship between the amount contributed and the resulting gain.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my performance in the game, I will adopt a more strategic approach by analyzing the contributions of other players and adjusting my own accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to contribute a proportionally larger share of tokens when other players contribute less, in order to increase my potential gain from the public good payoff. Conversely, when other players contribute a larger share, I will contribute a smaller amount to minimize my loss. This strategy, known as \"tit-for-tat,\" has been shown to be effective in repeated prisoner's dilemma games and may also apply to this public goods game scenario. By adopting this strategy, I aim to increase my overall gain and improve my performance in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or consistent strategy in my token contributions that would maximize my gains in this game. In some rounds, contributing fewer tokens resulted in lower gains, while in other rounds, contributing more tokens did not lead to significantly higher gains.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a more strategic approach by analyzing the contributions of other players and adjusting my own accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to contribute a percentage of the total tokens that is slightly above the average contribution of the other players, while ensuring that I do not contribute all of my tokens in any given round. This approach should allow me to maintain a reasonable balance between contributing to the public good and retaining tokens for myself, while also encouraging other players to contribute more as well.\n\nAdditionally, I will keep track of the total tokens in the public pot and the gains from each round to identify any trends or patterns that may emerge over time. This information will help me make more informed decisions about my token contributions in future rounds and improve my overall strategy.\n",

      "learnings": "Reflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that in Round 1, I contributed fewer tokens (3) than some of my opponents, which may have resulted in a lower payoff for me compared to them. This could have been a suboptimal decision, as contributing more tokens would have led to a larger share of the public good payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to analyze the contributions of my opponents in each round and adjust my strategy accordingly. Specifically, I will strive to contribute a proportionally larger share of my tokens to the public pot when my opponents contribute a smaller share, in order to increase my potential payoff. This approach should help me to better balance my contributions and potentially improve my overall game performance.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that in both rounds, I contributed fewer tokens than the average contribution of the other players. This may have resulted in a lower payoff for me compared to the other players, as the public good payoff is evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to contribute a larger number of tokens in future rounds, closer to the average contribution of the other players. This will increase my chances of receiving a larger payoff from the public good, while still retaining some tokens for my private collection.\n\nA more specific plan could be to analyze the average contribution of the other players in each round and aim to contribute a similar or slightly larger number of tokens. This will require careful observation and adaptability, as the average contribution may vary from round to round. Additionally, I will consider the potential long-term benefits of contributing more tokens, such as building trust and cooperation with the other players, which may lead to better outcomes in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that in each round, I contributed tokens that were lower than some of the other players, resulting in a smaller gain for myself compared to the other players. This strategy may not be optimal as it results in a smaller share of the public good payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to contribute a larger number of tokens in each round, while still considering the potential gains and losses based on the contributions of other players. This strategy may result in a larger share of the public good payoff and a more balanced distribution of tokens among all players.\n\nA high level plan to implement this strategy could be as follows:\n\n1. Analyze the contributions of other players in each round to estimate the potential size of the public pot.\n2. Determine an optimal contribution level based on the estimated pot size and potential gains and losses.\n3. Contribute the determined number of tokens to the public pot in each round.\n4. Monitor the contributions of other players and adjust the strategy as needed to maintain a competitive position in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions in the previous rounds have not been optimally strategic. In some rounds, I contributed fewer tokens than other players, resulting in lower gains for myself. In other rounds, I contributed more tokens than optimal, which while increasing the public good, also reduced my own tokens for future rounds.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to analyze the contributions of other players and adjust my own accordingly. I will strive to contribute a proportionate amount to the public pot based on the average contribution of all players in each round. This approach will ensure that I contribute enough to maximize the public good while also retaining a sufficient number of tokens for my own benefit.\n\nAdditionally, I will keep track of the total tokens in the game and adjust my strategy accordingly if I notice a significant deviation from the average contribution of all players. This will help me maintain a balance between contributing to the public good and retaining tokens for my own gain.\n\nIn summary, my new plan is to contribute a proportionate amount to the public pot based on the average contribution of all players in each round, while keeping track of the total tokens in the game and adjusting my strategy accordingly. This approach will help me maximize both the public good and my own gain in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have not been optimally strategic in the given context of the game. The discrepancy in my performance could be due to a lack of consideration for the total tokens contributed by all players in each round and the resulting public pot size. A more effective strategy would be to analyze the contributions of other players and adjust my own accordingly to maximize my potential gain.\n\nA new, concise, high level plan to mitigate this failure would be to:\n1. Monitor the contributions of other players in each round.\n2. Calculate the potential public pot size based on the total contributions.\n3. Determine the optimal number of tokens to contribute to maximize my gain.\n4. Adjust my strategy as needed based on the actions of other players and the changing game dynamics.\n\nBy implementing this plan, I aim to make more informed decisions about my token contributions and improve my overall performance in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that in most rounds, you contributed the same number of tokens as some of the other players, resulting in a public pot that was often close to the maximum possible value. This strategy, while not necessarily a failure in terms of gaining tokens for yourself in the short term, may not be optimal for long-term success in the game.\n\nA possible reason for this behavior could be a lack of consideration for the potential impact of individual contributions on the overall public good and the resulting payoff for all players. To mitigate this failure, a new, high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach to token contribution, aiming to find a balance between contributing enough to maximize the public good and retaining enough tokens for personal gain. This could involve analyzing the contributions of other players and adjusting your own accordingly to encourage a more diverse range of contributions and potentially larger public pots, leading to greater overall gains for all players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a pattern where you are contributing fewer tokens than some of the other players in most rounds. This could potentially lead to a lower payoff for you in the long run, as the public good payoff is evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new, high-level plan could be to carefully consider the optimal number of tokens to contribute in each round based on the total contributions of all players and the potential payoff. One strategy could be to contribute a proportionally larger share of tokens when other players contribute fewer tokens, in order to maximize the potential for a higher payoff. Conversely, when other players contribute a larger share, it may be more beneficial to contribute fewer tokens to retain a larger private collection. This approach requires careful observation of the other players' contributions and adaptability in response.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a discrepancy between the number of tokens each player reported contributing and the actual tokens in the public pot. This could potentially be due to a recording error or a strategic misrepresentation of contributions by some players.\n\nTo mitigate this potential issue and ensure fairness in the game, a new plan could be to implement a system where each player reveals their contribution before the tokens are added to the public pot. This way, all players can see each other's contributions and there is transparency in the process. Additionally, the game master can double-check the recorded contributions against the revealed contributions to ensure accuracy. This approach should help build trust among the players and reduce the potential for discrepancies or misunderstandings.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a pattern where the player is contributing tokens consistently, but the gains are not increasing at a significant rate compared to the other players. This could be due to the fact that the player is contributing tokens that are close to the average of the total tokens contributed by all players in each round.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new, high-level plan would be for the player to analyze the average tokens contributed by all players in each round and aim to contribute a slightly higher amount to increase the player's share of the public pot and subsequent gains. This strategy would involve careful observation of the other players' contributions and adjusting the player's own contributions accordingly to maximize the potential for greater gains.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a pattern where I contributed fewer tokens in some rounds compared to my co-players, resulting in lower gains for me in those rounds. This strategy may not have been optimal as it led to a lower overall token count for me compared to my peers.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to contribute a consistent number of tokens in each round, based on an analysis of the average tokens contributed by the group and the potential gains from the public pot. This approach should help me maintain a more competitive token count and potentially lead to higher overall gains in the long run. Additionally, I will reflect on the reasons for contributing fewer tokens in certain rounds and consider adjusting my strategy accordingly to ensure that I am making the most informed decision possible in each round.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is a inconsistency in my token contribution strategy. In some rounds, I contributed fewer tokens than in others, despite the fact that contributing more tokens in each round would have resulted in a higher personal gain in the long run, due to the multiplication of the public pot and the equal distribution of the payoff among all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a new, high level plan that aims to contribute a consistent number of tokens in each round, based on the average number of tokens that the other players contribute. This strategy, which I will call the \"average contribution strategy,\" will involve calculating the average number of tokens contributed by all players in the previous rounds and adjusting my contribution accordingly. By following this strategy, I aim to ensure that I contribute a similar amount of tokens as the other players, while still maintaining some flexibility to deviate from the average if I believe it would be beneficial to do so based on the current game state.\n\nAdditionally, I will reflect on the game log after each round to assess the effectiveness of this strategy and make any necessary adjustments. For example, if I notice that my contributions are consistently lower than the average, I may consider increasing my contribution in future rounds to catch up with the other players. Conversely, if I notice that my contributions are consistently higher than the average, I may consider reducing my contribution to avoid overcommitting my tokens and risking a lower personal gain.\n\nOverall, by adopting the average contribution strategy and reflecting on its effectiveness after each round, I aim to improve my token contribution strategy and maximize my personal gain in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is a discrepancy between the number of tokens you contributed and the number reported by the game master. This inconsistency may have occurred due to a recording error or a misunderstanding of the instructions. To mitigate this issue and ensure accurate record-keeping, I propose the following high-level plan:\n\n1. Double-check the contribution numbers reported by the game master against your personal records before the start of each round.\n2. Clearly communicate your contribution to the game master before the round begins, either verbally or in writing, to minimize the chance of miscommunication.\n3. Request that the game master confirm your contribution before moving on to the next round to ensure that both parties have the same understanding of the contribution.\n4. Maintain a personal record of your contributions throughout the game to facilitate comparison with the game master's records.\n\nBy implementing this plan, we can minimize the likelihood of recording errors and misunderstandings, ensuring a more accurate and efficient game experience for all players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my strategy of contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot each round, without considering the contributions of other players, has not been effective in maximizing my tokens after each round. This approach has resulted in varying gains and tokens remaining after each round.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a more dynamic strategy by observing the contributions of other players and adjusting my own accordingly. This could involve contributing fewer tokens when other players contribute more, and more tokens when they contribute fewer. By taking a more responsive approach, I aim to optimize my gains and maintain a more consistent token balance throughout the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a inconsistency in my token contribution strategy. In some rounds, I contributed fewer tokens than in others, despite the fact that contributing more tokens in each round could potentially lead to higher overall gains due to the multiplication of the public pot and the equal distribution of the payoff among all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a new, high level plan that aims to contribute a consistent number of tokens in each round, with the goal of maximizing my overall gains. Specifically, I will aim to contribute a percentage of my total tokens to the public pot in each round, rather than making arbitrary decisions based on the contributions of other players. This approach should help me to maintain a more stable and effective token contribution strategy, and potentially lead to higher overall gains over the course of the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is a discrepancy in my strategy as I have contributed inconsistent numbers of tokens in various rounds. This inconsistency may have negatively impacted my overall token balance and potentially affected my ability to maximize my gains in the game.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new, high-level plan that aims to contribute a consistent number of tokens in each round. This strategy will involve analyzing the average number of tokens contributed by other players and adjusting my contribution accordingly to ensure that I am contributing a proportionate share while also maintaining a sufficient number of tokens for my own gain. By implementing this consistent contribution strategy, I aim to improve my token balance and maximize my overall gains in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or optimal strategy for contributing tokens that maximizes individual gain. The contributions of each player vary widely, and there is no consistent correlation between the number of tokens contributed and the resulting gain. This suggests that a random or haphazard approach to token contribution may not be effective in this game.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my performance, I will analyze the data more closely to identify any trends or patterns that may exist, such as the relationship between the number of tokens contributed and the size of the public pot or the impact of other players' contributions on my gain. I will also consider developing a more strategic approach to token contribution, such as adjusting my contribution based on the contributions of other players or the size of the public pot. Additionally, I will aim to communicate and collaborate more effectively with other players to coordinate our token contributions and potentially increase the overall size of the public pot and the resulting gains for all players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or optimal strategy for contributing tokens that maximizes individual gain. The players seem to contribute varying amounts of tokens in each round, leading to unpredictable public pot sizes and individual gains.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my strategy, I will analyze the past contributions of each player and their corresponding gains to identify any potential trends or patterns. I will then use this information to develop a more informed and rational approach for determining my token contributions in future rounds.\n\nMy new, concise, high level plan is to:\n1. Analyze the past contributions and gains of each player to identify any potential trends or patterns.\n2. Use this information to develop a more informed and rational approach for determining my token contributions in future rounds.\n3. Continuously reflect on the game results and adjust my strategy as needed to maximize my individual gain.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is a inconsistency in my strategy as I have contributed varying amounts of tokens in each round. This inconsistency may have negatively impacted my overall token balance as compared to other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new strategy that aims to contribute a consistent amount of tokens in each round. This will help me maintain a more stable token balance and potentially lead to better overall gains. One possible strategy could be to contribute a fixed percentage of my total tokens in each round, rather than making ad hoc decisions based on the contributions of other players. This will require careful consideration of my current token balance and the potential impact on my future gains, but it should help me maintain a more consistent and effective approach to the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or optimal strategy for contributing tokens that maximizes individual gain. The contributions of each player vary widely, and there is no consistent relationship between the number of tokens contributed and the resulting gain. This inconsistency may be due to the randomness of the public pot multiplier and the fact that each player's gain is determined by the total tokens in the pot, not just their own contribution.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my performance in the game, I will adopt a more flexible and adaptive strategy. Instead of contributing a fixed number of tokens every round, I will analyze the contributions of the other players and adjust my own accordingly. For example, if I notice that other players are contributing a large number of tokens in a given round, I may choose to contribute fewer tokens to minimize the impact on the public pot and maximize my own gain. Conversely, if other players are contributing fewer tokens, I may choose to contribute more to increase the size of the public pot and potentially earn a larger gain for all players.\n\nAdditionally, I will keep track of the total tokens in the game and the average number of tokens contributed by each player in each round. This information will help me make more informed decisions about my own contributions and allow me to identify any trends or patterns that may emerge over the course of the game. By adopting a more flexible and adaptive strategy, I believe I can improve my performance and increase my overall gain in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a lack of consistency in my token contribution strategy. In some rounds, I contributed the maximum number of tokens, while in others, I contributed fewer tokens. This inconsistency may have resulted in lower gains in certain rounds and a less optimal token distribution among players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new, high-level plan that involves contributing a consistent number of tokens in each round based on the average number of tokens contributed by all players. This strategy aims to ensure that I contribute a fair share of tokens to the public pot while also retaining a sufficient number of tokens for myself. By following this plan, I hope to maximize my gains and maintain a more balanced token distribution among all players.\n",

      "learnings": "Reflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a discrepancy between the tokens each player reported contributing to the pot and the actual tokens in the pot. This could potentially indicate a miscommunication or misunderstanding of the rules among the players.\n\nTo mitigate this issue and improve the accuracy of the game, I propose implementing a clearer communication system for reporting contributions. This could include using a shared document or platform where each player can input their token contributions before the round begins, and the game master can verify and update the total pot before the payoff is calculated. Additionally, I suggest reminding all players of the rules and the importance of reporting accurate contributions to ensure fairness and transparency in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a discrepancy between my contributions in the game and the ones recorded by the game master. In the first round, I contributed 5 tokens instead of the reported 6 tokens. This discrepancy could potentially impact my overall strategy and gains in the game.\n\nTo mitigate this potential failure and ensure accurate record keeping, I will make a conscious effort to double-check my contributions before submitting them to the game master. Additionally, I will maintain a personal record of my contributions to cross-reference with the game master's records. This will help minimize any discrepancies and ensure that my strategy remains effective throughout the game.\n\nMy new high-level plan is to contribute a strategic amount of tokens to the public pot based on the current round and the contributions of other players, while maintaining an accurate record of my contributions to ensure the effectiveness of my strategy. This will help me optimize my gains in the game and minimize any potential discrepancies or misunderstandings.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a discrepancy between the number of tokens I reported contributing and the actual tokens contributed in rounds 1 and 2. This could be due to a mistake in recording or reporting my contributions. To mitigate this failure and ensure accuracy, I will make a conscious effort to double-check my contributions before submitting them in future rounds. Additionally, I will consider implementing a system for verifying contributions from all players to prevent any potential errors. My new high-level plan is to prioritize accuracy and transparency in my contributions and work towards establishing a reliable system for recording and reporting contributions in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a pattern in Player 2's token contributions being lower than the average, which could potentially result in a lower overall gain for the player. One possible reason for this could be that Player 2 is not considering the long-term benefits of contributing more tokens to the public pot, focusing instead on retaining a larger share for themselves in each round.\n\nTo mitigate this potential failure, a new, high-level plan for Player 2 could be to adopt a more strategic approach to token contribution. This could involve analyzing the average token contributions of all players and aiming to contribute a similar or slightly above-average amount in each round. By doing so, Player 2 can potentially increase their overall gain in the long run, while still retaining a reasonable number of tokens for themselves. Additionally, Player 2 could consider communicating with the other players to discuss potential strategies and collaborate towards maximizing the overall public pot and individual gains.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a pattern in player 2's token contributions being consistently lower than the average, which could potentially result in lower overall gains for the round and in the long run. One possible reason for this could be that player 2 is not fully understanding the strategic implications of contributing more tokens to the public pot.\n\nTo mitigate this potential failure, a new, high-level plan could be for player 2 to carefully consider the potential gains from contributing more tokens to the public pot in each round, taking into account the total number of tokens contributed by all players and the resulting public good payoff. By making informed decisions based on this information, player 2 may be able to increase their overall gains while still contributing to the creation of the public good. Additionally, player 2 could benefit from discussing their strategy with the other players to better understand their thought process and potentially coordinate contributions to maximize the overall benefit for the group.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that player 2 has contributed fewer tokens than the other players in most rounds, resulting in a lower payoff for themselves. A possible reason for this could be that player 2 is adopting a strategy of minimizing their contributions to the public pot in order to maximize their own token collection. However, this strategy may not be effective in the long run, as the total payoff for all players is determined by the size of the public pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new, high-level plan for player 2 could be to adopt a more cooperative strategy by contributing a larger share of their tokens to the public pot in each round. This approach would increase the size of the public pot, leading to a larger payoff for all players, including player 2. Additionally, player 2 could consider adjusting their strategy based on the contributions of the other players, aiming to contribute a proportionate share to the pot while still retaining a reasonable number of tokens for themselves. This approach would encourage a more collaborative gameplay experience and potentially lead to better overall outcomes for all players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that player 2 has been contributing a relatively low number of tokens to the public pot compared to the other players in most rounds. This strategy may not be optimal as the public good payoff is evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution. Therefore, player 2 may be missing out on potential gains by not contributing more tokens to the public pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player 2 could consider adopting a new strategy where they contribute a larger proportion of their tokens to the public pot in each round. This approach could potentially lead to higher overall gains for player 2, as they would benefit from the increased public good payoff. Additionally, player 2 could also consider coordinating with the other players to find a collaborative strategy that maximizes the overall gains for the group. This could involve communicating with the other players to find a balance between individual and collective contributions that benefits everyone in the long run.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that player 2 has been contributing a relatively low number of tokens to the public pot compared to the other players in most rounds.

This approach could potentially lead to higher overall gains for player 2, as they would benefit from the increased public good payoff. Additionally, player 2 could monitor the contributions of the other players and adjust their strategy accordingly to ensure they are contributing a reasonable amount compared to the group.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a pattern in player 2's token contributions, as they have consistently contributed fewer tokens than some of the other players in most rounds. This could potentially result in lower gains for player 2 in the long run, as the public good payoff is evenly distributed among all players, regardless of their individual contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this potential failure, a new, high-level plan for player 2 could be to carefully consider their token contributions in each round based on the total contributions of the other players. This could involve adjusting their contributions upwards when other players contribute fewer tokens, in order to maximize their potential gains from the public good payoff. Conversely, when other players contribute more tokens, player 2 could consider contributing fewer tokens to retain more for themselves. This strategy could help player 2 to better balance their individual gains with the collective good of the group.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a pattern in player 2's token contributions, as they have consistently contributed fewer tokens than some of the other players in most rounds. This could potentially result in lower gains for player 2 compared to the other players.\n\nTo mitigate this potential failure, a new, high-level plan for player 2 could be to carefully consider the optimal number of tokens to contribute in each round based on the total contributions of the other players and the desired outcome of maximizing individual gains. This could involve monitoring the contributions of the other players and adjusting player 2's contributions accordingly to ensure a more balanced distribution of tokens in the public pot and, ultimately, a higher individual gain.\n\nAdditionally, player 2 could consider communicating with the other players to discuss potential strategies for maximizing individual gains while also ensuring a sufficient public good payoff. This could involve negotiating token contributions or forming alliances to coordinate contributions in a way that benefits all players.\n\nOverall, the new plan for player 2 would involve a more strategic approach to token contributions, taking into account the contributions of the other players and the desired outcome of maximizing individual gains while also ensuring a sufficient public good payoff.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that player 2 has been contributing a relatively low number of tokens to the public pot compared to the other players in most rounds. This strategy may have been an attempt to maximize player 2's own token collection, but it seems to have resulted in lower overall gains compared to the other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new, high-level plan for player 2 could be to contribute a more balanced number of tokens to the public pot and personal collection in each round. This could potentially lead to higher overall gains for player 2, as contributing more tokens to the public pot could result in larger payoffs from the multiplier effect. Additionally, player 2 could consider adjusting their strategy based on the contributions of the other players in each round to optimize their gains.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a discrepancy between the tokens contributed by player 2 and the tokens reported in the game results. In rounds 2, 9, and 11, player 2 reported contributing fewer tokens than what was recorded in the game results. This inconsistency could potentially impact the overall strategy and decision-making for future rounds.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and ensure accurate record-keeping, a new plan could be to implement a clear communication channel for reporting contributions. This could be in the form of a shared document or platform where all players can record and update their contributions in real-time. Additionally, regular checks could be conducted to ensure the accuracy of the reported contributions and address any discrepancies promptly. By implementing this plan, we can improve the transparency and trust within the group, leading to more effective collaboration and better outcomes for all players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a pattern in player 2's token contributions, as they have consistently contributed fewer tokens than some of the other players in most rounds. This could potentially result in lower gains for player 2 in the long run, as the public pot's size is influenced by the total contributions of all players.\n\nTo mitigate this potential issue, a new plan could be for player 2 to consider increasing their token contributions in each round, aiming for an average contribution that is closer to the other players'. This strategy could potentially lead to larger public pots, resulting in higher gains for all players, including player 2. Additionally, player 2 could benefit from analyzing the other players' contribution patterns and adjusting their strategy accordingly to optimize their overall gain in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that player 2 has been contributing relatively fewer tokens to the public pot compared to some of the other players in several rounds. This strategy may have been an attempt to maximize player 2's personal gain, but it seems to have resulted in a lower overall token count for player 2 compared to some of the other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and potentially improve player 2's position in the game, a new strategy could be to contribute a more balanced amount of tokens to the public pot while still retaining a sufficient number for personal gain. This could involve analyzing the average number of tokens contributed by each player and adjusting player 2's contributions accordingly. By contributing a more balanced amount, player 2 may be able to maintain a more competitive token count while still benefiting from the public good payoff.\n\nAdditionally, player 2 could consider communicating with the other players to discuss potential strategies and coordinate contributions to the public pot. This could lead to a more collaborative approach to the game and potentially result in better outcomes for all players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is a discrepancy between the tokens contributed by player 2 and the tokens reported in the game results. In several rounds, player 2 reported contributing more tokens than what was recorded in the game results. This discrepancy could potentially impact the overall strategy and decision-making for the game.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and ensure accurate record-keeping, a new plan could be to implement a more robust system for tracking and reporting tokens contributed by each player. This could include using a digital platform or spreadsheet to record contributions in real-time, or implementing a clear and consistent communication protocol for reporting contributions. Additionally, it may be helpful to establish clear rules and consequences for inaccurate reporting or failure to report contributions promptly. By improving the accuracy and transparency of token contributions, all players can make more informed decisions and maximize their potential gains in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that player 2 has been contributing relatively fewer tokens to the public pot compared to the other players in most rounds. This strategy may have been an attempt to retain more tokens for himself, but it seems to have resulted in lower overall gains for player 2.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new, high-level plan for player 2 could be to contribute a more balanced amount of tokens to the public pot while still retaining some for personal gain. This could be achieved by analyzing the average number of tokens contributed by each player and adjusting player 2's contributions accordingly. By contributing a more balanced amount, player 2 may be able to secure a more consistent and potentially higher overall gain while still contributing to the creation of the public good.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that player 2 has been contributing a relatively consistent number of tokens to the public pot, which is 10 tokens in most rounds. However, there are instances where player 2 contributed fewer tokens, such as in rounds 9, 11, 13, and 15, where player 2 contributed 7, 7, 7, and 20 tokens, respectively. This inconsistency in contribution may have resulted in lower gains for player 2 compared to other players in certain rounds.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player 2 could adopt a more strategic approach to token contribution by analyzing the contributions of other players and adjusting their own contribution accordingly. For instance, if player 2 notices that other players are contributing fewer tokens in a particular round, player 2 could consider contributing more tokens to increase their potential gain from the public good payoff. Conversely, if player 2 observes that other players are contributing more tokens, player 2 could consider contributing fewer tokens to retain more tokens for themselves. By adopting a more strategic approach, player 2 may be able to optimize their token contribution and improve their overall gain in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that player 2 has been contributing a relatively consistent number of tokens to the public pot, which is 10 tokens in most rounds. However, there are instances where player 2 contributed fewer tokens, such as in rounds 7, 9, and 12, which resulted in lower gains for that round. One possible reason for this inconsistency could be that player 2 is not fully considering the long-term benefits of contributing more tokens to the public pot.\n\nTo mitigate this potential failure, player 2 could adopt a new strategy of contributing a larger proportion of their tokens to the public pot in each round, with the goal of maximizing their overall gains over the course of the game. This could involve setting a target for the percentage of their tokens to contribute to the public pot each round, based on the current state of the game and the tokens held by other players. By focusing on the long-term benefits of contributing to the public good, player 2 may be able to increase their overall gains and improve their performance in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that player 2 has been contributing a relatively consistent number of tokens to the public pot, which is 10 tokens in most rounds. However, there are instances where player 2 contributed fewer tokens, such as in rounds 9, 11, 13, and 15, where player 2 contributed 9, 7, 7, and 7 tokens, respectively. These lower contributions resulted in smaller gains for player 2 in those rounds.\n\nOne possible reason for player 2's inconsistent contributions could be a lack of strategic thinking or an inconsistent strategy. To mitigate this failure, player 2 could consider adopting a more strategic approach to determine the optimal number of tokens to contribute in each round based on the total contributions of all players and the potential payoff. This could involve analyzing the trend of other players' contributions and adjusting player 2's contribution accordingly to maximize the potential gain.\n\nA new, concise, high-level plan for player 2 could be to analyze the total contributions of all players before each round and determine the optimal number of tokens to contribute based on the potential payoff. This could involve considering the total tokens in the public pot and the potential gain for each token contributed, as well as the tokens already in player 2's possession. By adopting a more strategic approach, player 2 could aim to maximize the potential gain in each round and improve overall performance in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that player 2 has been contributing a relatively consistent number of tokens to the public pot each round, specifically 10 tokens in most rounds. However, there are instances where player 2 contributed fewer tokens, which resulted in lower gains in those rounds. This strategy of contributing a fixed number of tokens each round may not be the most optimal one, as it does not take into account the contributions of other players or the size of the public pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new, high-level plan for player 2 could be to adopt a more flexible strategy by adjusting the number of tokens contributed based on the contributions of other players and the size of the public pot. For instance, player 2 could consider contributing more tokens when other players contribute fewer tokens or when the public pot is larger, and contributing fewer tokens when other players contribute more or when the public pot is smaller. This strategy would allow player 2 to maximize their gains while also contributing to the public good in a more effective manner.\n",

      "learnings": "Reflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there was a discrepancy in the reporting of the tokens after the first round. The sum of the tokens contributed by all players should have been 25 (5+3+6+10+5), but the public pot contained 29 tokens. This discrepancy resulted in an incorrect calculation of the payoff and the tokens of each player after the first round.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and ensure accurate record keeping, a new high level plan would be to double-check the calculations of the public pot and the payoff before announcing the results to all players. This can be done by independently calculating the total tokens in the public pot and comparing it to the result obtained from multiplying the contributions by two. Additionally, the tokens of each player after each round should be calculated and verified to ensure accuracy. This will help maintain transparency and trust in the game, and prevent any potential discrepancies or misunderstandings.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that in both rounds, I contributed fewer tokens than player 3, who contributed the most tokens in each round. This could potentially result in lower gains for me compared to other players, as the public good payoff is evenly divided among all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to contribute a larger number of tokens in future rounds, with the goal of increasing my share of the public good payoff and ultimately, my overall tokens. A high level plan could be to contribute a percentage of my total tokens in each round, gradually increasing this percentage over time to ensure a more significant contribution. This strategy may help me to achieve a more balanced distribution of tokens between my private collection and the public pot, and potentially result in higher overall gains.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions in the previous rounds have not been optimally strategic. The tokens contributed by each player in Round 1 resulted in a relatively small public pot payoff, which led to a smaller individual gain for all players, including myself. In Rounds 2 and 3, the token contributions increased, resulting in larger public pot payoffs and higher individual gains. However, there seems to be no clear pattern or optimal strategy in my contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my performance in future rounds, I will aim to contribute tokens that maximize the potential public pot payoff while also considering the contributions of other players. This may involve adjusting my contributions based on the total tokens contributed in each round and the desired payoff size. Additionally, I will aim to communicate and coordinate with other players to potentially reach a collective optimal strategy that benefits all players.\n\nIn summary, my new plan is to contribute tokens strategically to maximize the public pot payoff while considering the contributions of other players and potentially coordinating with them to reach a collective optimal strategy.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions in the previous rounds have not been optimally strategic. Specifically, I have observed that my contributions have varied significantly from round to round, and in some cases, have been lower than those of other players. This inconsistency in my strategy may have resulted in lower overall gains for me compared to other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my performance in the game, I will adopt a more consistent and strategic approach to my token contributions. Specifically, I will aim to contribute a proportionate share of the total tokens in each round, based on the average contribution of all players. This approach will help ensure that I am contributing a fair and consistent share to the public pot, while also retaining a sufficient number of tokens for my own benefit. By following this strategy, I hope to increase my overall gains and improve my competitive position in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions in the past rounds have not been optimally strategic. Specifically, I have observed that my contributions have varied significantly from round to round, and in some cases, have been lower than those of other players. This inconsistency in my strategy may have resulted in lower overall gains for me compared to other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a new, high-level plan that aims to contribute a more consistent number of tokens to the public pot each round. This strategy will involve analyzing the contributions of other players and adjusting my own contributions accordingly to ensure that I am contributing a proportionate share of the total tokens. By doing so, I hope to increase my overall gains and bring my token balance closer to that of the other players.\n\nAdditionally, I will reflect on the game results after each round to identify any patterns or trends in the contributions of other players and adjust my strategy accordingly. This self-reflection and adaptability will enable me to respond effectively to the changing dynamics of the game and maximize my potential gains.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern in the number of tokens contributed by each player, including myself, in each round. This lack of consistency in contributions may lead to unpredictable outcomes and potential losses for me in terms of tokens gained.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my strategy, I will aim to analyze the contributions of other players and adjust my own accordingly. Specifically, I will monitor the average number of tokens contributed by each player and try to contribute slightly more than the average when others contribute less, and slightly less when they contribute more. This approach should help me to better balance my contributions and potentially increase my overall token gain.\n\nAdditionally, I will consider the potential impact of my contributions on the size of the public pot and the subsequent payoff for all players. By contributing a larger share when the pot is small, I may be able to increase the overall payoff for all players, including myself, while still retaining a reasonable portion of my tokens for future rounds.\n\nOverall, my new plan is to closely monitor the contributions of other players and adjust my own strategy accordingly to maximize my token gain while also contributing to a larger public pot for the benefit of all players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is a discrepancy in the tokens each player has after each round compared to the total tokens contributed in that round. This suggests that there might be an error in the calculation of the tokens in the public pot or the distribution of the payoff among the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose a new plan to double-check the calculations of the tokens in the public pot and the payoff distribution after each round. This can be done by manually calculating the total tokens in the public pot by summing up the contributions of all players and then multiplying it by 2. The payoff for each player can then be calculated by dividing the tokens in the public pot by the number of players and subtracting their individual contributions. By comparing these manually calculated values with the values provided in the game log, any discrepancies can be identified and corrected.\n\nAdditionally, to ensure the accuracy of the calculations, I suggest implementing a simple error-checking mechanism. For instance, the total tokens in the public pot after each round should always be a multiple of 5, as there are 5 players in the game. If the total tokens in the public pot is not a multiple of 5, it may indicate an error in the calculation and should be investigated further.\n\nBy implementing these checks and double-checking the calculations, we can increase the accuracy of the game results and ensure a fair distribution of tokens among the players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is a discrepancy in my strategy as a player in the game. Specifically, I have noticed that I have contributed fewer tokens in some rounds compared to others, despite the fact that contributing more tokens in a given round would have resulted in a higher personal gain in those instances. This inconsistency in my strategy may be due to a lack of foresight or an insufficient understanding of the optimal contribution level in each round.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will develop a new, high-level plan that involves analyzing the total number of tokens contributed by all players in each round and calculating the expected gain for each possible contribution level based on the total number of tokens in the public pot. I will then choose the contribution level that maximizes my expected gain in each round. This approach should help me make more informed decisions and contribute more consistently to the public pot, resulting in higher overall gains for me and potentially improving my performance in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or optimal strategy for contributing tokens that maximizes individual gain. The contributions of each player vary widely, and there seems to be no correlation between the number of tokens contributed and the resulting gain.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my strategy, I will analyze the data more closely to identify any trends or patterns that may exist. I will also consider the possibility of adopting a cooperative approach by communicating with other players to coordinate contributions and potentially increase the overall size of the public pot, which could lead to greater individual gains for all players. Additionally, I will explore the possibility of implementing a tit-for-tat strategy, where I contribute a certain number of tokens based on the previous round's contributions of other players, in order to encourage cooperation and potentially increase the overall pot size.\n\nOverall, my new plan is to analyze the data more closely, communicate with other players to coordinate contributions, and adopt a tit-for-tat strategy to encourage cooperation and potentially increase the overall pot size, leading to greater individual gains for all players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or optimal strategy for contributing tokens that maximizes individual gain. The players seem to contribute varying amounts of tokens in each round, leading to unpredictable public pot sizes and individual gains.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my strategy, I will analyze the contributions of other players and adjust my own contributions accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to contribute a percentage of the total tokens contributed by all players in each round, rather than a fixed number of tokens. This approach should help me to better respond to the actions of other players and potentially increase my individual gain.\n\nAdditionally, I will keep track of the total tokens contributed by each player over the course of the game and adjust my strategy accordingly based on their past contributions. For example, if a particular player consistently contributes a large percentage of the total tokens, I may choose to contribute a smaller percentage in order to increase my own gain.\n\nOverall, my new plan is to use a dynamic contribution strategy based on the total contributions of all players in each round, with the goal of maximizing my individual gain while also taking into account the actions of other players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that player 3 has been contributing a relatively consistent number of tokens to the public pot, with some variations. However, the gains received after each round have not been consistently high, suggesting that player 3's contributions may not have been optimally strategic. One possible reason for this could be that player 3 has not been adjusting their contributions based on the contributions of the other players and the size of the public pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new, high-level plan for player 3 could be to closely monitor the contributions of the other players and adjust their own contributions accordingly. For example, if player 3 notices that other players are contributing a larger percentage of their tokens to the public pot, they may want to contribute a smaller percentage in order to retain more tokens for themselves. Conversely, if player 3 notices that other players are contributing a smaller percentage, they may want to contribute a larger percentage in order to increase the size of the public pot and potentially receive a larger gain. By adapting their strategy based on the actions of the other players, player 3 may be able to optimize their contributions and improve their overall gains in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a discrepancy between the tokens contributed by each player and the tokens reported in the game results. This inconsistency may be due to a recording error or a misunderstanding of the game rules. To mitigate this issue and ensure accurate tracking of tokens, a new plan could be implemented where each player publicly announces their token contribution before the game master records it in the game log. This will help prevent any potential errors and ensure transparency throughout the game. Additionally, regular checks and cross-verifications of the game results by all players can be carried out to maintain the integrity of the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my strategy in the past rounds has been inconsistent, as I contributed varying numbers of tokens to the public pot. This inconsistency may have negatively impacted my overall token balance, as some rounds resulted in lower gains than others.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my strategy, I will aim to contribute a consistent number of tokens to the public pot in each round. This will help ensure a more stable token balance for me and potentially lead to more consistent gains. Additionally, I will analyze the contributions of other players and adjust my strategy accordingly to maximize my overall gain in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that player 3 has been contributing tokens inconsistently, sometimes contributing fewer tokens than other players in a round, resulting in lower gains compared to some other players. This inconsistency in contribution may be due to a lack of a clear strategy or an inability to optimally assess the optimal number of tokens to contribute in each round based on the total contributions of all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player 3 could adopt a more strategic approach by analyzing the total contributions of all players before deciding on the number of tokens to contribute in each round. This could involve keeping track of the total contributions of all players and adjusting the number of tokens contributed accordingly to maximize individual gain while also contributing enough to the public pot to ensure a reasonable payoff for all players. Additionally, player 3 could consider communicating with other players to coordinate contributions and potentially form alliances or cooperative strategies to optimize overall gains for the group.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is a discrepancy in my strategy as I have contributed inconsistently in some rounds, leading to variations in my tokens after each round. This inconsistency might have resulted in missing opportunities to maximize my gains.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new, high-level plan that focuses on a more consistent contribution strategy. I will aim to contribute a fixed number of tokens in each round, based on the average tokens held by all players after each round. This approach should help me maintain a more stable number of tokens while also ensuring that I contribute a fair share to the public pot. Additionally, I will closely monitor the contributions of other players and adjust my strategy accordingly to optimize my gains.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a pattern in which Player 3 contributes fewer tokens than some of the other players in most rounds. This could potentially lead to a lower overall token balance for Player 3 compared to the other players. To mitigate this issue, a new plan could be to analyze the contributing patterns of all players and aim to contribute a more balanced or slightly above-average number of tokens in each round. This could potentially result in a more equitable distribution of tokens among all players and a higher overall token balance for Player 3. Additionally, it may be beneficial to consider the potential impact of each contribution on the overall public pot and adjust accordingly to maximize the potential gain for all players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is a discrepancy between my strategy and the optimal contribution level in certain rounds. Specifically, in some rounds, I contributed fewer tokens than the other players, resulting in a lower payoff for myself. This may have been due to a lack of foresight or an incorrect assessment of the other players' strategies.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a more strategic approach by analyzing the contributions of the other players and adjusting my own accordingly. I will aim to contribute a proportionate share of the tokens to the public pot based on the average contribution level of the other players in each round. This will help ensure that I am maximizing my potential payoff while also contributing fairly to the public good. Additionally, I will keep track of the total tokens in my possession and adjust my contributions accordingly to maintain a balanced token distribution among all players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is a discrepancy between my strategy and the optimal contribution level in certain rounds.

This strategy may have been suboptimal as it did not maximize my potential earnings in those rounds.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to analyze the contributions of other players and adjust my strategy accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to contribute a similar or slightly higher number of tokens than the average contribution of the other players in each round. This approach should help me to earn more tokens in each round and maintain a more competitive position in the game.\n\nAdditionally, I will keep track of the total tokens in the public pot and the tokens contributed by each player to better understand the optimal contribution level for each round. This information will help me make informed decisions and adjust my strategy as needed to maximize my earnings.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a discrepancy between the tokens contributed by player 3 and the reported tokens in the public pot for some rounds. This inconsistency may have led to inaccurate calculations of the gains and tokens held by player 3.\n\nTo mitigate this potential issue, a new plan could be to implement a more rigorous verification process for the tokens contributed by each player in each round. This could involve having players confirm their contributions before the public pot is calculated, or using a secure digital platform for token transfers. By ensuring the accuracy of the tokens contributed, the game results will be more reliable, and any discrepancies can be addressed promptly. Additionally, maintaining a clear and up-to-date record of each player's tokens will help prevent confusion and errors in calculating gains.\n",

      "learnings": "Reflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a discrepancy between the tokens each player reported contributing to the pot and the actual tokens in the pot. This could potentially indicate a miscommunication or misunderstanding of the rules among the players.\n\nTo mitigate this issue and improve the accuracy of the game, I propose the following high-level plan:\n\n1. Clearly communicate the rules of the game to all players before each round, emphasizing the importance of reporting accurate token contributions.\n2. Implement a system for verifying each player's reported contributions, such as having players sign off on a sheet or using a digital platform for reporting contributions.\n3. Encourage open communication among players to discuss their thought processes and strategies for contributing tokens, promoting transparency and trust within the group.\n4. Consider implementing consequences for inaccurate reporting, such as deducting tokens or imposing penalties, to discourage dishonesty and promote accountability.\n\nBy implementing these measures, we can improve the accuracy of the game and reduce the potential for discrepancies or misunderstandings, leading to a more fair and enjoyable experience for all players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that in both rounds, I contributed fewer tokens than player 1 and player 5, resulting in lower gains for myself compared to those players. A possible reason for this could be an insufficient understanding of the optimal strategy for contributing tokens in this game.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to analyze the contributions of other players and adjust my strategy accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to contribute a proportionally larger number of tokens to the public pot when other players contribute a smaller percentage of their tokens. This approach should help me to secure a more equitable share of the public good payoff and improve my overall token balance.\n\nAdditionally, I will reflect on the potential benefits of cooperating with other players by contributing more tokens to the public pot, as this could lead to higher payoffs for all players in the long run. By striking a balance between contributing to the public good and retaining tokens for myself, I hope to maximize my overall gains in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions in the previous rounds have not been optimally strategic. In particular, in Round 1, I contributed fewer tokens than player 4 despite having more tokens initially, resulting in a lower payoff for myself. In Round 2, I contributed the same number of tokens as player 4, who had fewer tokens initially, which may have been a missed opportunity to gain more tokens for myself. In Round 3, I contributed more tokens than in the previous round, but still less than some other players, resulting in a lower payoff than possible.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to adopt a more strategic approach in future rounds by considering the initial token holdings of each player and the potential impact of my contribution on the public pot and subsequent payoff. Specifically, I will aim to contribute a number of tokens that maximizes my potential payoff while also taking into account the contributions of other players. This may involve contributing more tokens when other players contribute fewer tokens, or contributing fewer tokens when other players contribute more tokens, in order to maintain a balance and maximize my overall gain.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions in the previous rounds have not been optimally strategic. Specifically, in some rounds, I contributed fewer tokens than other players, resulting in lower gains for myself. To mitigate this failure, I will aim to contribute a consistent number of tokens each round that is closer to the average of the other players' contributions. This strategy should help ensure that I receive a more equitable share of the public good payoff and maintain a more balanced token balance with the other players. Additionally, I will reflect on the specific reasons for any deviations from this strategy in future rounds and adjust accordingly.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or optimal strategy for contributing tokens that maximizes individual gain. The contributions made by each player vary widely in each round, and there seems to be no correlation between the number of tokens contributed and the resulting gain.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my strategy, I will analyze the historical data to identify trends and patterns, if any, in the contributions made by each player and the resulting payoffs. I will also consider the possibility of adopting a mixed strategy, where I contribute different numbers of tokens in each round based on the contributions of other players and the size of the public pot. This approach may help me to optimize my token contributions and maximize my overall gain in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is a trend of other players contributing more tokens to the public pot than you in most rounds, resulting in a lower payoff for you compared to them. This strategy of contributing fewer tokens may not be optimal as it results in a smaller share of the public good payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new, high-level plan would be to analyze the contributions of other players and adjust your token contribution accordingly. If other players are contributing a larger number of tokens, you could consider increasing your contribution to maintain a more balanced distribution and secure a fairer share of the public good payoff. Conversely, if other players are contributing fewer tokens, you could consider contributing less to maximize your private collection while still contributing enough to ensure a positive public good payoff for all players.\n\nAdditionally, it may be beneficial to communicate with other players and coordinate contributions to optimize the overall payoff for all players. This could involve negotiating a target contribution level or adopting a cooperative strategy to maximize the total tokens in the public pot and ensure a larger payoff for all players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is a trend where player 4 contributes more tokens to the public pot than the other players in most rounds. This strategy, while potentially beneficial for creating a larger public good and thus higher gains for all players, seems to have led to a decrease in player 4's tokens compared to the other players. A possible reason for this failure could be that player 4 is contributing too many tokens relative to their starting tokens, leading to a smaller personal token balance after each round.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new, concise, high level plan for player 4 could be to adopt a more balanced contribution strategy. This could involve contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot each round, while also retaining a sufficient number of tokens for personal gain. By doing so, player 4 can aim to maintain a more even token balance with the other players, while still contributing to the creation of a larger public good. This strategy may result in smaller gains in each round, but it could lead to a more stable and sustainable token balance over the course of the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or consistent strategy in my token contributions that would maximize my gains in this public goods game. In some rounds, contributing fewer tokens resulted in lower gains, while in other rounds, contributing more tokens did not lead to significantly higher gains.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my strategy, I will aim to analyze the contributions of other players and adjust my own contributions accordingly. Specifically, I will monitor the average number of tokens contributed by each player and try to contribute slightly more than the average when other players contribute fewer tokens, and slightly less when they contribute more tokens. This approach should help me to optimize my token contributions and maximize my gains in the long run.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or optimal strategy for contributing tokens that maximizes individual gain. The contributions of each player vary widely, and there seems to be no correlation between the number of tokens contributed and the resulting gain.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my strategy, I will analyze the data more closely to identify any trends or patterns that may exist. I will also consider the possibility of adopting a cooperative approach by communicating with other players and coordinating our contributions to maximize the public pot and, in turn, our individual gains. Additionally, I will explore the possibility of implementing a tit-for-tat strategy, where I contribute a certain number of tokens based on the previous round's contributions of other players, to encourage cooperation and ensure a more stable and consistent gain for all players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a pattern where player 4 contributes fewer tokens than some of the other players in most rounds. This could potentially result in lower gains for player 4 compared to the other players. To mitigate this issue, a new plan could be to analyze the contributions of each player and adjust player 4's strategy accordingly. For instance, if player 4 notices that they are consistently contributing fewer tokens than the other players, they could consider increasing their contributions in future rounds to aim for a more balanced distribution of tokens between the public pot and their private collection. Additionally, player 4 could consider communicating with the other players to discuss potential strategies and coordinate contributions to maximize individual gains while also contributing sufficiently to the public pot.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or consistent strategy in the number of tokens contributed by player 4. In some rounds, player 4 contributes the same number of tokens as other players, while in other rounds, player 4 contributes significantly more or less. This inconsistency may be contributing to player 4's lower token balance compared to other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new, high-level plan for player 4 could be to adopt a more strategic approach to token contribution. Player 4 could analyze the contributions of other players and adjust their own contribution accordingly to maximize their gain. For example, if player 4 notices that other players are consistently contributing a large number of tokens, player 4 could contribute fewer tokens to retain more for themselves. Conversely, if player 4 notices that other players are contributing fewer tokens, player 4 could contribute more tokens to increase the size of the public pot and potentially earn a larger gain. By adopting a more strategic approach, player 4 may be able to improve their token balance and compete more effectively with other players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is a discrepancy in my token contribution strategy. Specifically, I have noticed that I have contributed fewer tokens than some of the other players in several rounds, resulting in a lower token balance for myself compared to my opponents. This strategy may not be optimal as it could lead to a lower overall payoff for me in the long run.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to contribute a more consistent and strategic number of tokens to the public pot in each round. One possible strategy could be to contribute a percentage of my current token balance to the pot each round, rather than a fixed number of tokens. This approach would allow me to maintain a more balanced token balance while still contributing to the creation of the public good. Additionally, I will pay close attention to the contributions of my opponents and adjust my strategy accordingly to ensure that I am not consistently contributing less than them. By implementing this strategy, I hope to improve my token balance and overall payoff in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or consistent strategy in my token contributions that would maximize my gains in this public goods game. In some rounds, I contributed fewer tokens than other players, resulting in lower gains, while in other rounds, I contributed the same or more tokens as other players, leading to similar or slightly higher gains.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my performance, I will adopt a more strategic approach by analyzing the contributions of other players and adjusting my own contributions accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to contribute a proportionally larger share of tokens when other players contribute less, in order to increase the size of the public pot and maximize the overall gain for all players. Conversely, when other players contribute a larger share, I will contribute a smaller proportion to minimize my individual cost while still ensuring a reasonable contribution to the public good. By implementing this strategy, I aim to increase my overall gains and improve my performance in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a discrepancy between the number of tokens player 4 contributes and the number reported by the game master. In some rounds, player 4 reportedly contributed more tokens than what was recorded by the game master. This discrepancy could potentially impact the overall strategy and decision-making process for player 4.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and ensure accurate record-keeping, a new plan could be to implement a more robust communication system between the players and the game master. This could include using a shared document or platform where all players can input their token contributions in real-time, or having the game master confirm each player's contribution before moving on to the next round. By ensuring that all contributions are accurately recorded, players can make more informed decisions based on the most up-to-date information. Additionally, it may be helpful for players to double-check their contributions before submitting them to the game master to minimize any potential errors.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is a discrepancy in the strategy being employed by player 4 compared to the other players. Specifically, player 4 has contributed significantly more tokens to the public pot in rounds 14 and 15 (20 and 20 tokens, respectively) compared to the other players, who have contributed between 7 and 10 tokens in those rounds. This discrepancy in strategy may have negatively impacted player 4's token balance, as evidenced by a lower token count after rounds 14 and 15 compared to the other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player 4 could consider adopting a more balanced contribution strategy in future rounds. This could involve contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot each round, based on an analysis of the potential gains and losses. For example, player 4 could aim to contribute a percentage of their total tokens each round, or they could adjust their contribution based on the total number of tokens in the public pot. By adopting a more consistent strategy, player 4 may be able to avoid the large swings in token balance that have occurred in the past and improve their overall performance in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a pattern in the contributions made by player 4, as they have contributed more tokens in some rounds compared to others. However, the exact reason for this inconsistency is not clear from the provided data. One possible explanation could be that player 4 is adopting a random or inconsistent strategy, or they might be reacting to the contributions of other players without a clear plan.\n\nTo mitigate this potential failure, a new, high-level plan for player 4 could be to develop a consistent strategy based on the average number of tokens contributed by all players in each round. This strategy could involve contributing a fixed percentage of their total tokens to the public pot in each round, or contributing a fixed number of tokens regardless of the contributions of other players. By adhering to a consistent strategy, player 4 may be able to maximize their gains in the long run while also contributing to the public good in a more predictable manner. Additionally, player 4 could benefit from analyzing the contributions of other players and adjusting their strategy accordingly to optimize their gains.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a discrepancy between the number of tokens player 4 contributes and the number reported by the game master. This inconsistency may be due to a recording error or a misunderstanding of the instructions. To mitigate this issue and ensure accurate record-keeping, a new plan could be implemented where each player submits their token contributions to the game master before the round results are announced. This will help prevent any discrepancies and ensure that all players are contributing fairly to the public pot. Additionally, clear communication channels should be established to address any potential misunderstandings or errors promptly.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is a discrepancy in the strategy being employed by player 4 compared to the other players. Specifically, player 4 has contributed significantly fewer tokens to the public pot in several rounds compared to the other players, resulting in lower gains for player 4 and an imbalance in the distribution of tokens among players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player 4 could consider adopting a more cooperative strategy by contributing a larger share of their tokens to the public pot in each round. This approach would increase the size of the public good payoff, resulting in higher gains for all players, including player 4. Additionally, player 4 could communicate with the other players to discuss the importance of cooperation and the potential benefits of contributing more tokens to the public pot. By working together, the players can maximize their collective gains and ensure a more equitable distribution of tokens.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there seems to be a discrepancy between my strategy and the optimal contribution level in certain rounds. Specifically, in some rounds, I contributed fewer tokens than the other players, resulting in lower gains and a slower accumulation of tokens compared to them.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to analyze the contribution patterns of the other players and adjust my strategy accordingly. I will aim to contribute a similar or slightly higher number of tokens than the average contribution of the other players in each round. This approach should help me to maintain a more competitive token balance and potentially increase my overall gains in the game.\n\nAdditionally, I will consider the potential impact of my contributions on the public pot and the resulting payoff for all players. By contributing a reasonable amount, I can help ensure a larger public pot and a more significant payoff for all players, including myself. This approach should not only benefit me but also contribute to a more collaborative and equitable gameplay experience for all participants.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that in most rounds, player 4 contributed the same number of tokens as some other players, which may indicate a lack of strategic thinking or an inconsistent contribution strategy. This could potentially result in lower gains compared to other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new, high-level plan for player 4 could be to adopt a more flexible contribution strategy based on the number of tokens contributed by other players in each round. For instance, player 4 could aim to contribute a proportionally larger number of tokens when other players contribute fewer tokens, and vice versa. This approach could help player 4 maximize their gains by adjusting their contribution to the public pot based on the actions of other players. Additionally, player 4 could consider analyzing the past contribution patterns of other players to anticipate their moves and make more informed decisions.\n",
