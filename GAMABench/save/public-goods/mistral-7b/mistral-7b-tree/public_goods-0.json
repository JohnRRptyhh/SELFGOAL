In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Be prepared for zero contributions from other players: Player_0 should be prepared for the possibility of zero contributions from other players in some rounds. In these cases, they might consider contributing more tokens to increase their chances of a larger payout, while still maintaining a sufficient safety net.\n - Identify potential cooperative partners: Player_0 could analyze the behavior of other players and identify those who have consistently contributed a significant amount to the public pot. These players could be potential cooperative partners for building a larger safety net.\n - Maintain a minimum contribution level: Player_0 might also aim to maintain a minimum contribution level to ensure they are not falling too far behind other players in terms of overall token accumulation. This could help player_0 avoid falling into a disadvantageous position and allow them to continue contributing to the game in a meaningful way.\n - Consider long-term gains: Player_0 should consider the long-term gains of contributing to the public pot, as larger payoffs for all players could potentially lead to a better overall outcome for Player_0 as well. However, they should also balance this against their need to maintain a safety net and reach their primary goal.\n - Consider the minimum number of tokens to contribute in each round: Player_0 should calculate the minimum number of tokens they need to contribute in each round to ensure they reach their primary goal, while also considering the potential impact on the public pot and the tokens held by other players.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

        "0": "Be prepared for zero contributions from other players: Player_0 should be prepared for the possibility of zero contributions from other players in some rounds. In these cases, they might consider contributing more tokens to increase their chances of a larger payout, while still maintaining a sufficient safety net.",
        "1": "Stay informed about game rules: Player_0 should stay informed about any changes to the game rules, as these could significantly impact their contribution strategy. For example, if the game rules are changed to allow players to contribute more tokens in certain rounds, Player_0 might adjust their strategy accordingly to maximize their gains.",
        "2": "Identify potential cooperative partners: Player_0 could analyze the behavior of other players and identify those who have consistently contributed a significant amount to the public pot. These players could be potential cooperative partners for building a larger safety net.",
        "3": "Consider the long-term benefits: While the immediate goal is to build a larger safety net, Player_0 should also consider the long-term benefits of cooperation. By working together with other players, they may be able to create a more stable and sustainable system for token distribution.",
        "4": "Consider the impact on individual gains: While cooperation can lead to larger safety nets and potentially higher overall gains for the group, it may also result in lower individual gains for each player. Player_0 should weigh the benefits of cooperation against the potential cost to their own tokens and consider their long-term goals in the game.",
        "5": "Maintain a minimum contribution level: Player_0 might also aim to maintain a minimum contribution level to ensure they are not falling too far behind other players in terms of overall token accumulation. This could help player_0 avoid falling into a disadvantageous position and allow them to continue contributing to the game in a meaningful way.",
        "6": "Consider long-term gains: Player_0 should consider the long-term gains of contributing to the public pot, as larger payoffs for all players could potentially lead to a better overall outcome for Player_0 as well. However, they should also balance this against their need to maintain a safety net and reach their primary goal.",
        "7": "Stay focused on the primary goal: While preparing for unexpected events is important, Player_0 should not lose sight of their primary goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens by the end of the game. They should aim to contribute enough tokens to the public pot to ensure they receive a reasonable payout, while still maintaining a sufficient safety net.",
        "8": "Monitor the tokens of other players: Player_0 should keep track of the tokens held by other players to assess their own chances of reaching the primary goal.",
        "9": "Consider the minimum number of tokens to contribute in each round: Player_0 should calculate the minimum number of tokens they need to contribute in each round to ensure they reach their primary goal, while also considering the potential impact on the public pot and the tokens held by other players.",
        "10": "Consider the impact of the public good payout: Player_0 should consider the potential impact of the public good payout on their overall strategy. For example, if the public good payout is consistently large, player_0 may be able to afford to contribute fewer tokens in some rounds while still benefiting from the larger payout.",
        "11": "Consider the impact of the game length: Player_0 should consider the length of the game and adjust their strategy accordingly. For example, if the game is nearing its end, player_0 may need to contribute more tokens in each round to ensure they reach their primary goal before the game ends.",
        "12": "Maintain a safety net: While monitoring other players' contributions, player_0 should also maintain a safety net of tokens to ensure they have enough tokens to reach their goal of more than 30 tokens by the end of the game. This safety net can help player_0 weather any unexpected expenses or low contribution rounds.",
        "13": "Keep a reserve of tokens: Player_0 may consider keeping a reserve of tokens to use in situations where they need to contribute more than usual or when contribution patterns are uncertain. This can help ensure that they receive the public good payoff while still maximizing their personal gain.",

        "15": "Consider the potential payoff from contributing to the public pot versus retaining tokens for personal gain: If the potential payoff from contributing to the public pot is significantly larger than the potential gain from retaining tokens, consider contributing a larger number of tokens.",
        "16": "Consider the potential impact of your contribution on the distribution of tokens among players: If your contribution would significantly shift the distribution of tokens in favor of yourself or a particular alliance, consider adjusting your contribution to maintain a more balanced distribution.",
        "17": "Maintain a balance between private and public collections: Player_0 might aim to maintain a balance between their private and public collections, to ensure they have enough tokens to reach their goal while also contributing to the public pot.",
        "18": "Adjust contributions based on the size of the public good payoff: Player_0 might adjust their contributions based on the size of the public good payoff in each round. For example, they might contribute more in rounds where the public good payoff is larger, to maximize their overall gain.",
        "19": "Consider the potential impact of external factors on the game, such as changes in the rules or the behavior of other players: Adjust your contribution strategy accordingly to adapt to these changes and maintain a competitive advantage.",
        "20": "Build alliances: Player_0 might aim to build alliances with other players, either through verbal or nonverbal communication, to coordinate contributions and maintain a consistent size of the public pot. This could potentially help ensure that player_0 has enough tokens to maintain their safety net while still contributing to the public pot.",
        "21": "Set a target personal gain: Player_0 should determine a target personal gain they aim to achieve by the end of the game, based on their overall objective of accumulating more than 30 tokens. They can then calculate the average personal gain they need to achieve in each round to reach this target.",
        "22": "Adjust contributions based on payoffs: Consider the payoffs you have received in previous rounds and adjust your contributions accordingly. For example, if you have received larger payoffs in rounds where you contributed more tokens, you might want to contribute more tokens in future rounds to maximize your overall gain.",
        "23": "Cooperate with other players: Consider cooperating with other players by contributing more tokens to the public pot in rounds where you believe it will benefit the group as a whole, even if it means sacrificing some personal gain. This could potentially lead to a better overall outcome for all players involved.",
        "24": "Identify trending behavior: Player_0 should also look for trends in the contributions of other players. For example, if a player who previously contributed a large number of tokens suddenly contributes very few, Player_0 may want to contribute fewer tokens in the next round as well.",
        "25": "Contributing more tokens in rounds where other players contribute less to increase the chances of reaching the goal faster: Player_0 can strategically increase their contributions in rounds where other players contribute less, aiming to accelerate the progress towards the goal of having more than 30 tokens.",
        "26": "Propose contribution targets: Player_0 can propose contribution targets for the alliance, based on their analysis of the game so far and their assessment of the potential gains from coordinated contributions. They can suggest targets that are achievable for all alliance members and that maximize the overall gain for the alliance.",
        "27": "Monitor contributions: Player_0 should monitor the contributions of their alliance partners and communicate regularly to ensure that everyone is on track to meet the agreed contribution targets. They can also adjust their own contributions as needed to maintain the alliance's momentum.",
        "28": "Build a strong alliance: Player_0 should aim to build a strong and effective alliance that can weather the ups and downs of the game. They can work to strengthen the bonds between alliance members and create a sense of shared purpose and commitment to the alliance's goals.",
        "29": "Maintain a balance between individual and alliance goals: Player_0 should maintain a balance between their individual goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens and the alliance goal of maximizing the size of the public pot. They should aim to contribute in a way that benefits both their individual goal and the alliance.",
        "30": "Assessing the current state of the game: Player_0 should regularly assess the current state of the game, including the size of the public pot, their current token balance, and the contributions of other players.",
        "31": "Setting a target token balance: Player_0 could set a target token balance as a safety net, based on their assessment of the current state of the game and their progress towards their primary goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens. For example, they might aim to maintain a token balance of 10-15 tokens as a safety net.",
        "32": "Adjusting contributions based on the public pot size: Player_0 could adjust their contributions to the public pot based on the size of the pot. If the pot is small, they might contribute fewer tokens to retain their safety net. If the pot is large, they might contribute more tokens to maximize their gain.",
        "33": "Plan for potential technical difficulties: Player_0 could have a backup plan in place for potential technical difficulties, such as having a backup device or internet connection to access the game platform. They could also communicate with the game master or other players about potential solutions to technical issues, such as rescheduling a round or using alternative communication methods.",
        "34": "Monitor the public pot size: Player_0 should keep track of the size of the public pot before making their contribution decision in each round.",
        "35": "Prioritize self-care: Player_0 should prioritize their physical and mental health to minimize the likelihood of unexpected events that could impact their game performance. For example, they might aim to get enough sleep, eat well, and manage stress to maintain their focus and energy levels during the game.",
        "36": "Monitor other players' contributions: Player_0 can keep track of other players' contributions and the impact they have on the pot size. This information can help Player_0 adjust their strategy to ensure they are contributing optimally in relation to other players.",
        "37": "Update records regularly: The player should update their records of each player's contributions after each round, to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information available. This will help the player stay informed about the current state of the game and make informed decisions based on the most recent data.",
        "38": "Maintain a backup record: The player should consider maintaining a backup record of the contributions made by each player in each round, to ensure that they have a reliable source of data in case the primary record is lost or damaged. This could be done by saving the game results in multiple locations or by creating a duplicate record in a separate document or database.",
        "39": "After each round, record the total number of tokens contributed by all players: This involves keeping track of the total number of tokens contributed by all players after each round of the game.",
        "40": "Record the number of tokens Player_0 has after each round by adding the tokens gained in that round to the tokens they had at the beginning of the round: After calculating the tokens gained by Player_0 in each round, record the number of tokens Player_0 has after each round by adding the tokens gained in that round to the tokens they had at the beginning of the round.",
        "41": "Monitor the payoff: Player_0 should keep track of their individual payoff in each round and adjust their contributions accordingly. For example, if Player_0's payoff is consistently lower than other players, they may want to contribute more to increase their payoff. Conversely, if Player_0's payoff is consistently higher than other players, they may want to contribute less to help bring the group's overall payoff closer to the maximum possible.",
        "42": "Monitor game rules changes: Keep track of any changes to the game rules, such as the number of rounds or the payout structure, and adjust the strategy accordingly. For example, if the number of rounds is increased, Player_0 might aim to contribute more tokens to the public pot in the early rounds to secure a larger share of the overall payout.",
        "43": "Anticipate unexpected events: Be prepared for unexpected events, such as a player dropping out of the game or a technical issue, and adjust the strategy accordingly. For example, if a player drops out, Player_0 might aim to contribute more tokens to the public pot to increase their chances of receiving a larger share of the remaining tokens. If there is a technical issue, Player_0 might need to communicate with the game master to resolve it and adjust their strategy accordingly.",
        "44": "Consider the potential for competition: Player_0 may want to consider competing with other players by contributing fewer tokens in rounds where they believe other players will contribute more. This could potentially allow Player_0 to accumulate more tokens in their private collection and increase their chances of reaching their goal.",
        "45": "Adjust contribution based on consistent contributors: Player_0 can use the information about consistent contributors to adjust their own contribution strategy. For example, if player_3 consistently contributes more than average, player_0 might consider contributing less in rounds where player_3 contributes a large amount, in order to increase their chances of accumulating more than 30 tokens by the end of the game.",
        "46": "Consider coordinating with consistent contributors: Player_0 might also consider coordinating with consistent contributors to increase the overall size of the public pot and potentially increase their own gain. For example, player_0 could communicate with player_3 to agree on a strategy for contributing a certain number of tokens in each round.",
        "47": "Assess the expected public pot size: Player_0 can estimate the expected size of the public pot based on the average number of tokens contributed by other players in previous rounds. If the actual public pot size is significantly larger than the expected size, player_0 can consider contributing fewer tokens.",
        "48": "Calculate the average number of tokens needed per round to reach the goal: (30 - current tokens) / (number of remaining rounds)",
        "49": "In rounds where the calculated average is less than the current contribution level: player_0 should consider contributing fewer tokens to the public pot to retain more tokens for future rounds.",
        "50": "Adjust contributions based on alliances: Player_0 could adjust their contributions based on the contributions of their allies to ensure that the public pot is growing and that they are both benefiting from the alliance.",
        "51": "Monitor other alliances: Player_0 should keep an eye on other alliances and adjust their strategy accordingly. If another alliance is growing faster, player_0 may need to adjust their contributions or find new allies to maintain their position.",
        "52": "Consider long-term benefits: Player_0 should consider the long-term benefits of cooperation and alliances, as they may lead to better overall outcomes for the game and future rounds.",
        "53": "Adjust strategy based on game progress: Based on the current state of the game and the progress towards the goal, Player_0 should regularly assess their strategy and make adjustments as necessary. For example, if the public pot is consistently small, Player_0 may need to contribute more tokens to ensure a larger payoff. Conversely, if the public pot is consistently large, Player_0 may be able to contribute fewer tokens while still achieving their goal.",
        "54": "Build trust: Communication and cooperation between players can help build trust and improve the overall dynamic of the game. Player_0 could aim to build a strong relationship with their allies, and work to maintain open and honest communication throughout the game.",
        "55": "Adjust strategy as needed: Based on the information shared during communication with potential allies, Player_0 could adjust their strategy as needed to maximize their own payoff while also contributing to the overall success of the group. This could involve adjusting their contributions to the public pot, or coordinating with allies to make strategic moves.",
        "56": "Maintain confidentiality: It's important for Player_0 to maintain confidentiality during communication with potential allies, especially if the game platform does not allow for private communication. They should avoid sharing sensitive information that could give other players an advantage, and should be careful not to reveal their own strategy or intentions.",
        "57": "Identify inconsistent contributors: Player_0 should also keep track of which players contribute inconsistently or unpredictably. This information can help player_0 anticipate their behavior and adjust their own contributions accordingly.",
        "58": "Be open to negotiation: Player_0 could aim to be open to negotiation with other players, especially if they notice that their contributions are not aligned with their goals. This could involve proposing alternative strategies or compromising on contributions to reach a mutually beneficial outcome.",
        "59": "Maintain confidentiality: Player_0 could aim to maintain confidentiality about their own token balance and contributions to the public pot, while still being open to communication and collaboration with other players. This could help build trust and prevent other players from taking advantage of the information.",
        "60": "Adjust strategy based on overall distribution goals: Player_0 can adjust their strategy based on their overall distribution goals. For example, if player_0's goal is to ensure a more equal distribution of tokens among players, they may prioritize contributing fewer tokens in some rounds to help ensure that other players also have a fair share of tokens. Alternatively, if player_0's goal is to maximize their own payoff, they may prioritize contributing more tokens in rounds where they believe other players will contribute less.",
        "61": "Consider the potential for risk and uncertainty: The player can consider the potential for risk and uncertainty in the game and adjust their contribution accordingly. For example, they might consider contributing fewer tokens in rounds where they believe the public pot will be larger, as they will earn a larger share of the payoff. Alternatively, they might consider contributing more tokens in rounds where they believe the public pot will be smaller, as they will have a greater impact on the size of the pot and potentially earn a larger payoff.",
        "62": "Communicate with other players: Player_0 may want to consider communicating with other players about the current size of the public pot and their own contribution strategies. This could lead to cooperation and coordination among players, potentially resulting in a better overall outcome for the group.",
        "63": "Consider the long-term goal: Player_0 should keep their long-term goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens in mind when making decisions about contributions. They may need to balance their desire for short-term gains with their long-term goal and adjust their strategy accordingly.",
        "64": "Maintain a balance: Player_0 should aim to maintain a balance between monitoring other players and focusing on their own contributions. They should not become too fixated on other players' contributions to the detriment of their own strategy.",
        "65": "Be cautious of free-riding players: Player_0 should also be aware of players who consistently contribute fewer tokens than others. They might be 'free-riding' on the contributions of others and could potentially undermine the overall success of the group. Player_0 may want to consider adjusting their own contributions in response to the behavior of these players.",
        "66": "Analyze player_4's contribution pattern: Player_0 should analyze player_4's contribution pattern to determine if there are any trends or inconsistencies. For example, they might notice that player_4 consistently contributes a certain number of tokens each round or that their contributions vary widely.",
        "67": "Monitor other players' average contributions: Player_0 can calculate the average number of tokens contributed by each player over the past few rounds and identify any players whose contributions are significantly lower than the average. For example, if the average contribution per round is around 7 tokens, and a player consistently contributes only 2 or 3 tokens, they could be considered a potential free-rider.",
        "68": "Consider communication with other players: Player_0 might consider communicating with other players about their concerns regarding potential free-riders. They could discuss the importance of contributing fairly to the public pot and the potential negative consequences of free-riding. However, they should be careful not to alienate other players or make accusations without solid evidence.",
        "69": "Identify potential alliances or coalitions: By observing the contributions of other players and their interactions with each other, player_0 may be able to identify potential alliances or coalitions that could impact the game dynamics. For example, if two players consistently contribute similar numbers of tokens, player_0 may want to consider forming an alliance with one of them to increase their collective influence on the game.",
        "70": "Consider player motivations: Player_0 can try to understand the motivations behind other players' contribution patterns. For example, a player who consistently contributes large numbers of tokens might be motivated by a desire to maximize their own gain, while a player who consistently contributes small numbers might be motivated by a desire to minimize their own risk.",
        "71": "Consider the number of rounds remaining in the game: Player_0 should keep track of the number of rounds remaining and adjust their contribution strategy accordingly. For example, if there are only a few rounds left, Player_0 might prioritize contributing more to the public pot to maximize their overall gain, even if it means sacrificing some personal gain in the short term.",
        "72": "Test a risk-averse contribution strategy: Player_0 could test retaining a larger safety net of tokens in their private collection to ensure they have enough tokens to reach their goal of 30 or more by the end of the game, even if it means sacrificing some potential gains in the short term.",
        "73": "Analyze the distribution of tokens among players: Player_0 could analyze the distribution of tokens among players after each round to determine their relative position in the ranking. For example, if player_0 notices that they are consistently ranking lower than some other players, they might consider contributing more tokens to catch up.",
        "74": "Assess current expenses: Player_0 should evaluate their current expenses and determine if they anticipate any unexpected expenses in the near future. This could include things like upcoming bills, repairs, or emergencies.",
        "75": "Review past contributions: Player_0 should review their past contributions and adjust their strategy accordingly. For example, if they notice that they have consistently contributed more tokens than other players, they might consider contributing fewer tokens in future rounds to build a larger safety net. Conversely, if they notice that they have consistently contributed fewer tokens than other players, they might consider contributing more tokens in future rounds to maximize their overall gain.",
        "76": "Building a rainy day fund: Player_0 might aim to build a rainy day fund by contributing a certain percentage of their tokens to the public pot and retaining the rest for unexpected expenses. For example, they might aim to contribute 70% of their tokens to the public pot and retain 30% for personal use.",
        "77": "Randomize contributions: Player_0 might also consider randomizing their contributions to add an element of unpredictability to their strategy. This could potentially throw off other players and lead to unexpected gains for player_0.",
        "78": "Maintain a balance between cooperation and competition: Player_0 should aim to maintain a balance between cooperating with the group to increase the overall size of the public pot and competing with the other players to maximize their own gain. This will help player_0 avoid being perceived as too cooperative or too competitive by the other players, and potentially maintain a good reputation within the group.",
        "79": "Keep track of changes in the game: Player_0 should keep track of any changes in the game, such as new players joining or existing players leaving, as this could impact the average contributions of the group and require adjustments to player_0's strategy.",
        "80": "Anticipate other players' strategies: Player_0 can try to anticipate other players' strategies based on their past behavior and adjust their own contribution accordingly. For example, if player_1 has a history of contributing significantly more tokens than the other players, player_0 might choose to contribute fewer tokens in the current round to avoid contributing more than necessary and still receive a reasonable payoff.",
        "81": "Propose a coordination strategy: Player_0 should propose a coordination strategy to their potential allies, such as agreeing on a minimum or maximum contribution level for each round. For example, player_0 might suggest that they and player_3 both contribute 7 tokens in the current round, while player_4 contributes 6 tokens.",
        "82": "Identify potential allies: Player_0 should identify the players who are likely to be cooperative and willing to coordinate contributions. This could be based on their past contributions, communication style, or other observable behaviors.",
        "83": "Establish a communication channel: Player_0 should set up a regular and reliable communication channel with their potential allies. This could be through a messaging app, email, or in-game chat.",
        "84": "Be open to feedback and adjustments: Player_0 should be open to feedback and adjustments from their potential allies regarding the coordination strategy. This could involve adjusting their own contributions or adapting to changing circumstances in the game.",
        "85": "Maintain trust: Player_0 should maintain trust with their potential allies by following through on their commitments and being transparent about their own contributions. This will help build a strong and effective coordination network, which can lead to larger payoffs for all players involved.",
        "86": "Consider the impact of contributions on other players: Player_0 should consider the impact of their contributions on other players and try to make decisions that benefit the group as a whole. For example, if player_0 notices that player_3 is struggling to accumulate tokens, they might choose to contribute more tokens in the current round to help player_3 reach their goal and potentially receive a larger payoff for themselves as well.",
        "87": "Consider unexpected expenses: Player_0 might aim to set aside additional tokens as a buffer for unexpected expenses. For example, they might need to replace a broken appliance or pay for an unexpected medical bill. By setting aside a larger safety net, they can ensure they have the tokens available when they need them.",
        "88": "Adjust safety net based on other players' behaviors: Player_0 might aim to monitor other players' contributions and adjust their safety net accordingly. For example, if they notice that other players are consistently contributing fewer tokens than expected, they might be able to contribute fewer tokens to their safety net and allocate more to the public pot. Conversely, if they notice that other players are consistently contributing more tokens than expected, they might need to increase their safety net to ensure they still reach their goal.",
        "89": "Assessing the likelihood of larger multipliers: Player_0 might aim to assess the likelihood of larger multipliers in upcoming rounds based on historical data or patterns in the game. For example, they might notice that the multiplier tends to be larger in certain rounds or when certain players contribute more tokens.",
        "90": "Maintaining flexibility: Player_0 might aim to maintain flexibility in their strategy and be prepared to adjust their contributions to the public pot and their safety net based on changing circumstances. For example, they might need to contribute more to their safety net in some rounds if they notice that the multiplier is smaller than expected, or contribute more to the public pot if they notice that other players are contributing less.",
        "91": "Communicating with other players: Player_0 might consider communicating with other players to coordinate contributions and build trust. This could involve sharing information about their own contributions and encouraging others to contribute more as well.",
        "92": "Considering the overall distribution of tokens: Player_0 should consider the overall distribution of tokens among players and aim to contribute more to the public pot if they believe this will help ensure a more equitable distribution of tokens among all players.",
        "93": "Balancing personal gain and group benefit: Player_0 should aim to find a balance between contributing to the public pot to benefit the group and retaining enough tokens for their own personal gain. This might involve making strategic contributions based on their assessment of other players' behaviors and the overall distribution of tokens.",
        "94": "Adapting to changing circumstances: Player_0 should be prepared to adapt their contribution strategy in response to changing circumstances, such as unexpected changes in other players' behaviors or changes in the overall distribution of tokens.",
        "95": "Building long-term relationships: Player_0 might aim to build long-term relationships with other players based on cooperation and trust, rather than focusing solely on short-term gains. This could lead to more stable and consistent outcomes for all players in the long run.",
        "96": "Consider the number of tokens each player has after each round: Player_0 can keep track of the number of tokens each player has after each round and adjust their strategy accordingly. For example, if player_2 has a significantly larger number of tokens than the other players, player_0 might consider contributing fewer tokens to prevent player_2 from accumulating an unfair advantage.",
        "97": "Look for patterns in other players' behavior: Player_0 can try to identify any patterns or trends in the behavior of other players, such as consistent contributions or sudden changes in behavior. By understanding these patterns, player_0 can adjust their strategy to take advantage of opportunities or mitigate risks.",
        "98": "Be flexible: Player_0 and their alliance partners should be flexible in their alliance-building strategy. They might need to adjust their contributions or communication strategies based on the behavior of other players and the overall distribution of tokens in the game.",
        "99": "Maintain a safety net: Player_0 should maintain a safety net of tokens in their private collection to ensure that they can contribute their fair share to the public pot even if they have a poor round. This will help maintain the trust and effectiveness of the alliance.",
        "100": "Be patient: Building alliances takes time and effort. Player_0 should be patient and persistent in their efforts to build and maintain alliances, even if it means sacrificing some personal gain in the short term. The long-term benefits of a strong alliance can lead to larger payoffs for all players involved."

Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Consider the potential gain from the public good: The player should consider the potential gain they may receive from the public good before deciding on their contribution. If the potential gain is small, the player may contribute fewer tokens to maximize their personal gain.\n - Consider the impact on other players: The player should consider the impact of their contributions on other players. If the player consistently contributes fewer tokens than other players, they may be perceived as free-riding and may face negative consequences from other players.\n - Consider the long-term impact: The player should consider the long-term impact of their contribution strategy. Consistently contributing the minimum number of tokens may lead to a smaller overall payoff in the long run, as the player may miss out on potential gains from the public good.\n - Monitoring other players: The player may keep track of other players' contributions and adjust their own strategy accordingly to ensure they are contributing less than them.\n - Build alliances or coordinate contributions with players 2 and 4: Player_1 might consider communicating with players 2 and 4 to coordinate contributions and build alliances. This could potentially lead to larger payoffs for all players involved.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

        "33": "Anticipate other players' moves: Based on the behavior of other players, Player_1 can try to anticipate their moves in future rounds. For example, if a player has consistently contributed a certain number of tokens in each round, Player_1 might assume that they will continue to do so in the next round. Alternatively, if a player has been contributing fewer tokens recently, Player_1 might assume that they will continue to do so in order to conserve their tokens.",
        "34": "Avoid revealing too much: Player_1 should be careful not to reveal too much information about their own tokens or strategy to other players. They should aim to gather as much information as possible while minimizing the risk of revealing valuable information that could be used against them.",
        "35": "Calculate the total number of tokens in the game: The total number of tokens in the game can be calculated by summing up the tokens of all players after each round. For example, after round 11, the total number of tokens in the game is 145.",
        "36": "Share information about contributions: Player 1 can be transparent about their own contributions and discuss their rationale behind certain strategies. They can also ask for information about other players' contributions and discuss how they might coordinate their strategies to maximize the overall gain.",
        "37": "Be trustworthy: Player 1 should be trustworthy in their communications with their alliance partners. They should follow through on any agreements they make and be transparent about their contributions and strategies.",
        "38": "Maintain a balance between individual gain and alliance gain: Player 1 should aim to maximize both their individual gain and the gain of their alliance. They should communicate openly with their alliance partners and work together to find a strategy that benefits both parties.",
        "39": "Identify potential alliance partners: Player 1 should identify other players who share similar goals and are willing to cooperate in negotiating contribution levels. They can communicate with these players to discuss potential strategies and coordinate contributions.",
        "40": "Communicate effectively: Effective communication is key to successful negotiation and coordination of contributions. Player 1 should communicate clearly and openly with their alliance partners, and be willing to adjust their strategy as needed to ensure a successful outcome for the group.",
        "41": "Coordinate contributions in key rounds: Player 1 and their alliance partners can coordinate their contributions in key rounds to maximize the size of the public pot. For example, they may agree to contribute more tokens in rounds where the public pot is expected to be smaller, or in rounds where they believe other players are less likely to contribute.",
        "42": "Maintain open communication: Player 1 and their alliance partners should maintain open communication throughout the game to ensure that they are working towards the same goal and to address any potential issues or conflicts that may arise. They can use the game platform or other means to communicate regularly and share information about their contributions and strategies.",
        "43": "Adjust strategies as needed: Player 1 and their alliance partners should be flexible and willing to adjust their strategies as needed based on the contributions of other players and the overall state of the game. They may need to adjust their contribution levels or negotiate new agreements to ensure that they are maximizing their gains while still working towards the goal of building a large public pot.",
        "44": "Monitor personal gain: Player_1 should keep track of their personal gain in each round and adjust their contributions accordingly to maintain their buffer. For example, if they notice that their personal gain is consistently higher than their target gain, they might consider contributing fewer tokens to the public pot and retaining more tokens in their private collection.",
        "45": "Anticipate changes in the rules: Player_1 should be prepared for changes in the rules of the game, such as changes to the multiplier or the number of rounds. They might aim to keep some tokens in reserve to adapt to these changes, or they might adjust their strategy to account for the new rules.",
        "46": "Stay informed: Player_1 should stay informed about the game and any changes to the rules or other players' strategies. They might do this by paying close attention to the game log, communicating with other players, or seeking out additional information from external sources.",
        "47": "Stay calm and focused: Player_1 should aim to stay calm and focused during the game, even in the face of unexpected developments. This will help them to make clear-headed decisions and adapt to changing circumstances effectively.",
        "48": "Avoid contributing too much in a single round: Player_1 should avoid contributing too many tokens to the public pot in a single round, as this could leave them with insufficient tokens to build a buffer. They should aim to contribute a consistent number of tokens each round, while still contributing enough to maintain their position in the game.",
        "49": "Be open to learning from past experiences: Player_1 should reflect on their past contributions and the game results to identify patterns and trends in their own behavior and that of other players. This will help them make more informed decisions in future rounds and adjust their strategy as needed.",

        "51": "Estimate the number of remaining rounds: Player_1 could try to estimate the number of remaining rounds by observing the behavior of other players and the overall distribution of tokens in the game. For example, if most players have contributed a significant portion of their tokens, it may indicate that there are fewer rounds remaining.",
        "52": "Engage in communication with other players: Player_1 could try to gather information directly from other players by asking them about their strategies or intentions. They could also try to infer information from their conversations with other players.",
        "53": "Keep track of the game rules: Player_1 should make sure they have a clear understanding of the game rules, including the number of rounds, the contribution limit, and the payout structure. This information could help them make informed decisions about their contributions and overall strategy.",
        "54": "Monitor game master announcements: Player_1 could aim to pay close attention to any announcements or updates from the game master, as they may provide valuable information about the number of remaining rounds or other game mechanics.",
        "55": "Be cautious: Player_1 should be cautious when communicating with other players or the game master, as they may have their own agendas or strategies. They should aim to gather as much information as possible while minimizing the risk of revealing too much about their own strategy or intentions.",
        "56": "Calculate the average tokens contributed by all players: The average can be calculated by summing up the total tokens contributed by all players and dividing it by the total number of players.",
        "57": "Determine consistency in above-average contributions: For each player, check how many rounds they have contributed above the average. Players who consistently contribute above the average in most or all rounds can be identified as potential high contributors.",
        "58": "Identify consistent high contributors: Player 1 should keep track of which players consistently contribute a large number of tokens to the public pot. This information can help Player 1 make strategic decisions about their own contributions in future rounds.",
        "59": "Consider other factors: Player 1 should also consider other factors that could influence a player's contributions, such as their position in the game (e.g., first or last player to contribute), their overall token balance, or their behavior in previous rounds.",
        "60": "Observe and record each player's contribution pattern: Player 1 should keep track of the number of tokens contributed by each player in each round and any noticeable trends or deviations.",
        "61": "Monitor player communication: Player 1 should pay attention to any communication between players, both verbal and nonverbal, that may indicate a reason for a deviation from their usual contribution pattern.",
        "62": "Identify the round with suspected deviation: Player 1 should first identify the specific round in which they suspect a deviation from another player. This can be done by analyzing the game results and looking for contributions that seem significantly lower or higher than what was expected based on previous contributions or the player's average contribution.",
        "63": "Gather information: Player 1 should gather as much information as possible about the suspected player's contribution and behavior in that round. This can include looking at the tokens contributed by all players in that round, as well as any communication or body language that may have indicated a particular strategy or motivation.",
        "64": "Consider the potential impact of the suspected deviation: Player 1 should consider the potential impact of the suspected deviation on their own strategy and the overall outcome of the game. They should also consider the potential impact on other players and the fairness of the game.",
        "65": "Approach the suspected player: Player 1 should approach the suspected player in a respectful and non-confrontational manner to ask about their contribution in the suspected round. They should be open to the possibility that there may be a valid explanation for the deviation and be prepared to listen carefully to the suspected player's response.",
        "66": "Evaluate the response: Player 1 should evaluate the suspected player's response carefully and consider whether it provides a satisfactory explanation for the deviation. They should also consider the potential implications of the response for their own strategy and the overall outcome of the game.",
        "67": "Maintain a long-term perspective: Player 1 should keep in mind that the game consists of multiple rounds, and their strategy should be adaptive to changing circumstances while keeping their primary goal in mind.",
        "68": "Collaborate with other players: Player 1 could consider collaborating with other players to share information and coordinate contributions, potentially leading to a better overall outcome for the group.",
        "69": "Communicate with other players: If Player 1 suspects that a change in contribution pattern is due to a specific reason, such as a personal emergency or a change in strategy, they may want to communicate with the affected player to understand the situation and adjust their own strategy accordingly.",
        "70": "Consider player motivations: Player 1 should try to understand the motivations behind each player's contributions. For example, a player who consistently contributes the least may be trying to conserve their tokens for a later round, or they may be trying to manipulate the game in their favor.",
        "71": "Monitor the overall distribution of tokens: Player_1 should also keep an eye on the overall distribution of tokens among all players to ensure that the game remains fair and that no single player has an unfair advantage. If the distribution becomes significantly skewed, Player_1 may need to take action to correct the imbalance, such as negotiating with other players or reporting the issue to the game master.",
        "72": "Consider communication with Players 2 and 3: If Player_1 notices a consistent pattern of Players 2 and 3 contributing less than their fair share, they may consider communicating with them to discuss the issue and potentially reach an agreement on more equitable contributions. This could lead to a better overall outcome for all players, as a larger public pot will result in larger gains for everyone.",
        "73": "Initiate conversations: Player_1 could start conversations with Players 2 and 3 during breaks or before the game starts. This could help establish a friendly and open communication channel.",
        "74": "Show genuine interest: Player_1 could ask open-ended questions and actively listen to the responses of Players 2 and 3. This could help build trust and create a sense of connection.",
        "75": "Share personal stories: Player_1 could share personal stories or experiences that are relevant to the game or the interests of Players 2 and 3. This could help create a sense of common ground and build a stronger rapport.",
        "76": "Offer assistance: Player_1 could offer to help Players 2 and 3 with their strategies or provide advice based on their observations of the game. This could help build a sense of collaboration and teamwork.",
        "77": "Be respectful and considerate: Player_1 should be respectful and considerate in their interactions with Players 2 and 3. This could help build trust and create a positive atmosphere.",
        "78": "Be consistent: Player_1 should consistently engage in rapport-building behaviors to maintain the relationship. This could help build a long-term rapport and create a more cooperative and collaborative game environment.",
        "79": "Be adaptive: Player_1 should be adaptive in their rapport-building strategies based on the responses and behaviors of Players 2 and 3. For example, if Players 2 and 3 seem uninterested in conversation, Player_1 could try offering assistance or sharing personal stories instead.",
        "80": "Be open to compromise: Player_1 should be open to compromise and be willing to adjust their strategy if necessary to maintain a cooperative relationship with Players 2 and 3. This could involve contributing more or less tokens to the public pot, or adjusting their communication strategy to better align with the needs and motivations of Players 2 and 3.",
        "81": "Look for communication or collaboration between players: Player_1 should pay attention to any communication or collaboration between players, as this could indicate coordinated strategies or alliances. For example, if two players consistently contribute similar numbers of tokens and seem to be working together, Player_1 may want to adjust their estimates to reflect this.",
        "82": "Pay close attention to the game master's announcements: Player_1 should carefully read and understand any announcements made by the game master regarding changes to the game rules.",
        "83": "Communicate with other players: Player_1 should try to communicate with other players to gather information about any potential changes to the game rules. They could ask other players if they have noticed any changes or if they have heard any rumors about upcoming rule changes.",
        "84": "Keep track of the public pot multiplier factor: Player_1 should keep track of the public pot multiplier factor and look for any changes to it. A change in the multiplier factor could significantly impact the optimal contribution strategy for each player.",
        "85": "Consider the possibility of token trading: Player_1 should consider the possibility of token trading and how it could affect the game dynamics. If token trading is allowed, Player_1 should monitor the market to determine the fair value of tokens and adjust their contribution strategy accordingly.",
        "86": "Consider long-term goals: Player_1 should also consider their long-term goals in the context of external factors. For example, if they believe that changes in the game rules are likely to persist, they may need to adjust their overall strategy to account for this and focus on building a sustainable advantage rather than trying to maximize gains in the short term.",
        "87": "Use statistical analysis to identify trends: Player_1 could use statistical analysis to identify trends in the data and make more informed estimates. For example, they could calculate the average number of tokens contributed by each player and use this as a baseline for estimating future contributions. They could also look for correlations between players' contributions and other factors, such as their position in the game or their overall token balance.",
        "88": "Consider the potential impact of other players' strategies: Player_1 should consider the potential impact of other players' strategies on their own contributions. For example, if they believe that other players are adopting a cooperative strategy and contributing more tokens to the public pot, Player_1 might be able to contribute less and still achieve their goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens by the end of the game.",
        "89": "Be open to revising estimates of other players' behaviors: Player_1 should be open to revising their estimates of other players' behaviors if new information becomes available. For example, if they previously assumed that a particular player was contributing more tokens than the others, but they notice that this player's contributions have decreased, Player_1 might be able to contribute less and still achieve their goal.",
        "90": "Monitor player behavior: Player_1 should monitor the behavior of other players during the game to gain insights into their strategies and adjust their own contributions accordingly. For example, they might notice that Player 2 starts contributing more tokens in certain rounds, indicating a change in strategy.",
        "91": "Build trust: Player_1 should build trust with their potential allies by consistently contributing their fair share or more to the public pot. This will demonstrate their commitment to the common goal and make it more likely that their allies will reciprocate with similar contributions.",
        "92": "Be flexible: Player_1 should be flexible in their communication and coordination with potential allies. They may need to adjust their strategy based on changing circumstances or unexpected developments in the game.",
        "93": "Maintain a safety net: Player_1 should maintain a safety net of tokens in their private collection to ensure that they can make up for any shortfalls in their contributions or unexpected expenses. This will also give them more flexibility in their negotiations with potential allies.",
        "94": "Be patient: Player_1 should be patient and persistent in their efforts to build alliances and coordinate contributions. Building trust and effective communication takes time, and there may be setbacks or challenges along the way.",
        "95": "Stay informed: Player_1 should stay informed about the overall state of the game, including the contributions of all players and the size of the public pot. This will help them make informed decisions about their own contributions and negotiations with potential allies.",
        "96": "Consider the impact on overall payoff: Player_1 should keep in mind that their contributions to the public pot will be multiplied by a factor of 2, so even small differences in contributions can have a significant impact on the overall payoff for all players.",
        "97": "Consider the player's position in the game: Look at the player's current token count and their position in the game relative to other players. For example, do they have a significant lead or deficit compared to other players, and does this influence their contribution patterns?",
        "98": "Consider the player's overall strategy: Look at the player's contributions in the context of their overall strategy for the game. For example, do they prioritize maximizing their personal gain, or do they prioritize cooperating with other players to create a larger public good?",
        "99": "Monitor changes in the game dynamics: Look for changes in the game dynamics that might influence contribution patterns. For example, do certain players drop out of the game, or do new players join, and how do these changes affect the overall contribution patterns?",
        "100": "Evaluate coordinated strategies: Look for evidence of coordinated strategies between players, such as consistent low contributions in certain rounds or rounds where multiple players contribute the same number of tokens. This could indicate an attempt to manipulate the size of the public pot or influence the distribution of gains among players.",
        "101": "Look for correlations: Look for correlations between a player's contributions and the contributions of other players. For example, if a player consistently contributes more tokens when another player contributes fewer tokens, it could indicate a strategic response to the behavior of that player.",
        "102": "Look for causation: Determine if player_1's contributions are causing player_2 to contribute less or if player_2's contributions are causing player_1 to contribute less. This could involve analyzing the timing and magnitude of their contributions in relation to each other.",
        "103": "Test hypotheses: Form hypotheses about the reasons for the negative correlation between player_1 and player_2's contributions and test them by observing their behavior in future rounds. For example, if the hypothesis is that player_1 and player_2 are trying to maximize their individual gains, then they may adjust their contributions based on each other's actions to maximize their own payoffs.",
        "104": "Adjust strategy: Based on the analysis of the correlation between player_1 and player_2's contributions, adjust the strategy accordingly. For example, if the negative correlation is consistent and significant, then player_1 may want to consider cooperating more with player_2 to increase the overall size of the public pot and potentially increase their own payoff. Alternatively, player_1 may want to compete more aggressively with player_2 to maximize their individual gain.",
        "105": "Identify potential free-riding: Analyze the contributions of each player in relation to the overall size of the public pot to identify any potential free-riding behavior. For example, player_5 has consistently contributed the least number of tokens, indicating a potential free-riding strategy.",
        "106": "Identify potential cooperation: Analyze the contributions of different pairs of players to identify any potential cooperation or coordinated strategies. For example, player_1 and player_3 have contributed similar amounts in some rounds, indicating a possible cooperation or coordinated strategy to maximize the size of the public pot.",
        "107": "Consider the potential reasons for any changes in player behavior.: For example, is player_4 conserving their tokens for a later round, or are they trying to signal cooperation to the other players by contributing more in certain rounds?",
        "108": "Look for potential alliances: Observe the contributions of other players and identify any potential alliances or coalitions that may form. For example, do players 3 and 4 consistently contribute similar amounts, suggesting a potential alliance or collaboration?",
        "109": "Maintain a flexible strategy: Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on the observations you make about other players' reactions. For example, if player_1 notices that players 3 and 4 are consistently contributing more than the other players, they might consider contributing more in future rounds to maintain their position in the game.",
        "110": "Communicate with other players (if allowed): If communication is permitted in the game, consider sharing information about player tendencies and strategies with other players to build trust and potentially form alliances. However, be cautious about revealing too much information and potentially revealing your own strategy.",
        "111": "Identify players with significantly fewer tokens: Player_1 should identify players who have significantly fewer tokens than the others and assess whether contributing more tokens to the public pot could help them build up their collection. For example, in the current state of the game, player_2 has the fewest tokens among all players.",
        "112": "Contributing below the average: If Player_1's goal is to contribute less than the other players on average, they could aim to contribute fewer than 6.15 tokens per round. However, this strategy could potentially result in a smaller overall gain, as the public pot and subsequent payout will be smaller when fewer tokens are contributed.",
        "113": "Consider the impact on overall distribution: Player_1 can aim to contribute in a way that minimizes the difference in tokens between players, as this can lead to a more equitable distribution of gains and potentially reduce the incentive for free-riding. For example, if Player_1 notices that one player has significantly fewer tokens than the others, they may choose to contribute more tokens to help bring the distribution closer to equality.",
        "114": "Consider external factors: Player_1 should also consider any external factors that might be influencing the contributions of other players. For example, they might be able to identify patterns based on the order in which players make their contributions, or based on any verbal or nonverbal communication between players.",
        "115": "Adjust strategy accordingly: Based on the identified patterns or trends, player_1 can adjust their own strategy accordingly. For example, they might choose to contribute more tokens when a particular player is expected to contribute fewer, or they might choose to contribute fewer tokens when a particular player is expected to contribute more.",
        "116": "Monitor changes in player behavior: Player_1 should also be prepared for changes in player behavior, as other players may adjust their strategies based on the same information. They should remain flexible and be prepared to adapt their own strategy as needed.",
        "117": "Consider the impact of cooperation on overall game outcome: Player_1 should also consider the potential benefits of cooperation with other players. This approach could potentially lead to better overall outcomes for all players involved, as well as building trust and cooperation among the group.",
        "118": "Consider the impact of competition on overall game outcome: Player_1 should also consider the potential benefits of competition with other players. This approach could potentially lead to better individual outcomes for player_1, but could also result in negative consequences for the group as a whole if the public pot remains too small to provide adequate payouts for all players.",
        "119": "Consider the impact of randomness on overall game outcome: Player_1 should also consider the role of randomness in the game. This information can help player_1 make informed decisions about their contribution level in the current round, based on their assessment of the overall distribution of tokens in the game and the potential impact of randomness on the final outcome.",
        "120": "Monitor token balance: Player_1 should monitor their token balance closely and adjust their contribution level accordingly. If they notice that their token balance is getting too low, they might need to contribute more tokens to the public pot in the current round or future rounds to maintain a balanced approach.",
        "121": "Assess the current state of the game: Player_1 should review the previous rounds' contributions from all players and the resulting public pot size and individual gains. This information can help Player_1 determine the optimal balance between personal gain and group benefit in the current round.",
        "122": "Consider the group's overall progress: Player_1 should evaluate the group's progress towards the overall goal of accumulating a sufficient number of tokens for all players. If the group is behind, Player_1 may choose to contribute more tokens to the public pot to help increase the overall size and potentially earn larger payouts for all players.",
        "123": "Adapt to new players: If new players join the game, Player_1 should adjust their strategy to accommodate the new players. For example, they might contribute fewer tokens in the first few rounds to assess the new players' behaviors and adjust their contributions accordingly.",
        "124": "Be patient: Player_1 should be patient and avoid making hasty decisions based on short-term gains. Instead, they should focus on long-term strategies that maximize their personal gain while contributing to the overall size of the public pot.",
        "125": "Stay focused on the primary goal: While adapting to changing game dynamics, Player_1 should not lose sight of their primary goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens by the end of the game. They should adjust their strategy accordingly to maximize their chances of reaching this goal while also contributing to the overall size of the public pot.",
        "126": "Consider the impact of individual payouts on overall game outcome: Player_1 can also consider the impact of individual payouts on the overall outcome of the game. For example, if player_1 believes that a particular player's large payout in a round will negatively impact the overall distribution of tokens and potentially lead to an unfair outcome, they might choose to contribute fewer tokens in that round to ensure a more balanced distribution of tokens among all players.",
        "127": "Communicate with other players: Player_1 can try to communicate with other players to coordinate contributions and increase the overall size of the public pot. For example, they might suggest a specific number of tokens for all players to contribute in the current round to maximize the public good payoff for everyone.",
        "128": "Determine the minimum safety net: Player_1 could calculate the minimum number of tokens they need to retain in their private collection to ensure they reach their goal of 30 tokens by the end of the game. For example, if they estimate that they need to contribute an average of 5 tokens per round to reach their goal, they might aim to retain 5 tokens as a safety net and contribute 8 tokens per round.",
        "129": "Monitor personal contribution trend: Player_1 could keep track of their personal contribution trend and adjust their safety net accordingly. For example, if they notice that they have been contributing more tokens than average in recent rounds, they might feel comfortable reducing their safety net.",
        "130": "Consider unexpected expenses: Player_1 could factor in potential unexpected expenses and adjust their safety net accordingly. For example, if they anticipate a large expense in a future round, they might aim to retain a larger safety net to cover that expense.",
        "131": "Consider the impact of public pot size: Player_1 could consider the size of the public pot and adjust their safety net accordingly. For example, if the public pot is consistently larger than average, they might feel more comfortable reducing their safety net.",
        "132": "Consider the impact of payoffs: Player_1 could consider the size of their payoffs and adjust their safety net accordingly. For example, if they consistently receive larger payoffs than expected, they might feel more comfortable reducing their safety net.",
        "133": "Identify potential allies: Player_1 should identify which players have consistently contributed more tokens than the average and consider forming an alliance with them. This could be based on their contributions in the previous rounds or on other factors such as communication or cooperation during the game.",
        "134": "Monitor allies' contributions: Player_1 should monitor the contributions of their allies and adjust their strategy accordingly. If their allies contribute more tokens than expected, player_1 may be able to reduce their own contributions and still reach their goal. However, if their allies contribute less than expected, player_1 may need to increase their contributions to make up for the shortfall.",
        "135": "Adjusting contributions based on group dynamics: Player_1 should consider the overall group dynamics and adjust their contributions accordingly. For example, if there are players who consistently contribute very little, player_1 might consider contributing more to help offset this imbalance and ensure that the public pot is as large as possible.",
        "136": "Long-term planning: Player_1 should consider their long-term goals and plan their contributions accordingly. For example, they might aim to accumulate a certain number of tokens by a certain round or focus on building a safety net of tokens to ensure they can contribute consistently in later rounds.",
        "137": "Risk management: Player_1 should manage their risk by considering the potential consequences of their contributions on the group as a whole. For example, they might consider the impact of their contributions on the overall size of the public pot and the potential payoffs for all players, as well as the potential impact on their own token balance and ability to contribute in later rounds.",
        "138": "Conserve tokens for later rounds: If Player_1 notices that the distribution of tokens among players is becoming uneven, they might choose to conserve their tokens for later rounds to help even out the distribution and increase their chances of reaching their primary goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens by the end of the game.",
        "139": "Adjust contributions based on the overall distribution of tokens: Player_1 might aim to adjust their contributions based on the overall distribution of tokens among players. For example, if they notice that they are significantly behind other players in terms of token accumulation, they might choose to contribute more tokens in the next few rounds to catch up.",
        "140": "Consider the impact of contributions on future rounds: Player_1 might aim to consider the impact of their contributions on future rounds. For example, if they contribute a large number of tokens in one round, they might have fewer tokens available in the next round, which could limit their options. Conversely, if they conserve their tokens in one round, they might have more tokens available in the next round, which could give them more flexibility in their strategy.",
        "141": "Stay informed about the game rules and objectives: Player_1 should stay informed about the rules and objectives of the game to make informed decisions about their contributions. For example, if they learn that the game will end after a certain number of rounds, they might choose to contribute more tokens in the later rounds to maximize their chances of reaching their primary goal.",
        "142": "Observe the distribution of tokens in the public pot: Player_1 can monitor the size of the public pot after each round and adjust their strategy accordingly. If the pot is consistently small, player_1 might consider contributing more tokens to increase the overall payoff for all players. Conversely, if the pot is consistently large, player_1 might consider contributing fewer tokens to retain more tokens for themselves.",
        "143": "Testing responsiveness: Player_1 could aim to test the impact of adjusting their contribution based on the contributions of other players. For example, they might contribute more tokens when other players contribute fewer tokens, and fewer tokens when other players contribute more tokens.",
        "144": "Testing communication: Player_1 could aim to test the impact of communicating with other players about their contribution strategies. For example, they might discuss their strategies with other players and coordinate contributions to maximize the overall size of the public pot and the payoffs for all players.",

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Monitor contribution patterns: Player 2 should monitor the contribution patterns of each player to identify any trends or patterns. For example, some players may contribute more tokens in certain rounds, while others may contribute consistently throughout the game.\n - Look for communication cues: Player 2 might also look for nonverbal communication cues from other players, such as body language or tone of voice, to gauge their intentions or reactions to the game. For example, if a player seems visibly frustrated or anxious during a round, Player 2 might suspect that they are struggling to meet their goals and may be more likely to contribute fewer tokens in future rounds.\n - Focus on common goals: Player 2 should look for areas of common ground with other players and focus on working towards shared objectives. This can help build alliances and reduce the likelihood of conflicts arising.\n - Analyze the communication patterns of other players and note any trends or strategies that emerge. For example, do certain players consistently contribute more or less than others? Do they communicate their intentions or strategies to the group?: By identifying communication patterns and strategies of other players, you can anticipate their actions and adjust your own strategy accordingly.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

        "24": "Communicate with your alliance partner: Consider discussing your contributions and the overall strategy of the alliance with your partner. This could help ensure that both players are contributing in a way that maximizes the overall benefit for both individuals and the alliance.",
        "25": "Consider the long-term benefits of the alliance: Keep in mind that the goal is to accumulate more than 30 tokens by the end of the game, but also consider the long-term benefits of maintaining a strong alliance. If contributing fewer tokens in the short term will lead to greater benefits for both you and your partner in the long term, it may be worth considering.",
        "26": "Evaluate the potential for cooperation: Consider the potential for cooperation with other players outside of the alliance. If there are opportunities to cooperate with other players to create larger public pots and greater overall payoffs, it may be worth exploring these opportunities while still maintaining the alliance.",
        "27": "Be prepared to adjust alliances: The game environment is dynamic, and alliances may form and dissolve throughout the game. Be prepared to adjust your strategy and form new alliances as necessary to achieve your overall goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens.",
        "28": "Monitor the token distribution among all players: Keep track of the tokens each player has after each round to assess the impact of alliances on overall token distribution.",
        "29": "Evaluate potential alliances: Consider forming alliances with players who have a similar number of tokens or who have contributed consistently to the public pot. This can help ensure a more balanced distribution of tokens among all players.",

        "31": "Break alliances if necessary: If player_2's alliance results in a significant imbalance in token distribution, they might consider breaking the alliance and contributing more to the public pot to help even out the distribution.",
        "32": "Be aware of any potential conflicts or tensions between players and try to mitigate them, as they could negatively impact the overall distribution of tokens.: Identifying and addressing conflicts or tensions can help maintain a cooperative environment, potentially leading to more favorable token distributions.",
        "33": "Anticipate changes in the game rules: Keep abreast of any changes to the game rules or unexpected events that might impact the distribution of tokens and the overall game dynamics. For example, if the game rules are changed to allow players to trade tokens with each other, player_2 might consider forming alliances with other players to maximize their personal gain.",
        "34": "Use the information gathered from the record of communication to make informed decisions about your token contributions in future rounds, with the goal of maximizing your overall gain while still contributing enough to maintain a record of communication.: Leveraging the insights from the record of communication allows for strategic token contributions that align with your overall goal while maintaining a transparent communication record.",
        "35": "Identify rounds with low gains: Player 2 should also review the rounds where they had low gains and analyze the contributing factors. For example, they might have contributed fewer tokens or other players might have contributed more. Understanding the reasons for low gains can help Player 2 avoid similar mistakes in future rounds.",
        "36": "Keep track of the number of rounds played: Player_2 should maintain a record of the number of rounds that have been completed so far. This can be done by saving the number of game results provided by the game master or by keeping a separate counter.",
        "37": "Check the game log after each round: Player_2 should make it a habit to check the game log immediately after each round to record their tokens contributed, tokens gained, and the tokens held by each player.",
        "38": "Verify tokens held by each player at the end of the game: Player_2 should compare their record of tokens held by each player to the final game results to ensure they match and their record is accurate.",
        "39": "Communicate with other players if necessary: If there are any discrepancies or uncertainties in the game results, Player_2 may need to communicate with other players to clarify their contributions and ensure everyone's records are accurate.",
        "40": "Identify undercontributors: Player 2 should look for players who consistently contribute fewer tokens than the average. In rounds where these players contribute less, Player 2 might consider contributing more tokens to increase the size of the public pot and potentially earn a larger payoff.",
        "41": "Maintain a safety net: Player 2 should consider retaining a certain number of tokens in their private collection as a safety net, in case they need to make up for lower contributions in some rounds or unexpected expenses.",
        "42": "Testing the effect of contributing based on personal gain: Player_2 could aim to contribute based on their personal gain in each round, either by prioritizing their own gain over the public good or by sacrificing their own gain for the benefit of the group. This could involve analyzing the potential gains from contributing to the public pot versus retaining tokens for personal use.",
        "43": "Calculate the average gain per round: Once Player_2 has the total number of rounds and their corresponding gains, they can calculate their average gain per round by dividing the total gain by the number of rounds.",
        "44": "Stay focused on the primary goal: While calculating averages and adjusting strategy are important, Player 2 should always keep their primary goal in mind: accumulating more than 30 tokens by the end of the game. This will help them make strategic decisions that are aligned with their long-term objectives.",
        "45": "Consider the impact on the public pot: Player_2 should also consider the impact of their contribution on the size of the public pot. If they consistently contribute less than the average, the public pot may not grow as large as it could, which could potentially limit the overall gain for all players. Conversely, if they consistently contribute more than the average, they may be helping to grow the public pot, which could potentially benefit all players, including themselves.",
        "46": "Identify inconsistent contributors: Player_2 can identify players who contribute inconsistently, either contributing more or less tokens in certain rounds. For example, Player_1 contributed 10 tokens in Round 11 but only 5 tokens in Round 15.",
        "47": "Maintain a balance: Player_2 should aim to maintain a balance between contributing to the public pot and retaining tokens for their own use. They should not contribute all of their tokens to the public pot, as they will need some tokens to reach their own goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens by the end of the game.",
        "48": "Share information about your tokens and contributions: Player_2 should communicate the number of tokens they have and the amount they plan to contribute in each round to their partners. This will help build trust and allow for better coordination and adjustments.",
        "49": "Be open to feedback and adjustments: Player_2 should be open to feedback from their partners and be willing to adjust their strategy if necessary. For example, if one partner suggests contributing more tokens in a particular round, Player_2 should consider this suggestion and make an informed decision based on the current state of the game.",
        "50": "Use clear and concise communication: Player_2 should use clear and concise language when communicating with their partners. This will help ensure that everyone understands each other's intentions and can make informed decisions based on the information provided.",

        "52": "Consider the long-term impact: Player_2 should consider the long-term impact of their cooperation strategy. For example, if player_2 and another player consistently contribute the maximum number of tokens in each round, they may eventually run out of tokens and be unable to cooperate further. Player_2 should aim for a sustainable cooperation strategy that allows for long-term gains.",
        "53": "Be aware of the risk of free-riding: Player_2 should be aware of the risk of free-riding, where other players contribute less than expected while still benefiting from the cooperation. Player_2 should monitor other players' contributions and adjust their own strategy accordingly to minimize the impact of free-riding.",
        "54": "Build trust: Player_2 could aim to build trust with other players by sharing non-essential information or expressing support for the group's overall success. This could make other players more likely to share information about their average contributions or cooperate with Player_2 in future rounds.",
        "55": "Avoid revealing too much: Player_2 should be careful not to reveal their own average contribution or make assumptions about other players' strategies based on incomplete information. This could potentially put them at a disadvantage in future rounds or damage their relationships with other players.",
        "56": "Consider the overall strategy of the group: Player_2 should consider the overall strategy of the group and the potential impact of their contributions on the group's success. If they believe that the group is working together effectively and making progress towards their goal, player_2 can signal confidence by adopting nonverbal cues.",
        "57": "Use consistent nonverbal cues: Player_2 should use consistent nonverbal cues to signal confidence. This will help build trust and confidence among other players and create a positive group dynamic.",
        "58": "Avoid overconfidence: While signaling confidence is important, player_2 should avoid overconfidence. Overconfidence can lead to complacency and a lack of focus on the game objective. Player_2 should strike a balance between confidence and humility to maintain a productive and collaborative group dynamic.",
        "59": "Adapt to changing circumstances: Player_2 should be adaptable and flexible in their approach to signaling confidence. If the game dynamics change or the group's strategy shifts, player_2 should adjust their nonverbal cues accordingly to maintain an accurate reflection of their confidence level.",
        "60": "Signaling cooperation: Player_2 could aim to use nonverbal cues to signal their willingness to cooperate with other players and contribute to the public pot. This could include nodding in agreement, making open body gestures, or maintaining a friendly facial expression.",
        "61": "Signaling deception: Player_2 could aim to use nonverbal cues to deceive other players about their true intentions or the number of tokens they hold. This could include maintaining a neutral expression, avoiding eye contact, or adopting a guarded body posture.",
        "62": "Engage in strategic communication: Player_2 should try to engage in strategic communication with other players to gather more information about their strategies and motivations. This could involve asking questions, making small talk, or sharing information about their own contributions.",
        "63": "Avoid making hasty decisions: Player_2 should resist the urge to make hasty decisions based on incomplete information. Instead, they should take their time to gather as much information as possible before making a decision.",
        "64": "Stay calm and focused: Player_2 should remain calm and focused during the game, even if other players are making unexpected moves or behaving unpredictably. This will help them maintain a clear head and make rational decisions.",
        "65": "Stay positive and collaborative: Player_2 should maintain a positive and collaborative attitude towards other players, even if they are making decisions that are not in Player_2's best interest. This will help build trust and foster a more productive and enjoyable game experience for everyone involved.",
        "66": "Identify optimal contribution levels: Based on the analysis of the relationship between contributions, the size of the public pot, and individual gain, Player_2 can identify optimal contribution levels that maximize both their individual gain and the overall payoff for all players.",
        "67": "Continuously monitor and adjust strategy: Player_2 should continuously monitor their contributions, gains, and the contributions and gains of other players to adjust their strategy as needed to maximize their individual gain and the overall payoff for all players.",
        "68": "Evaluate public pot size: Player_2 should evaluate the size of the public pot before deciding how many tokens to contribute. If the public pot is small and player_2 is close to their goal, they might consider contributing fewer tokens to maximize their individual gain and reach their goal more quickly.",
        "69": "Consider long-term vs. short-term gains: Player_2 should consider the trade-off between short-term gains and long-term gains. Contributing fewer tokens in the short term might lead to larger individual gains, but could also make it more difficult to reach the goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens by the end of the game. Conversely, contributing more tokens in the short term might lead to smaller individual gains, but could help ensure progress towards the long-term goal.",
        "70": "Respond to other players' contributions: Player_2 could aim to respond to other players' contributions in each round. For example, if another player contributes a large number of tokens, player_2 could contribute fewer tokens in that round to offset their contribution.",
        "71": "Maintain a minimum contribution level: Player_2 should aim to contribute a minimum number of tokens in each round to ensure they receive some gain from the public good payoff. This could be as low as one token, but player_2 should aim to contribute enough to receive some benefit from the public good.",
        "72": "Look for opportunities to cooperate with other players: Player_2 may be able to coordinate contributions with another player to ensure a larger public pot and higher overall gains for both players.",
        "73": "Evaluate potential risks: Player_2 should also evaluate the potential risks of forming alliances. For example, they might consider the possibility that a potential alliance partner could suddenly change their contribution strategy or betray the alliance by contributing fewer tokens in a given round. Player_2 should weigh these risks against the potential benefits of forming an alliance and adjust their strategy accordingly.",
        "74": "Be flexible: Building alliances is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and Player_2 should be prepared to adjust their strategy as needed based on the behavior of other players and the overall dynamics of the game. This could involve contributing more or fewer tokens to the public pot, or adjusting the timing of contributions to maximize the impact of alliances.",
        "75": "Building long-term relationships: Player_2 should aim to build long-term relationships with other players based on trust and reliability. This could involve making small sacrifices in the short term to build trust, and working to find a mutually beneficial strategy for maximizing the overall size of the public pot over the course of the game.",
        "76": "Avoiding manipulation: Player_2 should be wary of manipulative strategies, such as contributing very little to the public pot in order to gain a larger personal payoff. Instead, they should focus on building trust and working towards a fair and equitable distribution of tokens among all players.",
        "77": "Calculate the total number of tokens in the game: The total number of tokens in the game can be calculated by adding up the tokens of each player after the last round (22.4, 26.4, 22.4, 23.4, 27.4). The total is 122.8.",
        "78": "Determine the size of the public pot: The size of the public pot after each round can be calculated by multiplying the total tokens contributed in that round by 2. For example, in round 1, the total tokens contributed were 35, so the size of the public pot was 35 * 2 = 70.",
        "79": "Calculate the number of rounds played: The number of rounds played can be calculated by dividing the total number of tokens in the game by the size of the public pot in the first round. In this case, the total number of tokens is 122.8 and the size of the public pot in the first round was 70, so the number of rounds played is 122.8 / 70 = 1.75. Since the number of rounds must be a whole number, it's clear that there have been 17 rounds played so far (17 * 7 = 119, which is the closest whole number to 122.8 that is less than or equal to it).",

In this case, it will take approximately 7 rounds (33.6 tokens divided by 5.2 tokens per round).",
        "82": "Determine the risk level: Player_2 should assess the level of risk they are willing to take in each round based on their current token balance and their progress towards their long-term goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens. If they feel that their safety net is sufficient, they might be more willing to contribute the average number of tokens to the public pot. If they feel that their safety net is low, they might need to prioritize retaining tokens for themselves.",
        "83": "Assess the current state of tokens: Player_2 should assess their current number of tokens and consider how many tokens they will need to reach their goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens by the end of the game. They should also consider how many tokens they will need to contribute in future rounds to reach this goal.",
        "84": "Build a long-term strategy: Player_2 should consider building a long-term strategy for contributing tokens based on their assessment of the current state of the game and the potential impact of their contributions on future rounds. For example, they might aim to contribute fewer tokens in some rounds to build a safety net for future rounds, or they might aim to contribute more tokens in some rounds to earn larger payouts and potentially catch up to other players.",
        "85": "Consider the impact on other players' trust and cooperation: Player_2 should also consider the potential impact of their contribution strategy on other players' trust and cooperation. Consistently contributing fewer tokens than expected might lead to mistrust and decreased cooperation from other players, which could ultimately result in a smaller public pot for everyone.",
        "86": "Identify potential cooperative partners: Analyze the previous contributions of other players to identify those who have consistently contributed fewer tokens than the average. These players could potentially benefit from cooperation and coordination.",
        "87": "Propose a cooperation strategy: Suggest a cooperation strategy to your potential partner, such as agreeing to contribute a certain number of tokens to the public pot in each round or coordinating contributions based on the overall distribution of tokens.",

        "89": "Build trust and establish a reputation: Cooperating with other players can help build trust and establish a positive reputation within the group. This can lead to more successful cooperative efforts in the future and potentially better overall outcomes for all players involved.",
        "90": "Propose a coordinated contribution strategy: Based on your analysis of other players' contributions and your communication with potential cooperative partners, propose a coordinated contribution strategy that aims to increase the overall size of the public pot. This could involve agreeing on a target contribution level or coordinating contributions in a specific pattern.",
        "91": "Monitor other players' contributions: Keep track of other players' contributions and adjust your own strategy accordingly. If other players deviate from the agreed-upon contribution strategy, you may need to adjust your own contributions to maintain cooperation and coordination.",
        "92": "Be flexible and adaptable: Be prepared to adjust your contribution strategy in response to changing circumstances or unexpected developments. For example, if a player suddenly starts contributing more tokens, you may need to adjust your own contributions to maintain cooperation and coordination.",
        "93": "Consistent contribution: Maintain a consistent contribution level to show reliability and trustworthiness to other players. This could mean contributing a certain percentage of tokens in each round or contributing a consistent number of tokens each time.",
        "94": "Open communication: Be open to communication with other players about their strategies and motivations. This could involve sharing information about past contributions and discussing potential coordination strategies.",
        "95": "Active listening: Listen carefully to other players' perspectives and feedback, and respond thoughtfully and respectfully. This will help build trust and understanding, and make it more likely that cooperation and coordination will continue.",
        "96": "Positive attitude: Maintain a positive attitude towards other players and the game, even in situations where contributions are low or cooperation is difficult. This will help foster a positive and productive game environment, making it more likely that trust and relationships will continue to grow.",
        "97": "Reciprocity: Be willing to reciprocate cooperation and support from other players. This could involve contributing more tokens to the public pot when other players do, or offering assistance or advice when asked.",
        "98": "Patience: Be patient and persistent in building relationships and trust with other players. Trust and cooperation may not be established overnight, but consistent and reliable contributions and open communication can help build a strong foundation for future collaboration.",
        "99": "Consider increasing contribution level: If player_2 determines that their current contribution level is not sufficient to help them reach their goal, they may consider increasing their contribution level in future rounds. However, they should also consider the potential impact on their overall gain and the potential impact on the size of the public pot.",
        "100": "Consider the distribution of tokens: Player_2 can also consider the distribution of tokens among the players. For example, if one player has a significantly larger share of tokens than the others, player_2 might choose to contribute fewer tokens to balance things out.",
        "101": "Anticipate other players' strategies: Player_2 can try to anticipate other players' strategies based on their past behavior and make adjustments accordingly. For example, if player_3 has been contributing consistently low numbers of tokens, player_2 might choose to contribute more tokens in the current round to help offset player_3's low contributions and increase the overall size of the public pot.",
        "102": "Anticipate potential changes in the game: Player_2 should anticipate potential changes in the game, such as other players reaching their goals or the game nearing its end. They might adjust their contributions accordingly to maximize their chances of reaching their goal while also considering the overall dynamics of the game.",
        "103": "Estimate average contribution per round: The player can estimate the average number of tokens they need to contribute per round to reach their goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens by the end of the game. Based on the current game results, the player has contributed an average of 7.33 tokens per round (10 + 7 + 5 + 5 + 4 / 5). However, this is just an estimate, and the player should consider the variability in contributions from other players and potential changes in their own contribution strategy.",
        "104": "Adjust contribution strategy based on cooperation: Player_2 could aim to adjust their contribution strategy based on the level of cooperation with other players. For example, they might contribute more tokens to the public pot when cooperating with other players and retain more tokens as a safety net when not cooperating.",
        "105": "Maintain flexibility: Player_2 could aim to maintain flexibility in their contribution strategy, as the optimal contribution level may vary depending on the contributions of other players and the overall size of the public pot. This could involve adjusting contributions from round to round based on the current state of the game.",
        "106": "Keep a record: Player_2 should keep a record of their own contributions and the contributions of other players in each round. This will help them identify trends and patterns in the contributions of other players.",
        "107": "Consider unexpected expenses: Player_2 could factor in potential unexpected expenses when determining their safety net strategy. For example, they might aim to retain a larger safety net if they anticipate having higher-than-normal expenses in upcoming rounds.",
        "108": "Balance safety net with cooperation: Player_2 could aim to balance their safety net strategy with the desire to cooperate with other players and contribute to the public pot. For example, they might contribute fewer tokens to their safety net in rounds where they believe it would be beneficial for the group to contribute more to the public pot.",
        "109": "Adjust safety net based on game dynamics: Consider the overall dynamics of the game, such as the number of players, the size of the public pot, and the distribution of tokens. Adjust the safety net strategy accordingly to maximize the chances of reaching the player's goals while also taking into account the potential impact on the overall game dynamics.",
        "110": "Communicating with other players: Player_2 might consider communicating with other players to coordinate contributions and build trust. This could involve sharing information about their own contributions and discussing strategies for maximizing the overall benefit of the group.",
        "111": "Adjusting contributions based on game results: Player_2 should review the game results after each round and adjust their contribution strategy accordingly. For example, if they notice that their contributions have consistently resulted in larger public good payoffs, they might consider contributing more tokens in future rounds to further maximize the group goal. Conversely, if they notice that their contributions have not resulted in significant increases in the public good payoff, they might consider contributing fewer tokens in future rounds to focus more on their personal goal.",
        "112": "Monitoring the game progress: Player_2 should keep track of the game progress, including the total number of tokens in the public pot and the tokens held by each player. This information can help player_2 make informed decisions about their contributions in each round and adjust their strategy as needed to maximize their chances of achieving their personal and group goals.",
        "113": "Consider player motivations: Player_2 can try to understand the motivations behind other players' contributions. For example, if a player consistently contributes a large number of tokens, they may be trying to maximize their own gain or build alliances with other players. Alternatively, a player who consistently contributes few tokens may be conserving their resources for future rounds.",
        "114": "Stay flexible: Player_2 should remain flexible and be prepared to adjust their strategy based on new information or changing circumstances. For example, if a player suddenly changes their contribution pattern, player_2 may need to adjust their strategy accordingly to maximize their gain.",

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Consider the impact of learning: Player_3 might consider the learning dynamics of the game and adjust their strategy accordingly. For example, they might observe that other players are adjusting their strategies based on the game log, and adjust their own strategy accordingly in order to stay competitive.\n - Approach potential sources discreetly: The player should approach potential sources of information discreetly, to avoid alerting other players to their interest in the total number of rounds. They could try to engage them in casual conversation or ask indirect questions to gather information.\n - Keep track of contributions: The player should keep track of the contributions of other players, as this might provide clues about their strategy and potential knowledge of the total number of rounds. They might also be able to use this information to make informed decisions about their own contributions.\n - Current token distribution: Player_3 can see the tokens held by each player after each round in the game log. Based on this information, they can identify the players with the most tokens at the current stage of the game. In the given log, players with the most tokens after round 18 are player_1 (30.8), player_4 (23.8), and player_5 (20.8).\n - Avoid reacting to other players' contributions: Player_3 could aim to ignore the contributions of other players and focus solely on their own strategy. This could help prevent player_3 from becoming overly concerned with the actions of others and potentially making decisions based on short-term gains.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

For example, they might suggest a specific number of tokens for all players to contribute in the current round to maximize the potential payoff for everyone.",
        "36": "Estimate the minimum contribution from other players: The player can estimate the minimum number of tokens they expect other players to contribute per round, on average. This can help them determine how many tokens they need to retain in their private collection to ensure they reach their goal, even if other players contribute less than expected.",
        "37": "Consider the standard deviation of other players' contributions: The player can also consider the standard deviation of other players' contributions to estimate the variability in contributions. A larger standard deviation indicates greater variability, which may require the player to retain a larger safety net to account for potential fluctuations in contributions.",

For example, if the game is short, they may not need to retain as large a safety net, as they will have fewer opportunities to make up for any shortfalls. Conversely, if the game is long, they may need to retain a larger safety net to account for potential fluctuations in contributions over a longer period.",
        "39": "Adjust contributions based on safety net: Player_3 could adjust their contributions in each round based on their current safety net balance. For example, they might contribute fewer tokens in rounds where they have a larger safety net, and more tokens in rounds where their safety net is lower.",

For example, they might contribute fewer tokens to their safety net in rounds where they believe it would be beneficial for the group to contribute more to the public pot.",
        "42": "Review and adjust safety net regularly: Player_3 could regularly review their safety net strategy and adjust it as needed based on the current state of the game and their own goals and objectives. For example, they might increase their safety net if they notice that other players are consistently contributing more tokens than they had anticipated, or decrease their safety net if they notice that the overall distribution of tokens in the game is more balanced than they had expected.",
        "43": "Considering the long-term outcome: Player_3 should keep in mind that cooperating with other players in the short term could lead to better outcomes in the long term. By building trust and working together to create larger public good payoffs, player_3 may be able to establish a more cooperative and productive group dynamic that benefits all players.",
        "44": "Building a safety net: Player_3 might aim to retain a certain number of tokens in their private collection as a safety net, in case they need to make up for lower contributions in some rounds or unexpected expenses. However, they should also balance this against the need to contribute enough tokens to reach their goal.",
        "45": "Maintain a balance between cooperation and self-interest: While player_3 should aim to monitor other players' contributions and adjust their own accordingly, they should also maintain a balance between cooperation and self-interest. Player_3 should not sacrifice their own goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens to the point where they are not contributing enough to the public pot, as this could negatively impact the overall outcome of the game.",
        "46": "Adjusting contributions based on gain variability: Player_3 can also adjust their contributions to the public pot based on the level of gain variability. For example, if they notice that their gains are consistently lower in certain rounds, they might choose to contribute more tokens in those rounds to increase their overall gain and offset the lower contributions in other rounds.",
        "47": "Communicating with other players: Player_3 might consider communicating with other players about the variability of gains and the potential need for adjusting safety nets and contributions accordingly. This could lead to more coordinated behavior and potentially better overall outcomes for the group.",
        "48": "Adjust safety net based on game progress: Player_3 could adjust their safety net as the game progresses and new information becomes available. For example, if they notice that the size of the public pot is increasing significantly, they might be able to reduce their safety net and contribute more to the pot without putting their goal at risk.",
        "49": "Consider the long-term implications of contributions: Balance contributions between the current round and future rounds. Avoid contributing too many tokens in one round, which could limit future contributions, and contributing too few tokens, which may result in smaller overall payoffs.",
        "50": "Keep track of other players' average contributions: Player_3 can calculate the average number of tokens contributed by each player in the previous rounds and use this information to make informed decisions about their own contributions in future rounds.",
        "51": "Adjust contributions based on cooperation or competition: Player_3 can also consider cooperating or competing with other players based on their contribution patterns. For example, if player_1 and player_2 consistently contribute similar amounts, player_3 might aim to contribute more tokens to outcompete them for a larger share of the public good payoff. Alternatively, if player_5 consistently contributes fewer tokens, player_3 might aim to cooperate with them by contributing fewer tokens as well to ensure a larger share of the public good payoff for both players.",
        "52": "Consider the impact of timing: Player_3 might consider the timing of their contributions in relation to other players. For example, contributing early in the game might allow player_3 to build a larger stockpile of tokens, while contributing late in the game might result in larger gains from the public pot.",
        "53": "Consider the impact of risk: Player_3 might consider the level of risk they are willing to take in the game. For example, they might aim to contribute a consistent number of tokens each round in order to minimize risk, or they might take risks by contributing fewer tokens in some rounds and more tokens in others in order to potentially gain larger payoffs.",
        "54": "Consider the impact of learning: Player_3 might consider the learning dynamics of the game and adjust their strategy accordingly. For example, they might observe that other players are adjusting their strategies based on the game log, and adjust their own strategy accordingly in order to stay competitive.",
        "55": "Consider the impact of emotions: Player_3 might consider the emotional dynamics of the game and adjust their strategy accordingly. For example, they might observe that other players are becoming frustrated or anxious, and adjust their strategy in order to take advantage of these emotions or build alliances.",
        "56": "Seek information from game rules or previous communication: Check the game manual or any previous discussions with other players for clues about the total number of rounds. Look for any specific mentions of the round limit.",
        "57": "Identify potential sources of information: The player should identify which other players might have information about the total number of rounds. This could be players who have been in the game longer, players who seem to be more experienced, or players who have shown a pattern in their contributions that might indicate they are following a specific strategy based on the number of rounds.",
        "58": "Approach potential sources discreetly: The player should approach potential sources of information discreetly, to avoid alerting other players to their interest in the total number of rounds. They could try to engage them in casual conversation or ask indirect questions to gather information.",
        "59": "Use nonverbal cues: The player could also use nonverbal cues to gather information. For example, they might observe other players' reactions when the game master announces the results of each round, or they might notice patterns in the way other players contribute tokens.",
        "60": "Be prepared for different scenarios: The player should be prepared for different scenarios. For example, they might find out that the game has a fixed number of rounds, or they might not be able to gather any useful information from other players. In either case, they should adjust their strategy accordingly.",
        "61": "Keep track of contributions: The player should keep track of the contributions of other players, as this might provide clues about their strategy and potential knowledge of the total number of rounds. They might also be able to use this information to make informed decisions about their own contributions.",
        "62": "Consider the potential impact on other players: The player should consider the potential impact of their actions on other players. For example, if they gather information about the total number of rounds and use it to their advantage, they might be perceived as unfair or manipulative. They should weigh the potential benefits against the potential costs and make a decision based on their overall goals and values.",
        "63": "Adapt contribution strategy based on uncertainty: If unsure about the total number of rounds, consider contributing a moderate number of tokens in each round to balance the need to accumulate tokens with the need to maintain a safety net for unexpected expenses or changes in game dynamics.",
        "64": "Focus on primary goal and adjust strategy: If the game might continue indefinitely until a certain condition is met, such as accumulating more than 30 tokens, adjust the contribution strategy to align with this primary goal.",
        "65": "Consider time limit and token accumulation: If suspecting a time limit, focus on accumulating as many tokens as possible within the given time frame while still contributing enough to the public pot to maintain a cooperative relationship with other players.",
        "66": "Anticipate changes in the number of rounds: Based on the current state of the game and the behavior of other players, player_3 can make an educated guess about the number of remaining rounds. They can then adjust their strategy to maximize their chances of reaching their goal of more than 30 tokens in the remaining rounds.",
        "67": "Make assumptions and adjust strategy: Based on the available information, make assumptions and adjust the strategy to maximize the chances of achieving the primary goal while maintaining a cooperative relationship with other players.",
        "68": "Maintain a minimum contribution level: Player_3 might aim to maintain a minimum contribution level in each round to ensure they are not falling too far behind other players. For example, they might aim to contribute at least 5 tokens per round to keep up with the other players.",
        "69": "Analyze past payoffs: Player_3 can review their past contributions and payoffs to identify patterns and trends. For instance, they might notice that they receive larger payoffs when contributing fewer tokens, or that they receive smaller payoffs when contributing more tokens.",
        "70": "Set a target payoff: Player_3 can set a target payoff level that they aim to achieve in each round. For example, they might aim for a payoff of 4.0 or higher, and adjust their contribution accordingly.",
        "71": "Adjust contribution gradually: Player_3 should avoid making drastic changes to their contribution level in a single round. Instead, they should aim to adjust their contribution gradually over several rounds to minimize the risk of negative consequences.",
        "72": "Current token distribution: Player_3 can see the tokens held by each player after each round in the game log. Based on this information, they can identify the players with the most tokens at the current stage of the game. In the given log, players with the most tokens after round 18 are player_1 (30.8), player_4 (23.8), and player_5 (20.8).",
        "73": "Trends in token accumulation: Player_3 can also analyze the trend in token accumulation for each player. For instance, they can observe that player_1 has consistently contributed more tokens than the other players and has accumulated the most tokens. Player_4 has also been contributing consistently and has a significant number of tokens. Player_5, on the other hand, has contributed fewer tokens in some rounds but has managed to accumulate a decent number of tokens.",
        "74": "Avoid reacting to other players' contributions: Player_3 could aim to ignore the contributions of other players and focus solely on their own strategy. This could help prevent player_3 from becoming overly concerned with the actions of others and potentially making decisions based on short-term gains.",
        "75": "Avoid making emotional decisions: Player_3 could aim to avoid making decisions based on emotions, such as anger or frustration, and instead focus on a rational analysis of the situation. This could help prevent player_3 from making impulsive decisions that could harm their long-term goal.",
        "76": "Determine an optimal contribution level: Player_3 could analyze the past contributions of other players and the resulting public pot sizes to determine an optimal contribution level that would help them maintain a consistent strategy while also contributing to the growth of the public pot. For example, they could aim to contribute a certain percentage of their total tokens in each round, or a fixed number of tokens.",
        "77": "Reach 25 tokens by the end of the next 2-3 rounds: Given that player_3 currently has 23.8 tokens and the public pot is contributing an average of around 5.5 tokens per round, player_3 could aim to contribute around 6 tokens per round to reach their intermediate goal of 25 tokens by the end of the next 2-3 rounds.",
        "78": "Consider the potential impact of contributing fewer tokens in the current round: If player_3 decides to contribute fewer tokens to the public pot, the overall size of the pot will be smaller, resulting in a smaller payoff for all players. However, player_3 will retain more tokens for future rounds, potentially increasing their chances of reaching more than 30 tokens.",
        "79": "Consider the potential impact of external factors: Player_3 should also consider any external factors that might affect their contributions or the overall outcome of the game, such as changes in the game rules, unexpected expenses, or unforeseen events. They might need to adjust their strategy accordingly to maximize their chances of reaching more than 30 tokens.",
        "80": "Consider the potential impact of cooperation with other players: Consider the potential impact of cooperating with other players on the overall outcome of the game. For example, contributing more tokens to the public pot in some rounds to help increase the overall size of the pot and potentially earn larger payoffs for all players involved could lead to a better overall outcome for the group, but it could also potentially put you at risk of not reaching your goal of more than 30 tokens by the end of the game if other players do not contribute their fair share. Conversely, contributing fewer tokens to the public pot in some rounds to retain more tokens for future rounds could help ensure that you reach your goal of more than 30 tokens by the end of the game, but it could also potentially result in smaller payoffs for all players involved and potentially harm the overall cooperation and coordination within the group.",
        "81": "Identify trend reversals: Player_3 should look for players whose contribution patterns have changed significantly in recent rounds. For example, a player who previously contributed a large number of tokens suddenly contributing very few tokens could be a sign of a strategy shift or a change in circumstances.",
        "82": "Cooperate with players who have a balanced motivation for both maximizing their overall gain and retaining a reasonable private collection, such as Player_4 and Player_5: Player_3 should consider cooperating with players like Player_4 and Player_5, who have a balanced motivation for maximizing their overall gain and retaining a reasonable private collection, as this could lead to fair outcomes for all players involved.",
        "83": "Retain a reasonable private collection to ensure a safety net for unexpected expenses or lower contributions in some rounds: Player_3 should aim to retain a reasonable private collection to provide a safety net for unexpected expenses or lower contributions in certain rounds.",
        "84": "Gathering information about other players' strategies: Player_3 could aim to gather information about other players' contribution patterns, such as whether they tend to contribute more or less tokens in certain rounds or under specific circumstances. This information could help player_3 adjust their own strategy and anticipate other players' moves.",
        "85": "Identifying other players' motivations: Player_3 could aim to identify other players' motivations, such as whether they prioritize maximizing their own gains or contributing to the public pot. This information could help player_3 determine whether to cooperate or compete with other players and adjust their communication accordingly.",
        "86": "Building alliances: Player_3 could aim to build alliances with other players who share similar goals or strategies. By communicating effectively and coordinating contributions, player_3 and their allies could potentially increase their overall gains and influence the outcome of the game.",
        "87": "Misdirecting other players: Player_3 could aim to misdirect other players by communicating false information or feigning certain behaviors. For example, player_3 could pretend to contribute more tokens than they actually do, in order to encourage other players to contribute less and leave more tokens in the public pot for player_3 to gain from.",
        "88": "Consider the long-term implications of contributions: Player_3 should consider the long-term implications of their contributions, such as the impact on their reputation and relationships with other players.",
        "89": "Consider the potential for randomness: Player_3 should consider the potential for randomness in the game and adjust their contributions accordingly.",
        "90": "Consider the potential for learning: Player_3 should consider the potential for learning from the game and using that knowledge to improve their strategy in future rounds.",
        "91": "Evaluate emergency funds: Player_3 should also consider their emergency funds and ensure they have enough tokens set aside for unexpected expenses. If they have a sufficient emergency fund, they may be able to contribute less to the pot.",
        "92": "Consider potential future rounds: Player_3 should also consider the potential number of rounds remaining in the game and the size of the pot. If they believe the pot will be large enough to provide a significant gain in the remaining rounds, they may be able to afford contributing less to the pot.",
        "93": "Consider the impact on overall group payoff: Player_3 should also consider the impact of their contribution on the overall group payoff. If their contribution significantly affects the group payoff, they might consider contributing a larger percentage in the later rounds to maximize the overall group benefit.",
        "94": "Maintain a minimum personal token balance: Player_3 can aim to maintain a minimum personal token balance to ensure they have enough tokens for personal use or emergencies. For example, they might aim to retain at least 10 tokens at all times.",
        "95": "Consider verbal or nonverbal communication: Player_3 might consider using verbal or nonverbal communication to coordinate contributions with other players. For example, they might agree to contribute a certain number of tokens in each round or signal their intentions through body language or other subtle cues.",
        "96": "Stay informed: Player_3 should stay informed about the overall state of the game and any changes that occur. This could include keeping track of the size of the public pot, the contributions of other players, and any unexpected developments that might affect the game's outcome.",
        "97": "Building alliances: The player aims to build alliances with other players, either through verbal or nonverbal communication, to coordinate contributions and increase the overall size of the public pot. This could potentially lead to larger payoffs for all players involved."

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Monitor the number of players in each round: Player_4 should keep track of the number of players participating in each round to determine if they need to adjust their contribution accordingly.\n - Use randomness: Player_4 might consider using a random number generator or some other method to determine their contribution amount in each round, to further obscure their strategy.\n - Identify optimal contribution levels: Based on their analysis, Player 4 should aim to identify the optimal contribution level that maximizes their gains. This might involve contributing more tokens in some rounds and fewer tokens in others, depending on the behavior of other players and the size of the public pot.\n - Analyze the relationship between tokens contributed and personal gain: Player_4 should examine the correlation between the number of tokens contributed in each round and their resulting gain. If they notice that contributing more tokens leads to a larger gain, they might consider contributing more tokens in future rounds. Conversely, if they notice that contributing fewer tokens leads to a larger gain, they might consider contributing fewer tokens in future rounds.\n - Keep a record of the game results and personal gains: Player_4 should keep a record of the game results and personal gains to track progress towards the primary goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens by the end of the game.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

        "41": "Building alliances: Player_4 could try to build alliances with other players who are willing to contribute different numbers of tokens in each round. This could involve coordinating contributions with those players to create more variation in the overall distribution of tokens.",
        "42": "Encouraging experimentation: Player_4 could encourage other players to experiment with different contribution strategies by sharing information about the potential benefits and risks of different approaches. This could help to create a more dynamic and unpredictable game environment, which could lead to larger overall payoffs for all players.",
        "43": "Build relationships with multiple players: Player_4 should aim to build relationships with multiple players, rather than relying too heavily on any one alliance. This can help to ensure that player_4 has multiple sources of support and can adapt to changing contribution patterns.",
        "44": "Consider the potential impact of alliances: Player 4 should weigh the potential benefits of building alliances against the need to maintain a safety net. If Player 4 believes that building alliances with other players will lead to larger public pots and greater overall gains, they may need to sacrifice some of their safety net to contribute more tokens to the public pot. Conversely, if Player 4 believes that other players are not cooperating and the public pots are likely to be small, they may need to prioritize building their safety net over building alliances.",
        "45": "Communicate with other players: If player_4 believes that communication with other players could help improve the overall outcome of the game, they might consider discussing their strategies and adjusting their contributions accordingly. However, they should be careful not to reveal too much information about their own contributions or goals.",
        "46": "Maintain a safety net: Player_4 should aim to maintain a certain number of tokens in their private collection as a safety net, in case they need to make up for lower contributions in some rounds or unexpected expenses. This could help them stay flexible and adapt to changes in the game more effectively.",

They may choose to communicate openly about their concerns and try to build trust and cooperation among the players.",
        "49": "Monitor current contributions: Player_4 can keep track of the current contributions of each player in real-time and adjust their strategy accordingly. For example, if they notice that a player is contributing fewer tokens than usual, they might decide to contribute more in that round to build a larger safety net.",
        "50": "Adjust contributions based on game dynamics: Player_4 might also adjust their contributions based on the overall dynamics of the game. For example, they might contribute more tokens in rounds where they believe other players are more likely to contribute fewer tokens, or they might contribute fewer tokens in rounds where they believe other players are more likely to contribute more.",
        "51": "Collaborate with other players: Player_4 could consider collaborating with other players to address any perceived free-riding behavior. This could involve discussing the issue with the other players directly, or working together to develop strategies for encouraging greater contributions from all players.",
        "52": "Monitor other players' contributions: Keep track of the number of tokens contributed by each player in each round to identify any patterns of undercontribution.",
        "53": "Consider the potential reasons for undercontribution: Player_4 can consider the potential reasons for undercontribution by other players, such as strategic decision-making or lack of resources. Understanding the reasons for undercontribution can help player_4 adjust their own strategy and potentially mitigate the negative impact on the public pot.",
        "54": "Communicate with other players: Consider communicating with other players to encourage greater cooperation and coordination of contributions. This could involve verbal or nonverbal communication, such as making eye contact or using gestures to signal intentions.",
        "55": "Consider the long-term impact of contributions: Consider the long-term impact of contributions on the overall outcome of the game. For example, if player_4 believes that greater cooperation among all players will lead to larger payoffs in the long run, they might be willing to make short-term sacrifices to encourage greater cooperation.",
        "56": "Maintain a balance between cooperation and self-interest: Balance the desire to cooperate with other players and the need to accumulate enough tokens to reach the goal of 30 or more by the end of the game. This might involve making strategic contributions that benefit both the group and the individual player.",
        "57": "Maintain a long-term perspective: It's important for player_4 to maintain a long-term perspective when identifying patterns of free-riding behavior. Free-riding may not always be a consistent pattern, and it's possible that other players may contribute more in future rounds. By maintaining a long-term perspective, player_4 can avoid making hasty judgments and focus on building a sustainable strategy for maximizing the overall size of the public pot.",
        "58": "Consider the possibility of cooperation: Player_4 may also consider the possibility of cooperating with other players to build alliances and coordinate contributions to increase the overall size of the public pot and potentially achieve better outcomes for all players involved.",
        "59": "Consider the impact of external factors: Player_4 should consider the impact of external factors on their contribution strategy, such as changes in the game rules, unexpected expenses, or changes in the behavior of other players. They may need to adjust their strategy accordingly to ensure they reach their goal while also contributing to the overall size of the public pot.",
        "60": "Propose a minimum contribution level: Player_4 might propose a minimum contribution level to all players, encouraging them to contribute at least that amount to the public pot. This could potentially lead to a larger payout for everyone, as the public good payoff will be larger when more tokens are contributed to the pot.",
        "61": "Share information selectively: Player_4 should be careful not to reveal too much information about their own token collection or goals to other players. They might share information selectively, only revealing enough to build trust and coordinate contributions without giving away too much information that could be used against them.",
        "62": "Monitor other players' contributions: Player_4 should continue to monitor other players' contributions and adjust their own strategy accordingly. They might need to adapt their communication strategy if other players are not cooperating or if they are contributing too little to the public pot.",
        "63": "Communicating openly and honestly: Player_4 might aim to communicate openly and honestly with other players about their contribution decisions and reasoning. This could help to build transparency and understanding within the group, which could lead to more effective cooperation and trust-building.",
        "64": "Maintaining a positive attitude: Player_4 might aim to maintain a positive and supportive attitude towards other players, even when they make decisions that are not in line with the group's overall goals. This could help to create a more cooperative and productive game environment, where all players feel valued and respected.",
        "65": "Calculate average contribution: Player_4 should calculate their average contribution per round by summing up their total tokens contributed and dividing by the number of rounds played so far. For example, their average contribution after round 4 would be (7+5+4+1)/4 = 4.5 tokens per round.",
        "66": "Consider unexpected expenses: Player_4 might aim to set aside a portion of their safety net for unexpected expenses. For example, they might allocate 1 or 2 tokens per round to a 'rainy day fund' to cover unexpected costs or contributions in future rounds.",
        "67": "Consider the reasons for other players' contributions: Player_4 should try to understand the reasons behind other players' contributions. For example, if Player_1 is contributing more tokens because they are trying to reach a personal goal, Player_4 might choose to cooperate and contribute less to help Player_1 reach their goal.",
        "68": "Keep a record: Player_4 should keep a record of other players' contributions and their own contributions for future reference. This information can help player_4 make more informed decisions in future rounds and improve their overall strategy.",
        "69": "Consider the overall distribution of tokens: Player_4 should also consider the overall distribution of tokens among the players after each round. If they notice that some players have significantly more tokens than others, they might choose to contribute more to the public pot in order to help balance things out and benefit the group as a whole.",
        "70": "Consider the impact of randomness: Player 4 should also consider the impact of randomness on the game, as the size of the public pot is determined by the combined contributions of all players and is multiplied by a factor of 2. This means that there is an element of unpredictability to the game, and Player 4 may need to be flexible in their strategy in order to adapt to unexpected outcomes.",
        "71": "Anticipating potential strategies: Player_4 should anticipate potential strategies of other players and adjust their own strategy accordingly. For example, they might assume that other players will aim to contribute more in certain rounds and adjust their contributions accordingly to maximize their own gain.",
        "72": "Adapting to changing circumstances: Player_4 should be prepared to adapt their contribution strategy in response to changing circumstances, such as unexpected changes in other players' behaviors or changes in the overall distribution of tokens.",
        "73": "Consistent contribution: Player_4 might aim to contribute a consistent number of tokens to the public pot in each round, regardless of the contributions of other players. This demonstrates reliability and trustworthiness, which are important components of building long-term relationships.",
        "74": "Flexibility: Player_4 might aim to be flexible in their contribution strategy, adjusting it based on the contributions of other players and the overall distribution of tokens in the public pot. This demonstrates adaptability and a willingness to work with others to achieve the best possible outcome for the group.",
        "75": "Patience: Player_4 might aim to be patient and focus on the long-term benefits of building relationships, rather than being overly focused on short-term gains. This means resisting the temptation to contribute less in rounds where other players contribute more, and instead focusing on the potential benefits of cooperation and trust-building in the future.",
        "76": "Adjust contribution strategy based on empathy: Player_4 can use their empathy to adjust their contribution strategy to better align with the needs and motivations of other players. For example, if they sense that another player is struggling financially, they might contribute more tokens to the public pot to help that player out.",
        "77": "Practice active listening: Player_4 can practice active listening during conversations with other players to better understand their perspectives and motivations. For example, they might ask clarifying questions or summarize what they have heard to ensure that they have a clear understanding of the other player's point of view.",
        "78": "Avoid making assumptions: Player_4 should avoid making assumptions about other players based on limited information. Instead, they should strive to gather as much information as possible before making decisions and should be open to revising their assumptions as new information becomes available.",
        "79": "Reciprocity: Player_4 might aim to reciprocate the contributions of other players, either by contributing more in rounds where other players contribute more, or by offering other forms of support or assistance. This demonstrates a willingness to give and take, which is an important component of building long-term relationships.",
        "80": "Consider the impact of the public pot size on individual gains: Player_4 can also consider the impact of the size of the public pot on individual gains. For example, if the public pot is large, player_4 might choose to contribute fewer tokens in order to maximize their own gain, while if the public pot is small, player_4 might choose to contribute more in order to increase the size of the pot and potentially increase their gain as well.",
        "81": "Identify patterns in other players' contributions: Player_4 can look for patterns in other players' contributions, such as consistent high or low contributions, and adjust their own strategy accordingly.",
        "82": "Use communication to gather information: Player_4 can use verbal or nonverbal communication with other players to gather information about their contribution strategies and adjust their own strategy accordingly.",
        "83": "Monitor current contributions: Player_4 should also monitor the contributions of these potential alliance partners in the current round and future rounds. If they continue to contribute significantly to the public pot, it may indicate a willingness to cooperate and build alliances.",
        "84": "Communicate with potential alliance partners: Player_4 could try to communicate with potential alliance partners to discuss their strategies and coordinate contributions. This could be done through verbal communication during the game or nonverbal communication, such as consistent contribution patterns.",
        "85": "Adjust contribution strategy based on alliance status: Player_4 should adjust their contribution strategy based on the status of their alliances. For example, if they have formed a strong alliance with another player, they might contribute more tokens to the public pot in rounds where their alliance partner contributes less, to help maintain a consistent flow of tokens to the pot.",
        "86": "Be flexible and adaptable: Building alliances requires flexibility and adaptability. Player_4 should be prepared to adjust their strategy if their alliance partners change their contribution patterns or if new potential alliance partners emerge."
