(Minimum contribution MAY BE necessary for future token accumulation.)\n2. Contributing a moderate number of tokens may lead to a larger public good payoff and a larger individual gain, but it also means a smaller share of tokens for future rounds. (Moderate contribution SHOULD BE considered based on the expected future gains.)\n3. Contributing a large number of tokens in one round may lead to a larger individual gain in that round but may result in fewer tokens for future rounds. (Large contribution DOES NOT contribute to long-term token accumulation without careful consideration.)\n4. The optimal contribution strategy depends on the expected future gains and the current state of tokens in the game.
