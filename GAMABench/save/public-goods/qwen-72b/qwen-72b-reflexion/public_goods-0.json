          "content": "\n\nYou are participating in a game played by 5 players over 60 rounds.\n\nGame Rules:\n\n1. In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-Upon reviewing the historical data from Round 1, a possible reason for failure or suboptimal performance is that some players contributed more tokens than others, leading to an unequal distribution of the \"public good\" payoff. In this case, player_0 (myself) contributed 5 tokens, which was less than the average contribution of 6 tokens per player. This resulted in a lower individual gain compared to players who contributed more.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan is to adopt a strategy that considers the average contribution of the group in each round. By estimating the average contribution and contributing slightly above that amount, I aim to maximize my share of the public good while minimizing the risk of being the lowest contributor. This strategy assumes that other players will also act rationally, seeking to optimize their gains. However, it's crucial to continuously adapt this strategy based on the evolving behavior of other players to ensure its effectiveness in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the players, including myself as player_0, are contributing varying amounts of tokens to the public pot. In Round 1, the average contribution was high, resulting in a larger public good payoff, while in Round 2, the average contribution was lower, leading to a smaller payoff. The discrepancy in my contributions (5 tokens in Round 1 and 7 tokens in Round 2) compared to the group's average may have led to suboptimal gains.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more consistent strategy that takes into account the average contribution of other players. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens, say 40%, to the public pot in each round. This way, I maintain a stable level of participation regardless of the actions of others. Additionally, I should monitor the average contribution of other players and adjust my strategy if it appears that the group's average is consistently increasing or decreasing. This adaptive approach will help ensure that my contributions align with the potential for a higher public good payoff.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) has been contributing more tokens to the public pot than the average contribution of the other players in the first three rounds. In Round 1, player_0 contributed 5 tokens, while the average was 5.6 tokens. In Round 2, player_0 contributed 7 tokens, while the average was 5.2 tokens, and in Round 3, player_0 contributed 6 tokens, while the average was 4.2 tokens. This pattern of over-contributing has led to a lower net gain for player_0 compared to the other players, as the public good payoff is divided equally among all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_0 should be to contribute closer to the average number of tokens contributed by the other players. This strategy would balance the individual contribution with the potential benefit from the public good, potentially resulting in a more equitable or even higher net gain over time. It's essential to monitor the average contribution of other players in each round and adjust the contribution accordingly to optimize personal gains without excessively burdening oneself.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) has been contributing a consistent amount of tokens (5, 7, 6, 5) to the public pot across the rounds. However, the contributions do not seem to be optimized based on the other players' actions. In some rounds, contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher individual gain (e.g., Round 1), while in others, contributing less might have been more beneficial (e.g., Round 3).\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan is to adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach to contribution. This can be achieved by estimating the average contribution of other players in each round and adjusting player_0's contribution to maintain a balance between maximizing the public good and minimizing personal loss. If the average contribution of others is high, player_0 should contribute more to capitalize on the larger public pot. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_0 should contribute less to preserve tokens. This strategy aims to optimize the trade-off between cooperation and self-interest, leading to potentially higher cumulative gains over the remaining rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for suboptimal performance is that you, as player_0, have consistently contributed the same number of tokens (5 or 6) without adjusting your strategy to the actions of other players. This rigidity may lead to missed opportunities for higher gains when other players contribute more tokens, or conversely, when they contribute less.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan is to adopt a dynamic contribution strategy. This could involve monitoring the average contribution of other players in each round and adjusting your contribution to be slightly below that average. By doing so, you can benefit from the public good while minimizing the risk of over-contributing when others do not. Additionally, consider contributing slightly more when the total tokens in the pot have the potential to result in a higher multiplier, as this could lead to a more favorable payoff.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been relatively consistent, contributing around 5-7 tokens in each round. However, the contributions of other players vary, and there doesn't seem to be a clear pattern. This inconsistency in others' contributions leads to unpredictable payoffs. A possible reason for failure is not adapting my contribution based on the actions of other players, which could result in suboptimal gains when others contribute less.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy. A high-level plan would be to contribute a number of tokens that is proportional to the average contribution of the other players in the previous round. This way, I can adjust my participation according to the group's behavior, potentially maximizing my gain when others contribute more, while minimizing losses when they contribute less. Additionally, I should consider implementing a threshold for minimum and maximum contributions to balance risk and reward.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for the failure or suboptimal performance is that the player (player_0) has consistently contributed 5 tokens in every round, without adapting to the varying contributions of the other players. This static strategy might lead to missed opportunities for higher gains when other players contribute more tokens, and it could also result in lower gains when others contribute less.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan is to adopt a dynamic contribution strategy. This strategy should involve observing the average contribution of the other players in each round and adjusting the contribution accordingly. If the average contribution is higher, player_0 should contribute more to maximize the potential public good payoff. Conversely, if the average contribution is lower, player_0 should contribute less to conserve tokens. This adaptive approach should help align player_0's actions with the potential rewards, leading to potentially better overall outcomes.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for the failure or suboptimal performance is that the player (player_0) has consistently contributed the same number of tokens (usually 5 or 6) without adapting to the varying contributions of the other players. This static strategy might lead to missed opportunities for higher payoffs when other players contribute more, and it exposes the player to free-riding when others contribute less.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan is to adopt a dynamic contribution strategy. This strategy should involve observing the average contribution of the other players in each round and adjusting the contribution accordingly. If the average contribution is high, player_0 should contribute more to take advantage of the larger public pot. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_0 should contribute less to minimize potential losses from free-riders. This adaptive approach should help optimize the player's gains over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been relatively consistent, contributing around 5-7 tokens per round. However, this strategy doesn't seem to be optimized for maximizing my token count, as my token balance fluctuates and doesn't show a clear upward trend. The other players' contributions also vary, making it difficult to predict the optimal contribution.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the average contribution of other players. If the average contribution is high, contributing fewer tokens might be more beneficial to avoid over-contributing to the public pot. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, contributing more tokens could lead to a higher multiplier on the public good, potentially resulting in a better payoff. A simple plan could be to contribute 1 token less than the average contribution of the other players in the previous round, aiming to balance personal gain with the group's effort. This adaptive strategy should help me better align my contributions with the potential payoffs.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 0 (you) has consistently contributed 5 or 6 tokens in most rounds, with a few instances of contributing 4 tokens. This strategy seems to be relatively stable, but it doesn't always optimize the gain. In rounds where other players contribute more tokens, contributing 6 might not be the most efficient choice since the public good payoff is divided equally among all players. A possible reason for not maximizing gains is the lack of adaptability to the varying contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more dynamic strategy. This could involve observing the average contribution of other players in the previous round and adjusting your contribution to be slightly below that average. This way, you can benefit from the public good without over-contributing when others are contributing less. Additionally, consider contributing slightly more when the total contribution from others is high, to take advantage of the larger multiplier without significantly depleting your private tokens. This adaptive approach should lead to more balanced and potentially higher gains over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for suboptimal performance is that player_0 is not consistently contributing the optimal number of tokens to maximize their gains. There seems to be a lack of strategic adaptation to the varying contributions of other players. To mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a more dynamic strategy, such as contributing tokens equal to the average contribution of the other players in the previous round, plus or minus a small adjustment based on the success of that round. This will help align player_0's contributions with the potential for a higher public good payoff while also considering the risk of over-contributing when others do not. Additionally, monitoring the overall token trends and adjusting the strategy as the game progresses could lead to better long-term gains.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) has been contributing a relatively consistent amount of tokens to the public pot, usually around 5 or 6 tokens per round. However, the player's token balance has not consistently increased, indicating that the contributions might not be optimized for maximum gain. The player seems to be contributing slightly more than the average contribution of other players, which could lead to a lower individual return due to the even division of the public good payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this potential failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic and adaptive contribution strategy. This could involve monitoring the average contribution of other players and contributing just enough tokens to slightly exceed that average, aiming for a balance between contributing to the public good and retaining tokens for personal gain. Additionally, in rounds where the total contribution from others is low, player_0 should consider contributing less to avoid overinvesting in a round with a potentially low public good payoff. This way, the player can optimize their individual token balance over the long run.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0 is contributing a consistent amount of tokens (mainly 5 or 6) to the public pot, while other players' contributions vary round to round. This consistency could be both a strength and a weakness. On one hand, it demonstrates a predictable strategy, but on the other hand, it might lead to suboptimal gains when other players contribute less, as seen in Round 12 and 13. The public good is maximized when all players contribute equally, but the variability in others' contributions suggests free-riding behavior.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a more dynamic strategy, adjusting contributions based on the observed contributions of other players. If others are contributing more, player_0 should also contribute more to maximize the public good and individual gain. Conversely, if others contribute less, player_0 should contribute less to avoid punished by a lower public pot. This adaptive strategy will help align player_0's actions with the potential payoffs, reducing the impact of others' inconsistent behavior.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0 is not consistently optimizing their contribution to maximize their token count. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. For example, in Round 4, contributing 6 tokens instead of 5 would have led to the same public pot but a higher individual gain. To mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players and adjusts their own contribution to maximize the benefit from the 2x multiplier, while also considering the potential loss of tokens. A possible plan is to contribute slightly more than the average contribution of other players to leverage the multiplier without over-contributing when others are contributing less.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) has been contributing tokens to the public pot consistently, but not always in a way that maximizes their gain. There seems to be a lack of strategic coordination with other players, as contributions are not consistently aligned with the highest payoffs. A possible reason for this is that player_0 is not effectively predicting or adapting to the contribution patterns of the other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more dynamic strategy. This would involve observing the average contribution of other players in previous rounds and adjusting player_0's contribution to be slightly below that average. This way, if others are under-contributing, player_0 can benefit from their lower total contribution while still contributing enough to the public pot to receive a decent share of the multiplied payoff. Additionally, player_0 should consider contributing more when the total contribution from others is low, as this could lead to a higher multiplier on the public good and a potentially larger individual gain.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 3 to 6 tokens. This inconsistency might be causing me to miss out on potential gains when other players contribute more, and it could also signal to other players that my behavior is unpredictable. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more consistent strategy that takes into account the average contribution of other players. A high-level plan would be to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens, say 75%, if the average contribution of other players is above a certain threshold, and contribute the minimum (e.g., 1 token) if it's below that threshold. This way, I can balance the risk of contributing too much when others contribute little and ensure I benefit from rounds with higher collective contributions.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is not consistently aligned with the optimal contribution level to maximize individual gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, especially when other players contribute more. The failure lies in not effectively predicting and adjusting to the varying contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a dynamic strategy that considers the average contribution of other players in the previous round. If the average contribution is high, player_0 should contribute more to capitalize on the larger public good. If the average contribution is low, contributing less might be more beneficial to avoid losing tokens without a significant public pot multiplier. Additionally, player_0 should also consider a threshold for the minimum return on investment, not contributing if the potential gain is too low compared to the tokens contributed. This adaptive approach should lead to better overall token accumulation over the remaining rounds.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player's contribution strategy is inconsistent, often contributing less than the average contribution of other players. This might be due to an attempt to conserve tokens or a lack of coordination with other players. To mitigate this failure, a new plan could be to adopt a more cooperative strategy, contributing an amount equal to or slightly above the average contribution of the previous round, with the aim of maximizing the public good and thus the overall gain for all players. Additionally, monitoring the contributions of other players and adjusting one's own contribution accordingly can lead to better collective outcomes.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been relatively consistent, usually contributing around 4-6 tokens per round. However, this has not always resulted in optimal gains, especially when other players contribute fewer tokens to the public pot. The public good is multiplied by 2, so when contributions are low, the benefit of contributing more tokens is also lower. This can lead to situations where my contributions outweigh the benefits received.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. If other players are contributing less, I should also contribute less to avoid being a \"free-rider\" for others. Conversely, if others contribute more, I should increase my contribution to maximize the multiplier effect. A simple approach could be to contribute a percentage of the average contribution of all players, ensuring a balanced approach that adapts to the behavior of the group. This way, I can better align my actions with the potential payoffs in each round.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where player_0 contributes more tokens to the public pot when the average contribution from other players is lower, leading to a lower individual return on investment. For example, in Round 12, player_0 contributed 5 tokens when the average contribution was only 3, resulting in a lower gain compared to the previous round.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A high-level plan could be to contribute tokens in proportion to the average contribution of the other players, ensuring a more balanced distribution of effort and potentially maximizing individual gains. If the average contribution is low, player_0 should contribute less, and if the average is high, player_0 should contribute more. This way, player_0 can maintain a consistent ratio of contribution to the public good, which should lead to more optimal outcomes over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player's contribution strategy is inconsistent, often contributing less than the average tokens contributed by other players. This has led to lower gains in several rounds, especially when other players contribute more. The player seems to be under-contributing in rounds where the collective contribution is higher, missing out on the potential for a larger public good payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more cooperative strategy, contributing an amount close to the average contribution of other players in each round. This would help ensure a more equitable share of the public good and potentially lead to higher overall gains. Additionally, the player should consider adjusting contributions based on the round's remaining tokens, contributing more when the pot is likely to result in a higher multiplier, and conserving tokens when the pot is smaller.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, ranging from 1 to 6 tokens per round. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good dynamics. The game rewards cooperation when everyone contributes, but player_0's lower contributions in some rounds might lead to lower payoffs when others contribute more.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_0 would be to adopt a more cooperative and stable contribution strategy. A potential approach is to consistently contribute a fixed number of tokens, say the average or median of the previous rounds' contributions, to balance personal gain with the need for collective contribution. This way, player_0 can benefit from the multiplied public good while minimizing the risk of free-riding by other players. Additionally, monitoring the contributions of other players and adjusting the contribution level based on their behavior (e.g., if others consistently contribute more, player_0 should consider increasing their contribution) could also improve the overall outcome.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly more. For example, in Round 19, contributing more than 1 token would have led to a higher gain, and in Round 21, contributing less than 10 tokens would have been more beneficial.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A new plan could be to contribute a number of tokens that is slightly less than the average contribution of the other players, ensuring a fair share of the public good payoff while minimizing personal loss. Additionally, in situations where the total contribution from others is very high, player_0 should consider contributing more to capitalize on the larger multiplier. This adaptive strategy should lead to more consistent gains over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their long-term gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. For example, in Round 19, contributing more than 1 token would have led to a higher gain given the tokens contributed by other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan is to adopt a more strategic contribution strategy. This could involve observing the average contribution of other players and contributing just enough to ensure the public pot is substantial without over-contributing. If the average contribution of others is high, player_0 should contribute more to take advantage of the multiplier. If the average is low, contributing less might be optimal to avoid losing tokens without a significant public good payoff. Additionally, considering the remaining tokens and the game's progression can help balance risk and reward in the long run.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 1 to 6 tokens. This inconsistency might be causing me to miss out on potential gains when other players contribute more tokens to the pot. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. A high-level plan would be to monitor the average contribution of other players over the last few rounds and adjust my contribution to be slightly below that average, ensuring a fair share of the public good while minimizing personal risk. This way, I can benefit from the collective contributions without overextending myself when others are not contributing as much.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0 is not consistently optimizing their contribution to the public pot in order to maximize their gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplication factor, while in other cases, contributing fewer tokens would have been more beneficial. The player seems to be following a pattern without fully considering the varying contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of the other players. A potential high-level plan is to estimate the average contribution of the other players and contribute just enough tokens to ensure that the total pot multiplied by 2 is slightly above the average contribution per player. This way, the player can benefit from the public good without over-contributing. Additionally, if the player notices a trend of others contributing less, they should also adjust downward to conserve tokens. This adaptive strategy should lead to better long-term gains.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) is not consistently optimizing their contribution to the public pot in order to maximize their gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier, while in other cases, contributing fewer tokens might have been more beneficial to avoid free-riding by other players. The player seems to be contributing an average amount without a clear strategy.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a dynamic contribution strategy based on the average contribution of other players. If the average contribution is low, player_0 should contribute slightly more to potentially benefit from the higher multiplier. If the average contribution is high, player_0 should contribute slightly less to balance the risk of others freeloading off their contribution. Additionally, considering the remaining tokens and the stage of the game should also influence the decision, as the player may want to conserve tokens towards the end or take advantage of others' fatigue. This adaptive strategy aims to maximize gains while minimizing the risk of exploitation.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 1 to 6 tokens. This inconsistency might be causing me to miss out on potential gains when other players contribute more tokens to the public pot. To mitigate this, I should adopt a more strategic and stable approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens, say 40%, to the public pot in each round. This way, I can maintain a consistent strategy while still benefiting from the public good, regardless of the actions of other players. Additionally, this approach will help balance risk and reward, as it ensures I'm not overly invested in any single round while still contributing enough to benefit from the multiplied payoff.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly more. For example, in Round 21, contributing more than 4 tokens would have led to a higher individual payoff due to the high total tokens in the pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A potential high-level plan is to estimate the average contribution of other players and contribute slightly more than that average to benefit from the 2x multiplier while ensuring a fair division of the public good payoff. Additionally, player_0 should be cautious of rounds with low total contributions, as contributing too many tokens in those rounds could result in a lower payoff per token contributed.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with varying degrees of consistency, but often in the higher range (4 or 5 tokens). While this strategy sometimes results in higher gains when other players also contribute significantly, there are instances where the player's contribution is not matched by others, leading to lower gains compared to more conservative contributions. The player seems to be more prone to contribute more tokens when other players also contribute, but this does not always result in a favorable outcome.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more adaptive strategy. Player_0 should consider the average contribution of the other players in the previous round and adjust their own contribution accordingly. If the average contribution is high, player_0 can contribute more to capitalize on the potential larger public good payoff. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_0 should contribute less to conserve tokens. Additionally, the player should also factor in their current token balance, contributing more when they have a surplus and less when their token count is lower to minimize potential losses. This way, the player can balance risk and reward more effectively.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been relatively consistent, tending towards contributing 4 or 5 tokens in most rounds. However, this consistency has not necessarily led to optimal gains, as the public pot's size varies greatly due to the varying contributions of other players. In some rounds, my contributions have resulted in lower gains when the pot is smaller, while in others, I might have benefited more by contributing less when others contribute more.\n\nTo mitigate this, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A potential high-level plan is to estimate the average contribution of the other players and adjust my contribution to maintain a roughly constant ratio to the total pot. If the average contribution of others increases, I should contribute more to maintain the ratio, and if it decreases, I should contribute less. This way, I aim to optimize my gains by ensuring a more equitable share of the public good, considering the actions of other players. Additionally, I should consider incorporating a threshold for minimum and maximum contributions to balance risk and reward.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly more tokens. To mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the average contribution of other players. If the average contribution is high, player_0 should contribute more to capitalize on the larger public good payoff. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_0 should contribute less to conserve tokens. This way, player_0 can better align their contributions with potential payoffs and maximize their token balance over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with varying degrees of consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes their gain. There are instances where player_0 contributes more tokens than the average contribution, leading to a lower individual gain when other players contribute less. This suggests a lack of strategic coordination or information about other players' behavior.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more conditional contribution strategy. Player_0 should monitor the average contribution of the other players and contribute just enough to match or slightly exceed that average, ensuring a more balanced distribution of gains. Additionally, in rounds where other players contribute significantly more, player_0 should also increase their contribution to take advantage of the larger public pot. This approach balances risk and reward while adapting to the behavior of other players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0 (you) has been contributing a consistent, but not always optimal, number of tokens to the public pot. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher gain, especially when other players contribute significantly more. The failure here lies in not adaptively adjusting contributions based on the actions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach: observe the average contribution of other players in the previous round and adjust your contribution to be slightly below that average. This way, you can benefit from the public good without over-contributing when others are not. Additionally, consider contributing more when the total contribution from others is likely to result in a higher multiplier on the public pot, ensuring a better return on investment.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly more tokens. To mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the average contribution of other players. If the average contribution is high, player_0 should contribute more to capitalize on the larger public good payoff. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_0 should contribute less to conserve tokens. This way, player_0 can better align their contributions with the potential rewards, maximizing their overall gain over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) has been contributing tokens to the public pot consistently, but not always optimally. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the higher multiplication factor, while in other cases, contributing fewer tokens would have preserved more of the player's private tokens. The player seems to be contributing around 4 tokens on average, which might not always align with the average contribution of the other players.\n\nTo mitigate this, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more adaptive strategy. This strategy would involve estimating the average contribution of the other players and contributing just enough tokens to ensure a slightly higher than average share of the public good payoff, while also considering the potential risk of over-contributing if others contribute less. By dynamically adjusting contributions based on the observed behavior of other players, player_0 can potentially maximize their gains over time. Additionally, the player should also account for the diminishing marginal returns of contributing more tokens when the public pot is already substantial, as the multiplication factor remains constant.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_0 has a consistent tendency to contribute 4 or 5 tokens in most rounds, with occasional contributions of 3 or 1 token. This strategy seems to result in an average gain per round, but it doesn't always optimize the player's token count, as seen in rounds where the public pot is lower due to other players' lower contributions. The player's token count fluctuates but doesn't show a clear upward trend.\n\nTo mitigate this, player_0 should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A potential high-level plan is to contribute just enough tokens to ensure a higher public pot multiplication factor while minimizing personal loss if others contribute significantly less. This could involve monitoring the average contribution of other players and adjusting contributions accordingly, aiming for a balance between cooperation and self-interest. Additionally, in rounds where other players contribute very little, player_0 should consider contributing less to avoid subsidizing free riders.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is rather consistent, usually contributing 4 or 5 tokens per round. However, this strategy doesn't seem to consistently maximize gains, as the public pot's size varies greatly due to the varying contributions of other players. In some rounds, player_0 could have potentially gained more by contributing fewer tokens when others contribute less, or by contributing more when others contribute significantly more, thus leveraging the 2x multiplier more effectively.\n\nTo mitigate this, a new high-level plan for player_0 could be to adapt their contribution based on the observed contributions of other players. If the average contribution of other players is high, player_0 should contribute more to capitalize on the larger public pot. Conversely, if other players contribute less, player_0 should contribute less to conserve tokens and benefit from the smaller, but still multiplied, pot. Additionally, player_0 should consider the potential for free-ridership, where others might benefit from their contributions without contributing themselves, and adjust contributions accordingly to minimize exploitation.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for the player's inconsistent performance is the lack of a clear strategy in adjusting contributions to the public pot. The player seems to contribute tokens randomly, without considering the contributions of other players or the potential impact on the public good payoff. This has led to instances where the player's contributions did not result in optimal gains.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach, such as conditional contribution: contribute more tokens when others are also contributing significantly, and contribute less or not at all when others are contributing fewer tokens. This way, the player can benefit more from the public good when it is larger, while preserving tokens when the collective contribution is low. Additionally, monitoring the average contribution of other players and adjusting one's own contribution to be slightly below that average can help to free-ride on the contributions of others, potentially leading to higher overall gains.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_0 has been consistently contributing a moderate to high number of tokens to the public pot, often matching or exceeding the average contribution of other players. However, this strategy has not consistently resulted in a proportional gain for player_0, as seen in rounds where other players contributed fewer tokens, leading to a lower public pot multiplier. This can be attributed to the free-rider problem, where some players contribute less while still benefiting from the public good.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a more adaptive strategy. The new plan is to monitor the average contribution of the other players and adjust contributions accordingly. If the average contribution is low, player_0 should contribute less to minimize potential losses. Conversely, if the average contribution is high, player_0 should contribute more to take advantage of the larger public pot. This way, player_0 can balance the risk of contributing to the public good with the potential gain, aiming to optimize individual token accumulation over the course of the game.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is relatively consistent, often contributing 4 or 5 tokens. However, this strategy doesn't always result in the highest gain, as seen in rounds where other players contribute more or fewer tokens. The failure here might be due to not adaptively adjusting contributions based on the actions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more dynamic strategy. This could involve observing the average contribution of other players in previous rounds and adjusting player_0's contribution to be slightly below that average. This way, if others are contributing more, player_0 can benefit from their largesse while minimizing personal risk. Additionally, in rounds where other players contribute significantly less, player_0 could consider contributing less as well to avoid potential low payoffs from a smaller public pot. This adaptive approach should lead to more consistent gains over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) has been consistently contributing a similar number of tokens (usually 3 or 4) to the public pot. However, the player's token balance does not consistently increase, indicating that the contributions might not always result in the most optimal gain. A possible reason for this is that the player is not adapting their contribution strategy based on the actions of the other players. To mitigate this failure, a new plan could be to adopt a more dynamic strategy, where the player observes the average contribution of the other players and adjusts their own contribution to be slightly below that average, aiming to benefit from the public good without over-contributing. This way, the player can potentially exploit the contributions of others while minimizing personal loss. Additionally, in rounds where the player has a higher token balance, they could consider contributing more to take advantage of the larger potential payout, as long as it still results in a net gain.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_0 is contributing tokens consistently, with a preference for contributing 4 or 5 tokens in most rounds. However, there are instances where contributing the maximum number of tokens does not result in the highest gain due to other players contributing less. This can lead to player_0 having a lower gain compared to the round's average. To mitigate this, player_0 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the contributions of other players and adjusting their own contribution to optimize the balance between personal gain and public good. This could involve contributing less when others contribute less and more when others contribute more, aiming to maximize the multiplier effect while minimizing personal loss.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with a tendency to contribute 4 or 5 tokens frequently. This strategy seems to result in gains that are generally around the average, but occasionally lower when the total contribution is lower. A possible reason for failure or suboptimal performance is that player_0 is not effectively adapting to the contributions of the other players, leading to missed opportunities for higher gains when others contribute more and over-contributing when others contribute less.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_0 could be to adopt a more dynamic and cooperative strategy. This could involve observing the average contribution of the other players and adjusting own contributions to be slightly below that average, to benefit from the public good while minimizing personal cost. Additionally, player_0 should consider contributing more when others contribute significantly more, to take advantage of larger public pots. This way, player_0 can better align with the group's behavior and potentially increase overall gains over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's strategy is somewhat inconsistent, contributing anywhere from 1 to 5 tokens in different rounds. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively balance the tradeoff between contributing to the public good and retaining tokens for personal gain. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan would be to adopt a more predictable and adaptive strategy. Player_0 should consider contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens based on the average contribution of other players, ensuring they neither free-ride nor overcontribute. This way, they can maintain a balance between benefiting from the public good and preserving their private tokens. Additionally, if the average contribution of other players decreases, player_0 could slightly increase their contribution to potentially exploit the situation, assuming others might be undercontributing.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been relatively consistent, with a preference for contributing 4 or 5 tokens in most rounds. However, this has not always resulted in optimal gains, especially when other players contribute fewer tokens to the public pot. The variability in other players' contributions creates an uncertainty that affects the potential payoff. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a number of tokens that is proportional to the average contribution of the other players, ensuring that I neither overcontribute nor undercontribute relative to the group. This way, I can better align my actions with the potential payoff and minimize the risk of losing tokens when others contribute less.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is relatively consistent, often contributing 4 or 5 tokens. However, this strategy doesn't seem to consistently yield the highest gains, especially when other players contribute less. The failure here might be due to not adapting to the varying contributions of other players, which affects the total pot and the resulting payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more dynamic strategy. This would involve observing the average contribution of other players in recent rounds and adjusting player_0's contribution to be slightly below that average. This way, if others are contributing less, player_0 would also contribute less but still benefit from the public good, while avoiding over-contributing when others are not. Additionally, considering the total tokens in the pot relative to the number of players can help optimize the expected gain per token contributed.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 1 to 5 tokens per round. This inconsistency might be causing me to miss out on potential gains when the public pot is larger due to higher contributions from other players. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more consistent strategy that takes into account the average contribution of other players. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens, say 40%, to the public pot in each round, adjusting this percentage based on the average contribution of others in previous rounds to optimize for the overall public good and my individual gain. This way, I can balance my personal gain with the collective effort, ensuring a more stable and potentially more rewarding outcome over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 0 (you) has been contributing a consistent amount of tokens, usually around 3 or 4, to the public pot in most rounds. However, there are instances where contributing more or less would have resulted in a higher net gain. For example, in Round 21, contributing 5 tokens led to a gain of 6.4, while in Round 19, contributing only 1 token resulted in a gain of 5.8. A possible reason for the failure to optimize gains is not adaptively adjusting contributions based on the actions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach that takes into account the contributions of other players. This could involve contributing more tokens when others contribute significantly, to benefit from a larger public pot, and contributing less when others contribute less, to retain more tokens for personal gain. Additionally, considering the average contribution of the other players in the previous few rounds and adjusting your contribution accordingly could lead to better overall outcomes.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is not consistently aligned with the optimal contribution level to maximize gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, especially when other players contribute more. To mitigate this, player_0 should adopt a more adaptive strategy, observing the average contribution of other players and adjusting their own contribution to be closer to that average, ensuring a fairer share of the public good payoff. This approach will help balance risk and reward, and potentially increase overall tokens collected over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with varying degrees of consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes their gain. There are instances where the player contributes more tokens when others do the same, but there are also rounds where they contribute less, missing out on potential higher payoffs. A possible reason for this could be a lack of strategic coordination with other players or an incomplete understanding of the contribution patterns of the other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan would be to adopt a more strategic approach based on the observed behavior of other players. This could involve contributing more tokens when others are also contributing significantly, to take advantage of the larger public good multiplier, and contributing less or not at all when others are contributing very little. Additionally, the player could try to predict the potential contributions of others by identifying patterns in their behavior and adjust their own contributions accordingly. This way, the player can better balance the risk of losing tokens with the potential for higher payoffs from the public pot.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0 is contributing tokens consistently, but not always optimally. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher gain, especially when other players contribute more. The failure seems to stem from not adaptively adjusting contributions based on the contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach: contribute tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes the expected gain, taking into account the average contribution of the other players. If the average contribution is high, contribute more to benefit from the larger public good payoff; if the average contribution is low, contribute less to conserve tokens. This strategy aims to balance between cooperation and self-interest, ensuring better long-term gains.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 1 to 5 tokens per round. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good dynamics. The player seems to contribute more tokens when others do, but not always, which might lead to missed opportunities for higher gains when others contribute more.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_0 could be to adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. This could involve observing the average contribution of other players over the previous few rounds and adjusting contributions to match or slightly exceed that average. This way, player_0 can benefit from the multiplied public good while minimizing personal cost when others contribute less. Additionally, incorporating a threshold for minimum and maximum contributions can provide stability and prevent extreme decisions.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with varying degrees of consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes their gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. However, there are also rounds where contributing fewer tokens would have been more beneficial, as the total contribution from other players was low.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach based on the contributions of other players. Player_0 should aim to contribute tokens to the pot when the expected total contribution from others is high, ensuring a larger multiplied public good. Conversely, when the expected contributions from others are low, player_0 should contribute fewer tokens to minimize loss. Additionally, considering the average contribution of other players over the previous few rounds can help in predicting the potential size of the public pot and adjust contributions accordingly. This adaptive strategy should lead to more optimal token management and increased gains over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0 has been contributing a consistent number of tokens, often choosing to contribute 3 or 4 tokens. However, there are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher gain due to the larger public pot. The failure lies in not adaptively adjusting the contribution based on the contributions of other players, which can lead to missed opportunities for higher payoffs.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach: observe the average contribution of other players in the previous round and adjust the contribution by 1 token more or less than that average. This strategy aims to balance personal gain with the potential for a larger public pot, ensuring that player_0 benefits from the cooperation while not over-contributing when others are not. Additionally, if the average contribution is consistently low, player_0 should consider contributing just enough to ensure a positive gain, potentially avoiding free-ridership.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with a tendency to contribute more tokens when other players also contribute more. This approach can lead to suboptimal outcomes when other players contribute less, as player_0 ends up losing tokens without maximizing the public good payoff. To mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a more strategic and stable contribution level, taking into account the average contribution of other players. A possible high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of tokens, say 30%, regardless of others' contributions, to balance risk and reward while maintaining a consistent strategy. This way, player_0 can minimize the impact of other players' variable contributions and potentially increase long-term gains.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) has been contributing tokens to the public pot consistently, but not always optimally. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher gain due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot.

If the average contribution of other players in the previous round is high, player_0 should consider contributing more tokens to maximize the potential gain from the multiplied public pot. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_0 should contribute less to conserve tokens. Additionally, considering the total tokens in the pot and the potential gain from the 2x multiplier can help optimize contributions to balance risk and reward.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been relatively consistent, tending towards contributing 3 or 4 tokens in most rounds. However, this strategy doesn't seem to consistently maximize my gains, as there are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the larger public pot. The other players' contributions also vary, which makes it difficult to predict the optimal contribution.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. I should estimate the total tokens in the pot based on the average contributions of the previous rounds and adjust my contribution to maximize the potential gain. If the average contribution is high, I should contribute more to take advantage of the larger public good. If it's low, I should contribute less to conserve tokens. Additionally, I should consider the potential for free-riding when others contribute more, but this should be balanced against the risk of a lower overall pot if everyone adopts a similar strategy.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0 is contributing tokens to the public pot with a relatively consistent pattern, often choosing to contribute 3 or 4 tokens. However, there seems to be no clear strategy in response to the contributions of other players. This lack of adaptability might be causing player_0 to miss out on potential higher gains when other players contribute more tokens to the pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a more dynamic strategy. A high-level plan could be to monitor the average contribution of the other players and adjust own contributions accordingly. If the average contribution is high, player_0 should contribute more to take advantage of the larger public good payoff. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_0 should contribute less to conserve tokens. This way, player_0 can better align with the group's behavior and optimize personal gains. Additionally, considering the potential for free-riding, player_0 should also be prepared to adjust downward if others consistently contribute less while they contribute more.\n\n```"

      "learnings": "Reflections:\n-Upon reviewing the historical data from Round 1, a possible reason for failure or suboptimal performance is that some players contributed more tokens than others, leading to an unequal distribution of the \"public good\" payoff. In this case, player_0 (myself) contributed 5 tokens, which was less than the average contribution of 6 tokens per player. This resulted in a lower individual gain compared to players who contributed more.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan is to adopt a strategy that considers the average contribution of the group in each round. By estimating the average contribution and contributing slightly above that amount, I aim to maximize my share of the public good while minimizing the risk of being the lowest contributor. This strategy assumes that other players will also act rationally, seeking to optimize their gains. However, it's crucial to continuously adapt this strategy based on the evolving behavior of other players to ensure its effectiveness in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the players, including myself as player_0, are contributing varying amounts of tokens to the public pot. In Round 1, the average contribution was high, resulting in a larger public good payoff, while in Round 2, the average contribution was lower, leading to a smaller payoff. The discrepancy in my contributions (5 tokens in Round 1 and 7 tokens in Round 2) compared to the group's average may have led to suboptimal gains.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more consistent strategy that takes into account the average contribution of other players. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens, say 40%, to the public pot in each round. This way, I maintain a stable level of participation regardless of the actions of others. Additionally, I should monitor the average contribution of other players and adjust my strategy if it appears that the group's average is consistently increasing or decreasing. This adaptive approach will help ensure that my contributions align with the potential for a higher public good payoff.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) has been contributing more tokens to the public pot than the average contribution of the other players in the first three rounds. In Round 1, player_0 contributed 5 tokens, while the average was 5.6 tokens. In Round 2, player_0 contributed 7 tokens, while the average was 5.2 tokens, and in Round 3, player_0 contributed 6 tokens, while the average was 4.2 tokens. This pattern of over-contributing has led to a lower net gain for player_0 compared to the other players, as the public good payoff is divided equally among all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_0 should be to contribute closer to the average number of tokens contributed by the other players. This strategy would balance the individual contribution with the potential benefit from the public good, potentially resulting in a more equitable or even higher net gain over time. It's essential to monitor the average contribution of other players in each round and adjust the contribution accordingly to optimize personal gains without excessively burdening oneself.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) has been contributing a consistent amount of tokens (5, 7, 6, 5) to the public pot across the rounds. However, the contributions do not seem to be optimized based on the other players' actions. In some rounds, contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher individual gain (e.g., Round 1), while in others, contributing less might have been more beneficial (e.g., Round 3).\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan is to adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach to contribution. This can be achieved by estimating the average contribution of other players in each round and adjusting player_0's contribution to maintain a balance between maximizing the public good and minimizing personal loss. If the average contribution of others is high, player_0 should contribute more to capitalize on the larger public pot. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_0 should contribute less to preserve tokens. This strategy aims to optimize the trade-off between cooperation and self-interest, leading to potentially higher cumulative gains over the remaining rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for suboptimal performance is that you, as player_0, have consistently contributed the same number of tokens (5 or 6) without adjusting your strategy to the actions of other players. This rigidity may lead to missed opportunities for higher gains when other players contribute more tokens, or conversely, when they contribute less.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan is to adopt a dynamic contribution strategy. This could involve monitoring the average contribution of other players in each round and adjusting your contribution to be slightly below that average. By doing so, you can benefit from the public good while minimizing the risk of over-contributing when others do not. Additionally, consider contributing slightly more when the total tokens in the pot have the potential to result in a higher multiplier, as this could lead to a more favorable payoff.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been relatively consistent, contributing around 5-7 tokens in each round. However, the contributions of other players vary, and there doesn't seem to be a clear pattern. This inconsistency in others' contributions leads to unpredictable payoffs. A possible reason for failure is not adapting my contribution based on the actions of other players, which could result in suboptimal gains when others contribute less.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy. A high-level plan would be to contribute a number of tokens that is proportional to the average contribution of the other players in the previous round. This way, I can adjust my participation according to the group's behavior, potentially maximizing my gain when others contribute more, while minimizing losses when they contribute less. Additionally, I should consider implementing a threshold for minimum and maximum contributions to balance risk and reward.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for the failure or suboptimal performance is that the player (player_0) has consistently contributed 5 tokens in every round, without adapting to the varying contributions of the other players. This static strategy might lead to missed opportunities for higher gains when other players contribute more tokens, and it could also result in lower gains when others contribute less.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan is to adopt a dynamic contribution strategy. This strategy should involve observing the average contribution of the other players in each round and adjusting the contribution accordingly. If the average contribution is higher, player_0 should contribute more to maximize the potential public good payoff. Conversely, if the average contribution is lower, player_0 should contribute less to conserve tokens. This adaptive approach should help align player_0's actions with the potential rewards, leading to potentially better overall outcomes.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for the failure or suboptimal performance is that the player (player_0) has consistently contributed the same number of tokens (usually 5 or 6) without adapting to the varying contributions of the other players. This static strategy might lead to missed opportunities for higher payoffs when other players contribute more, and it exposes the player to free-riding when others contribute less.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan is to adopt a dynamic contribution strategy. This strategy should involve observing the average contribution of the other players in each round and adjusting the contribution accordingly. If the average contribution is high, player_0 should contribute more to take advantage of the larger public pot. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_0 should contribute less to minimize potential losses from free-riders. This adaptive approach should help optimize the player's gains over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been relatively consistent, contributing around 5-7 tokens per round. However, this strategy doesn't seem to be optimized for maximizing my token count, as my token balance fluctuates and doesn't show a clear upward trend. The other players' contributions also vary, making it difficult to predict the optimal contribution.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the average contribution of other players. If the average contribution is high, contributing fewer tokens might be more beneficial to avoid over-contributing to the public pot. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, contributing more tokens could lead to a higher multiplier on the public good, potentially resulting in a better payoff. A simple plan could be to contribute 1 token less than the average contribution of the other players in the previous round, aiming to balance personal gain with the group's effort. This adaptive strategy should help me better align my contributions with the potential payoffs.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 0 (you) has consistently contributed 5 or 6 tokens in most rounds, with a few instances of contributing 4 tokens. This strategy seems to be relatively stable, but it doesn't always optimize the gain. In rounds where other players contribute more tokens, contributing 6 might not be the most efficient choice since the public good payoff is divided equally among all players. A possible reason for not maximizing gains is the lack of adaptability to the varying contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more dynamic strategy. This could involve observing the average contribution of other players in the previous round and adjusting your contribution to be slightly below that average. This way, you can benefit from the public good without over-contributing when others are contributing less. Additionally, consider contributing slightly more when the total contribution from others is high, to take advantage of the larger multiplier without significantly depleting your private tokens. This adaptive approach should lead to more balanced and potentially higher gains over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for suboptimal performance is that player_0 is not consistently contributing the optimal number of tokens to maximize their gains. There seems to be a lack of strategic adaptation to the varying contributions of other players. To mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a more dynamic strategy, such as contributing tokens equal to the average contribution of the other players in the previous round, plus or minus a small adjustment based on the success of that round. This will help align player_0's contributions with the potential for a higher public good payoff while also considering the risk of over-contributing when others do not. Additionally, monitoring the overall token trends and adjusting the strategy as the game progresses could lead to better long-term gains.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) has been contributing a relatively consistent amount of tokens to the public pot, usually around 5 or 6 tokens per round. However, the player's token balance has not consistently increased, indicating that the contributions might not be optimized for maximum gain. The player seems to be contributing slightly more than the average contribution of other players, which could lead to a lower individual return due to the even division of the public good payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this potential failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic and adaptive contribution strategy. This could involve monitoring the average contribution of other players and contributing just enough tokens to slightly exceed that average, aiming for a balance between contributing to the public good and retaining tokens for personal gain. Additionally, in rounds where the total contribution from others is low, player_0 should consider contributing less to avoid overinvesting in a round with a potentially low public good payoff. This way, the player can optimize their individual token balance over the long run.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0 is contributing a consistent amount of tokens (mainly 5 or 6) to the public pot, while other players' contributions vary round to round. This consistency could be both a strength and a weakness. On one hand, it demonstrates a predictable strategy, but on the other hand, it might lead to suboptimal gains when other players contribute less, as seen in Round 12 and 13. The public good is maximized when all players contribute equally, but the variability in others' contributions suggests free-riding behavior.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a more dynamic strategy, adjusting contributions based on the observed contributions of other players. If others are contributing more, player_0 should also contribute more to maximize the public good and individual gain. Conversely, if others contribute less, player_0 should contribute less to avoid punished by a lower public pot. This adaptive strategy will help align player_0's actions with the potential payoffs, reducing the impact of others' inconsistent behavior.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0 is not consistently optimizing their contribution to maximize their token count. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. For example, in Round 4, contributing 6 tokens instead of 5 would have led to the same public pot but a higher individual gain. To mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players and adjusts their own contribution to maximize the benefit from the 2x multiplier, while also considering the potential loss of tokens. A possible plan is to contribute slightly more than the average contribution of other players to leverage the multiplier without over-contributing when others are contributing less.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) has been contributing tokens to the public pot consistently, but not always in a way that maximizes their gain. There seems to be a lack of strategic coordination with other players, as contributions are not consistently aligned with the highest payoffs. A possible reason for this is that player_0 is not effectively predicting or adapting to the contribution patterns of the other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more dynamic strategy. This would involve observing the average contribution of other players in previous rounds and adjusting player_0's contribution to be slightly below that average. This way, if others are under-contributing, player_0 can benefit from their lower total contribution while still contributing enough to the public pot to receive a decent share of the multiplied payoff. Additionally, player_0 should consider contributing more when the total contribution from others is low, as this could lead to a higher multiplier on the public good and a potentially larger individual gain.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 3 to 6 tokens. This inconsistency might be causing me to miss out on potential gains when other players contribute more, and it could also signal to other players that my behavior is unpredictable. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more consistent strategy that takes into account the average contribution of other players. A high-level plan would be to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens, say 75%, if the average contribution of other players is above a certain threshold, and contribute the minimum (e.g., 1 token) if it's below that threshold. This way, I can balance the risk of contributing too much when others contribute little and ensure I benefit from rounds with higher collective contributions.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is not consistently aligned with the optimal contribution level to maximize individual gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, especially when other players contribute more. The failure lies in not effectively predicting and adjusting to the varying contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a dynamic strategy that considers the average contribution of other players in the previous round. If the average contribution is high, player_0 should contribute more to capitalize on the larger public good. If the average contribution is low, contributing less might be more beneficial to avoid losing tokens without a significant public pot multiplier. Additionally, player_0 should also consider a threshold for the minimum return on investment, not contributing if the potential gain is too low compared to the tokens contributed. This adaptive approach should lead to better overall token accumulation over the remaining rounds.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player's contribution strategy is inconsistent, often contributing less than the average contribution of other players. This might be due to an attempt to conserve tokens or a lack of coordination with other players. To mitigate this failure, a new plan could be to adopt a more cooperative strategy, contributing an amount equal to or slightly above the average contribution of the previous round, with the aim of maximizing the public good and thus the overall gain for all players. Additionally, monitoring the contributions of other players and adjusting one's own contribution accordingly can lead to better collective outcomes.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been relatively consistent, usually contributing around 4-6 tokens per round. However, this has not always resulted in optimal gains, especially when other players contribute fewer tokens to the public pot. The public good is multiplied by 2, so when contributions are low, the benefit of contributing more tokens is also lower. This can lead to situations where my contributions outweigh the benefits received.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. If other players are contributing less, I should also contribute less to avoid being a \"free-rider\" for others. Conversely, if others contribute more, I should increase my contribution to maximize the multiplier effect. A simple approach could be to contribute a percentage of the average contribution of all players, ensuring a balanced approach that adapts to the behavior of the group. This way, I can better align my actions with the potential payoffs in each round.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where player_0 contributes more tokens to the public pot when the average contribution from other players is lower, leading to a lower individual return on investment. For example, in Round 12, player_0 contributed 5 tokens when the average contribution was only 3, resulting in a lower gain compared to the previous round.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A high-level plan could be to contribute tokens in proportion to the average contribution of the other players, ensuring a more balanced distribution of effort and potentially maximizing individual gains. If the average contribution is low, player_0 should contribute less, and if the average is high, player_0 should contribute more. This way, player_0 can maintain a consistent ratio of contribution to the public good, which should lead to more optimal outcomes over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player's contribution strategy is inconsistent, often contributing less than the average tokens contributed by other players. This has led to lower gains in several rounds, especially when other players contribute more. The player seems to be under-contributing in rounds where the collective contribution is higher, missing out on the potential for a larger public good payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more cooperative strategy, contributing an amount close to the average contribution of other players in each round. This would help ensure a more equitable share of the public good and potentially lead to higher overall gains. Additionally, the player should consider adjusting contributions based on the round's remaining tokens, contributing more when the pot is likely to result in a higher multiplier, and conserving tokens when the pot is smaller.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, ranging from 1 to 6 tokens per round. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good dynamics. The game rewards cooperation when everyone contributes, but player_0's lower contributions in some rounds might lead to lower payoffs when others contribute more.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_0 would be to adopt a more cooperative and stable contribution strategy. A potential approach is to consistently contribute a fixed number of tokens, say the average or median of the previous rounds' contributions, to balance personal gain with the need for collective contribution. This way, player_0 can benefit from the multiplied public good while minimizing the risk of free-riding by other players. Additionally, monitoring the contributions of other players and adjusting the contribution level based on their behavior (e.g., if others consistently contribute more, player_0 should consider increasing their contribution) could also improve the overall outcome.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly more. For example, in Round 19, contributing more than 1 token would have led to a higher gain, and in Round 21, contributing less than 10 tokens would have been more beneficial.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A new plan could be to contribute a number of tokens that is slightly less than the average contribution of the other players, ensuring a fair share of the public good payoff while minimizing personal loss. Additionally, in situations where the total contribution from others is very high, player_0 should consider contributing more to capitalize on the larger multiplier. This adaptive strategy should lead to more consistent gains over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their long-term gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. For example, in Round 19, contributing more than 1 token would have led to a higher gain given the tokens contributed by other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan is to adopt a more strategic contribution strategy. This could involve observing the average contribution of other players and contributing just enough to ensure the public pot is substantial without over-contributing. If the average contribution of others is high, player_0 should contribute more to take advantage of the multiplier. If the average is low, contributing less might be optimal to avoid losing tokens without a significant public good payoff. Additionally, considering the remaining tokens and the game's progression can help balance risk and reward in the long run.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 1 to 6 tokens. This inconsistency might be causing me to miss out on potential gains when other players contribute more tokens to the pot. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. A high-level plan would be to monitor the average contribution of other players over the last few rounds and adjust my contribution to be slightly below that average, ensuring a fair share of the public good while minimizing personal risk. This way, I can benefit from the collective contributions without overextending myself when others are not contributing as much.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0 is not consistently optimizing their contribution to the public pot in order to maximize their gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplication factor, while in other cases, contributing fewer tokens would have been more beneficial. The player seems to be following a pattern without fully considering the varying contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of the other players. A potential high-level plan is to estimate the average contribution of the other players and contribute just enough tokens to ensure that the total pot multiplied by 2 is slightly above the average contribution per player. This way, the player can benefit from the public good without over-contributing. Additionally, if the player notices a trend of others contributing less, they should also adjust downward to conserve tokens. This adaptive strategy should lead to better long-term gains.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) is not consistently optimizing their contribution to the public pot in order to maximize their gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier, while in other cases, contributing fewer tokens might have been more beneficial to avoid free-riding by other players. The player seems to be contributing an average amount without a clear strategy.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a dynamic contribution strategy based on the average contribution of other players. If the average contribution is low, player_0 should contribute slightly more to potentially benefit from the higher multiplier. If the average contribution is high, player_0 should contribute slightly less to balance the risk of others freeloading off their contribution. Additionally, considering the remaining tokens and the stage of the game should also influence the decision, as the player may want to conserve tokens towards the end or take advantage of others' fatigue. This adaptive strategy aims to maximize gains while minimizing the risk of exploitation.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 1 to 6 tokens. This inconsistency might be causing me to miss out on potential gains when other players contribute more tokens to the public pot. To mitigate this, I should adopt a more strategic and stable approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens, say 40%, to the public pot in each round. This way, I can maintain a consistent strategy while still benefiting from the public good, regardless of the actions of other players. Additionally, this approach will help balance risk and reward, as it ensures I'm not overly invested in any single round while still contributing enough to benefit from the multiplied payoff.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly more. For example, in Round 21, contributing more than 4 tokens would have led to a higher individual payoff due to the high total tokens in the pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A potential high-level plan is to estimate the average contribution of other players and contribute slightly more than that average to benefit from the 2x multiplier while ensuring a fair division of the public good payoff. Additionally, player_0 should be cautious of rounds with low total contributions, as contributing too many tokens in those rounds could result in a lower payoff per token contributed.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with varying degrees of consistency, but often in the higher range (4 or 5 tokens). While this strategy sometimes results in higher gains when other players also contribute significantly, there are instances where the player's contribution is not matched by others, leading to lower gains compared to more conservative contributions. The player seems to be more prone to contribute more tokens when other players also contribute, but this does not always result in a favorable outcome.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more adaptive strategy. Player_0 should consider the average contribution of the other players in the previous round and adjust their own contribution accordingly. If the average contribution is high, player_0 can contribute more to capitalize on the potential larger public good payoff. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_0 should contribute less to conserve tokens. Additionally, the player should also factor in their current token balance, contributing more when they have a surplus and less when their token count is lower to minimize potential losses. This way, the player can balance risk and reward more effectively.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been relatively consistent, tending towards contributing 4 or 5 tokens in most rounds. However, this consistency has not necessarily led to optimal gains, as the public pot's size varies greatly due to the varying contributions of other players. In some rounds, my contributions have resulted in lower gains when the pot is smaller, while in others, I might have benefited more by contributing less when others contribute more.\n\nTo mitigate this, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A potential high-level plan is to estimate the average contribution of the other players and adjust my contribution to maintain a roughly constant ratio to the total pot. If the average contribution of others increases, I should contribute more to maintain the ratio, and if it decreases, I should contribute less. This way, I aim to optimize my gains by ensuring a more equitable share of the public good, considering the actions of other players. Additionally, I should consider incorporating a threshold for minimum and maximum contributions to balance risk and reward.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly more tokens. To mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the average contribution of other players. If the average contribution is high, player_0 should contribute more to capitalize on the larger public good payoff. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_0 should contribute less to conserve tokens. This way, player_0 can better align their contributions with potential payoffs and maximize their token balance over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with varying degrees of consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes their gain. There are instances where player_0 contributes more tokens than the average contribution, leading to a lower individual gain when other players contribute less. This suggests a lack of strategic coordination or information about other players' behavior.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more conditional contribution strategy. Player_0 should monitor the average contribution of the other players and contribute just enough to match or slightly exceed that average, ensuring a more balanced distribution of gains. Additionally, in rounds where other players contribute significantly more, player_0 should also increase their contribution to take advantage of the larger public pot. This approach balances risk and reward while adapting to the behavior of other players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0 (you) has been contributing a consistent, but not always optimal, number of tokens to the public pot. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher gain, especially when other players contribute significantly more. The failure here lies in not adaptively adjusting contributions based on the actions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach: observe the average contribution of other players in the previous round and adjust your contribution to be slightly below that average. This way, you can benefit from the public good without over-contributing when others are not. Additionally, consider contributing more when the total contribution from others is likely to result in a higher multiplier on the public pot, ensuring a better return on investment.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly more tokens. To mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the average contribution of other players. If the average contribution is high, player_0 should contribute more to capitalize on the larger public good payoff. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_0 should contribute less to conserve tokens. This way, player_0 can better align their contributions with the potential rewards, maximizing their overall gain over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) has been contributing tokens to the public pot consistently, but not always optimally. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the higher multiplication factor, while in other cases, contributing fewer tokens would have preserved more of the player's private tokens. The player seems to be contributing around 4 tokens on average, which might not always align with the average contribution of the other players.\n\nTo mitigate this, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more adaptive strategy. This strategy would involve estimating the average contribution of the other players and contributing just enough tokens to ensure a slightly higher than average share of the public good payoff, while also considering the potential risk of over-contributing if others contribute less. By dynamically adjusting contributions based on the observed behavior of other players, player_0 can potentially maximize their gains over time. Additionally, the player should also account for the diminishing marginal returns of contributing more tokens when the public pot is already substantial, as the multiplication factor remains constant.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_0 has a consistent tendency to contribute 4 or 5 tokens in most rounds, with occasional contributions of 3 or 1 token. This strategy seems to result in an average gain per round, but it doesn't always optimize the player's token count, as seen in rounds where the public pot is lower due to other players' lower contributions. The player's token count fluctuates but doesn't show a clear upward trend.\n\nTo mitigate this, player_0 should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A potential high-level plan is to contribute just enough tokens to ensure a higher public pot multiplication factor while minimizing personal loss if others contribute significantly less. This could involve monitoring the average contribution of other players and adjusting contributions accordingly, aiming for a balance between cooperation and self-interest. Additionally, in rounds where other players contribute very little, player_0 should consider contributing less to avoid subsidizing free riders.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is rather consistent, usually contributing 4 or 5 tokens per round. However, this strategy doesn't seem to consistently maximize gains, as the public pot's size varies greatly due to the varying contributions of other players. In some rounds, player_0 could have potentially gained more by contributing fewer tokens when others contribute less, or by contributing more when others contribute significantly more, thus leveraging the 2x multiplier more effectively.\n\nTo mitigate this, a new high-level plan for player_0 could be to adapt their contribution based on the observed contributions of other players. If the average contribution of other players is high, player_0 should contribute more to capitalize on the larger public pot. Conversely, if other players contribute less, player_0 should contribute less to conserve tokens and benefit from the smaller, but still multiplied, pot. Additionally, player_0 should consider the potential for free-ridership, where others might benefit from their contributions without contributing themselves, and adjust contributions accordingly to minimize exploitation.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for the player's inconsistent performance is the lack of a clear strategy in adjusting contributions to the public pot. The player seems to contribute tokens randomly, without considering the contributions of other players or the potential impact on the public good payoff. This has led to instances where the player's contributions did not result in optimal gains.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach, such as conditional contribution: contribute more tokens when others are also contributing significantly, and contribute less or not at all when others are contributing fewer tokens. This way, the player can benefit more from the public good when it is larger, while preserving tokens when the collective contribution is low. Additionally, monitoring the average contribution of other players and adjusting one's own contribution to be slightly below that average can help to free-ride on the contributions of others, potentially leading to higher overall gains.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_0 has been consistently contributing a moderate to high number of tokens to the public pot, often matching or exceeding the average contribution of other players. However, this strategy has not consistently resulted in a proportional gain for player_0, as seen in rounds where other players contributed fewer tokens, leading to a lower public pot multiplier. This can be attributed to the free-rider problem, where some players contribute less while still benefiting from the public good.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a more adaptive strategy. The new plan is to monitor the average contribution of the other players and adjust contributions accordingly. If the average contribution is low, player_0 should contribute less to minimize potential losses. Conversely, if the average contribution is high, player_0 should contribute more to take advantage of the larger public pot. This way, player_0 can balance the risk of contributing to the public good with the potential gain, aiming to optimize individual token accumulation over the course of the game.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is relatively consistent, often contributing 4 or 5 tokens. However, this strategy doesn't always result in the highest gain, as seen in rounds where other players contribute more or fewer tokens. The failure here might be due to not adaptively adjusting contributions based on the actions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more dynamic strategy. This could involve observing the average contribution of other players in previous rounds and adjusting player_0's contribution to be slightly below that average. This way, if others are contributing more, player_0 can benefit from their largesse while minimizing personal risk. Additionally, in rounds where other players contribute significantly less, player_0 could consider contributing less as well to avoid potential low payoffs from a smaller public pot. This adaptive approach should lead to more consistent gains over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) has been consistently contributing a similar number of tokens (usually 3 or 4) to the public pot. However, the player's token balance does not consistently increase, indicating that the contributions might not always result in the most optimal gain. A possible reason for this is that the player is not adapting their contribution strategy based on the actions of the other players. To mitigate this failure, a new plan could be to adopt a more dynamic strategy, where the player observes the average contribution of the other players and adjusts their own contribution to be slightly below that average, aiming to benefit from the public good without over-contributing. This way, the player can potentially exploit the contributions of others while minimizing personal loss. Additionally, in rounds where the player has a higher token balance, they could consider contributing more to take advantage of the larger potential payout, as long as it still results in a net gain.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_0 is contributing tokens consistently, with a preference for contributing 4 or 5 tokens in most rounds. However, there are instances where contributing the maximum number of tokens does not result in the highest gain due to other players contributing less. This can lead to player_0 having a lower gain compared to the round's average. To mitigate this, player_0 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the contributions of other players and adjusting their own contribution to optimize the balance between personal gain and public good. This could involve contributing less when others contribute less and more when others contribute more, aiming to maximize the multiplier effect while minimizing personal loss.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with a tendency to contribute 4 or 5 tokens frequently. This strategy seems to result in gains that are generally around the average, but occasionally lower when the total contribution is lower. A possible reason for failure or suboptimal performance is that player_0 is not effectively adapting to the contributions of the other players, leading to missed opportunities for higher gains when others contribute more and over-contributing when others contribute less.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_0 could be to adopt a more dynamic and cooperative strategy. This could involve observing the average contribution of the other players and adjusting own contributions to be slightly below that average, to benefit from the public good while minimizing personal cost. Additionally, player_0 should consider contributing more when others contribute significantly more, to take advantage of larger public pots. This way, player_0 can better align with the group's behavior and potentially increase overall gains over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's strategy is somewhat inconsistent, contributing anywhere from 1 to 5 tokens in different rounds. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively balance the tradeoff between contributing to the public good and retaining tokens for personal gain. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan would be to adopt a more predictable and adaptive strategy. Player_0 should consider contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens based on the average contribution of other players, ensuring they neither free-ride nor overcontribute. This way, they can maintain a balance between benefiting from the public good and preserving their private tokens. Additionally, if the average contribution of other players decreases, player_0 could slightly increase their contribution to potentially exploit the situation, assuming others might be undercontributing.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been relatively consistent, with a preference for contributing 4 or 5 tokens in most rounds. However, this has not always resulted in optimal gains, especially when other players contribute fewer tokens to the public pot. The variability in other players' contributions creates an uncertainty that affects the potential payoff. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a number of tokens that is proportional to the average contribution of the other players, ensuring that I neither overcontribute nor undercontribute relative to the group. This way, I can better align my actions with the potential payoff and minimize the risk of losing tokens when others contribute less.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is relatively consistent, often contributing 4 or 5 tokens. However, this strategy doesn't seem to consistently yield the highest gains, especially when other players contribute less. The failure here might be due to not adapting to the varying contributions of other players, which affects the total pot and the resulting payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more dynamic strategy. This would involve observing the average contribution of other players in recent rounds and adjusting player_0's contribution to be slightly below that average. This way, if others are contributing less, player_0 would also contribute less but still benefit from the public good, while avoiding over-contributing when others are not. Additionally, considering the total tokens in the pot relative to the number of players can help optimize the expected gain per token contributed.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 1 to 5 tokens per round. This inconsistency might be causing me to miss out on potential gains when the public pot is larger due to higher contributions from other players. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more consistent strategy that takes into account the average contribution of other players. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens, say 40%, to the public pot in each round, adjusting this percentage based on the average contribution of others in previous rounds to optimize for the overall public good and my individual gain. This way, I can balance my personal gain with the collective effort, ensuring a more stable and potentially more rewarding outcome over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 0 (you) has been contributing a consistent amount of tokens, usually around 3 or 4, to the public pot in most rounds. However, there are instances where contributing more or less would have resulted in a higher net gain. For example, in Round 21, contributing 5 tokens led to a gain of 6.4, while in Round 19, contributing only 1 token resulted in a gain of 5.8. A possible reason for the failure to optimize gains is not adaptively adjusting contributions based on the actions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach that takes into account the contributions of other players. This could involve contributing more tokens when others contribute significantly, to benefit from a larger public pot, and contributing less when others contribute less, to retain more tokens for personal gain. Additionally, considering the average contribution of the other players in the previous few rounds and adjusting your contribution accordingly could lead to better overall outcomes.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is not consistently aligned with the optimal contribution level to maximize gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, especially when other players contribute more. To mitigate this, player_0 should adopt a more adaptive strategy, observing the average contribution of other players and adjusting their own contribution to be closer to that average, ensuring a fairer share of the public good payoff. This approach will help balance risk and reward, and potentially increase overall tokens collected over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with varying degrees of consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes their gain. There are instances where the player contributes more tokens when others do the same, but there are also rounds where they contribute less, missing out on potential higher payoffs. A possible reason for this could be a lack of strategic coordination with other players or an incomplete understanding of the contribution patterns of the other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan would be to adopt a more strategic approach based on the observed behavior of other players. This could involve contributing more tokens when others are also contributing significantly, to take advantage of the larger public good multiplier, and contributing less or not at all when others are contributing very little. Additionally, the player could try to predict the potential contributions of others by identifying patterns in their behavior and adjust their own contributions accordingly. This way, the player can better balance the risk of losing tokens with the potential for higher payoffs from the public pot.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0 is contributing tokens consistently, but not always optimally. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher gain, especially when other players contribute more. The failure seems to stem from not adaptively adjusting contributions based on the contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach: contribute tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes the expected gain, taking into account the average contribution of the other players. If the average contribution is high, contribute more to benefit from the larger public good payoff; if the average contribution is low, contribute less to conserve tokens. This strategy aims to balance between cooperation and self-interest, ensuring better long-term gains.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 1 to 5 tokens per round. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good dynamics. The player seems to contribute more tokens when others do, but not always, which might lead to missed opportunities for higher gains when others contribute more.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_0 could be to adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. This could involve observing the average contribution of other players over the previous few rounds and adjusting contributions to match or slightly exceed that average. This way, player_0 can benefit from the multiplied public good while minimizing personal cost when others contribute less. Additionally, incorporating a threshold for minimum and maximum contributions can provide stability and prevent extreme decisions.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with varying degrees of consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes their gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. However, there are also rounds where contributing fewer tokens would have been more beneficial, as the total contribution from other players was low.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach based on the contributions of other players. Player_0 should aim to contribute tokens to the pot when the expected total contribution from others is high, ensuring a larger multiplied public good. Conversely, when the expected contributions from others are low, player_0 should contribute fewer tokens to minimize loss. Additionally, considering the average contribution of other players over the previous few rounds can help in predicting the potential size of the public pot and adjust contributions accordingly. This adaptive strategy should lead to more optimal token management and increased gains over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0 has been contributing a consistent number of tokens, often choosing to contribute 3 or 4 tokens. However, there are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher gain due to the larger public pot. The failure lies in not adaptively adjusting the contribution based on the contributions of other players, which can lead to missed opportunities for higher payoffs.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach: observe the average contribution of other players in the previous round and adjust the contribution by 1 token more or less than that average. This strategy aims to balance personal gain with the potential for a larger public pot, ensuring that player_0 benefits from the cooperation while not over-contributing when others are not. Additionally, if the average contribution is consistently low, player_0 should consider contributing just enough to ensure a positive gain, potentially avoiding free-ridership.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with a tendency to contribute more tokens when other players also contribute more. This approach can lead to suboptimal outcomes when other players contribute less, as player_0 ends up losing tokens without maximizing the public good payoff. To mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a more strategic and stable contribution level, taking into account the average contribution of other players. A possible high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of tokens, say 30%, regardless of others' contributions, to balance risk and reward while maintaining a consistent strategy. This way, player_0 can minimize the impact of other players' variable contributions and potentially increase long-term gains.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the player (player_0) has been contributing tokens to the public pot consistently, but not always optimally. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher gain due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. The player seems to be contributing around 3-5 tokens most of the time, which can lead to missed opportunities when other players contribute more tokens, creating a larger public good payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the average contribution of other players. If the average contribution of other players in the previous round is high, player_0 should consider contributing more tokens to maximize the potential gain from the multiplied public pot. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_0 should contribute less to conserve tokens. Additionally, considering the total tokens in the pot and the potential gain from the 2x multiplier can help optimize contributions to balance risk and reward.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been relatively consistent, tending towards contributing 3 or 4 tokens in most rounds. However, this strategy doesn't seem to consistently maximize my gains, as there are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the larger public pot. The other players' contributions also vary, which makes it difficult to predict the optimal contribution.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. I should estimate the total tokens in the pot based on the average contributions of the previous rounds and adjust my contribution to maximize the potential gain. If the average contribution is high, I should contribute more to take advantage of the larger public good. If it's low, I should contribute less to conserve tokens. Additionally, I should consider the potential for free-riding when others contribute more, but this should be balanced against the risk of a lower overall pot if everyone adopts a similar strategy.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_0 is contributing tokens to the public pot with a relatively consistent pattern, often choosing to contribute 3 or 4 tokens. However, there seems to be no clear strategy in response to the contributions of other players. This lack of adaptability might be causing player_0 to miss out on potential higher gains when other players contribute more tokens to the pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_0 should adopt a more dynamic strategy. A high-level plan could be to monitor the average contribution of the other players and adjust own contributions accordingly. If the average contribution is high, player_0 should contribute more to take advantage of the larger public good payoff. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_0 should contribute less to conserve tokens. This way, player_0 can better align with the group's behavior and optimize personal gains. Additionally, considering the potential for free-riding, player_0 should also be prepared to adjust downward if others consistently contribute less while they contribute more.\n",

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-Upon reviewing the historical data from Round 1, a possible reason for failure or suboptimal performance is that some players contributed more tokens than others, leading to an unequal distribution of the \"public good\" payoff. In this case, Player 5 contributed the most tokens (8) but did not receive a proportionally higher share of the payoff. This could indicate a lack of coordination or strategic thinking among the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more cooperative strategy, where all players agree to contribute an equal number of tokens to the public pot in each round. This would ensure a more equitable distribution of the public good payoff and potentially maximize the collective gain. To implement this plan, I would need to communicate with the other players and establish a level of trust to ensure they also follow the agreed-upon strategy.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data provided, it appears that players are contributing varying amounts of tokens to the public pot. In Round 1, you contributed 5 tokens, while in Round 2, you contributed 4 tokens. The public good payoff is determined by the total tokens in the pot multiplied by 2, and then evenly divided among all players. Your gains in both rounds were slightly above the average contribution, suggesting that some players might be contributing more than others, while you are contributing slightly less.\n\nA possible reason for failure or suboptimal performance is not adapting your contribution strategy based on the actions of other players. If others consistently contribute more, you could be leaving potential gains on the table by contributing less.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more cooperative strategy, where you aim to contribute an amount close to the average contribution of other players. This way, you can potentially benefit from the higher public good payoff without excessively depleting your private tokens. Additionally, monitoring the pattern of other players' contributions and adjusting your strategy accordingly can lead to better overall performance.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the players, including myself, are contributing varying amounts of tokens to the public pot. In Round 1, the average contribution was high, leading to a larger public good payoff. However, in Round 2 and Round 3, the average contribution decreased, resulting in lower payoffs. The inconsistency in players' contributions might be due to strategic adjustments or uncertainty about the optimal contribution level.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my strategy, I should adopt a more consistent approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens to the public pot in each round, say 40%, which balances risk and reward. This way, I can maintain a stable strategy regardless of other players' actions, and potentially exploit their fluctuations if they continue to vary their contributions. Additionally, this strategy might encourage others to contribute more if they perceive my contribution as reliable, thus increasing the public good for all.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been inconsistent. In Round 1, I contributed 5 tokens, then 4 tokens in Round 2, 5 tokens in Round 3, and 9 tokens in Round 4. This inconsistency could lead to unpredictable payoffs and might not optimize my long-term gain. A possible reason for this failure is the lack of a clear, systematic approach to deciding how many tokens to contribute.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose a new high-level plan: adopt a more stable and strategic contribution level, such as contributing a fixed percentage of my tokens or using a tit-for-tat approach where I match the average contribution of other players in the previous round. This would provide a more consistent strategy and potentially lead to better overall payoffs. Additionally, I should consider the potential for free-riding, where others might contribute less while still benefiting from the public good, and adjust my strategy accordingly to balance cooperation and self-interest.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been inconsistent. In Round 4, I contributed significantly more tokens (9) than in the other rounds (ranging from 4 to 5), which resulted in a lower gain due to the public pot being multiplied by a factor of 2. This suggests that contributing more tokens does not necessarily lead to a proportionally higher individual gain when other players' contributions are taken into account.\n\nTo mitigate this inconsistent strategy and potentially optimize my gains, I should adopt a more balanced and strategic approach. A possible high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens, say 20%, to the public pot in each round. This would ensure a consistent strategy while also allowing me to retain a majority of my tokens for potential future gains. Additionally, I should consider the contributions of other players, especially if they consistently contribute more, as that might indicate a more effective strategy that I should adapt to.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been inconsistent, alternating between contributing 4 and 5 tokens in most rounds. This inconsistency might be causing me to miss out on potential higher payoffs when other players contribute more tokens to the public pot. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the average contribution of other players. If the average contribution is higher in previous rounds, I should contribute more to maximize the public good payoff. Conversely, if others contribute less, I should also contribute less to conserve my tokens. This way, I can better align my contributions with the potential benefits and minimize losses.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been inconsistent, alternating between contributing 4 and 5 tokens in most rounds.

Conversely, if others contribute less, I should also contribute less to conserve my tokens. This way, I can better align my contributions with the potential benefits, leading to a more efficient use of my resources.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been somewhat inconsistent. In some rounds, I contributed more tokens when others did as well, while in other rounds, I contributed less. This inconsistency might be causing me to miss out on potential gains when others contribute more, and it could also signal to other players that my strategy is unpredictable, potentially leading them to exploit my behavior.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more consistent and adaptive strategy. A possible high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens to the public pot in each round, say 40%, which is a balance between risk and reward. This way, I maintain a stable pattern while still benefiting from the public good. Additionally, I should monitor the average contribution of other players and adjust my percentage slightly if their contributions consistently increase or decrease, ensuring I remain competitive without being overly exploited.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been somewhat inconsistent. In some rounds, I contributed more tokens when others did the same, while in others, I contributed less. This inconsistency might be causing me to miss out on potential gains when others contribute more, or lose tokens when I contribute more and others contribute less. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. A high-level plan could be to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens based on the average contribution of the other players in the previous round. This way, I can align my contributions with the group's behavior, potentially maximizing my gains while minimizing losses. Additionally, I should consider contributing more when the public pot can result in a higher multiplier, ensuring a better return on investment.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been somewhat inconsistent, alternating between contributing 4 and 5 tokens in most rounds. This inconsistency might be causing me to miss out on potential gains when other players contribute more tokens to the public pot. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. I propose a plan to monitor the average contribution of other players and adjust my contribution to be slightly below that average, ensuring I benefit from their contributions while not over-contributing. This way, I can balance risk and reward more effectively and potentially increase my overall token count.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that optimizes their gains. There seems to be a lack of strategic coordination with other players, as player_1's contributions don't always align with the highest payoffs. To mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing tokens when the expected public good payoff is higher than the average contribution, or when it is likely that others will contribute significantly, thus maximizing the multiplication factor. Additionally, player_1 should consider the potential for free-riding behavior in others and adjust their contributions accordingly to avoid over-contributing when others are likely to contribute less.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been somewhat inconsistent. In some rounds, I contributed more tokens when others contributed less, while in other rounds, I contributed less when others contributed more. This inconsistency might be causing me to miss out on potential gains when the public pot is larger, as well as potentially causing me to lose tokens when the pot is smaller due to under-contributing.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. A high-level plan would be to monitor the average contribution of the other players over the last few rounds and adjust my contribution to be slightly below that average. This way, I can benefit from the public good without over-contributing when others are not. Additionally, I should consider contributing more when the public pot has the potential to yield a higher multiplier, as this could lead to a more favorable payoff.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 1 (you) is contributing tokens to the public pot with varying degrees of success. There seems to be no clear strategy in terms of how many tokens to contribute, as the contributions range from 3 to 9 tokens across the rounds. This inconsistent approach could lead to suboptimal gains, as seen in Round 4 when contributing 9 tokens resulted in a low gain of 1.8 tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more consistent and strategic contribution strategy. One such approach could be to contribute a fixed percentage of your total tokens, say 20%, to the public pot in each round. This would balance the risk of losing too many tokens with the potential for a fair share of the public good payoff. Additionally, observing the average contribution of other players and adjusting your contribution slightly higher or lower to exploit their behavior could also be beneficial. This way, you can adapt to the game dynamics while maintaining a more controlled and calculated approach.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their long-term gain. There seems to be a lack of strategic coordination with other players, as player_1's contributions don't always align with the rounds where other players contribute more, leading to lower payoffs when contributing more tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing more tokens when they observe others contributing more, to capitalize on the higher multiplier. Additionally, they should consider contributing less when others contribute less to avoid losing tokens without a significant public good payoff. By adapting to the average contribution of other players, player_1 can potentially optimize their gains over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been inconsistent, ranging from 2 to 9 tokens per round. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively balance the trade-off between contributing to the public good and retaining tokens for personal gain. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more stable and strategic approach. A high-level plan would be to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens, say 20%, to the public pot in each round. This way, I maintain a consistent strategy while adapting to my changing token balance. Additionally, I should consider the contributions of other players and adjust my strategy if it appears that they are consistently contributing more or less, in order to optimize my gains.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been inconsistent, ranging from 2 to 9 tokens per round. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively balance the trade-off between contributing to the public good and retaining tokens for personal gain. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more stable and strategic approach. A possible high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens, say 30%, to the public pot in each round. This way, I maintain a consistent strategy while adapting to my changing token balance. Additionally, I should consider the contributions of other players, especially if they are consistently contributing more or less, and adjust my strategy accordingly to potentially exploit their behavior.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is inconsistent, alternating between higher and lower contributions without a clear pattern. This inconsistency could be leading to suboptimal gains, as the player is not effectively leveraging the public good multiplier. To mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens or adjusting their contribution based on the average contribution of other players. This way, player_1 can better balance personal gain with the potential benefit from the public pot.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for the player's failure is inconsistent contribution strategies. The player seems to be alternating between contributing more tokens (4 or 5) and contributing fewer tokens (2 or 3). This inconsistency could lead to lower average gains, as the player is not effectively leveraging the public good multiplier. Additionally, there are instances where the player contributes more tokens than the average contribution of other players, resulting in a lower individual payoff due to the even division of the public good.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan would be to adopt a more strategic and adaptive contribution strategy. The player should aim to contribute just enough tokens to ensure their share of the public good is higher than the cost of their contribution, considering the expected contributions of other players. This can be achieved by observing the contribution patterns of other players and adjusting contributions accordingly, while also factoring in the potential for free-riders who contribute less. By doing so, the player can maximize their long-term token accumulation.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for failure or suboptimal performance is that the contribution strategy seems inconsistent. Player 1 has contributed different amounts across the rounds without a clear pattern, which might result from not effectively anticipating the actions of other players or not adapting to the changing situation. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing the minimum amount necessary to ensure a positive return, considering the average contribution of other players. This way, Player 1 can balance between maximizing personal gain and incentivizing others to contribute more to the public pot. Additionally, monitoring the round dynamics and adjusting contributions based on the pot size and other players' behavior could lead to better long-term outcomes.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing tokens. There are instances where player_1 contributes more tokens to the public pot when other players' contributions are lower, leading to a lower individual gain per token contributed. For example, in Round 18, player_1 contributed 5 tokens to a pot of 15, resulting in a low gain of 1 token, while in Round 15, contributing only 2 tokens to a pot of 18 led to a higher gain of 5.2 tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the contributions of other players before deciding how many tokens to contribute. A potential high-level plan is to contribute just enough tokens to ensure the public pot multiplied by 2 is slightly higher than the average number of tokens contributed by all players, plus one. This way, the potential gain from the public good would outweigh the cost of contribution. Additionally, if other players' contributions are consistently low, player_1 should also consider contributing less to minimize losses.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, considering the average contribution of other players. For example, in Round 18, contributing 5 tokens when others contributed 3 or more would have led to a higher multiplier and thus a better payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more adaptive strategy. The new plan is to estimate the average contribution of other players in the previous round and aim to contribute just enough tokens to reach the threshold where the public good multiplier starts to significantly increase. This way, player_1 can balance between maximizing the collective pot and avoiding over-contributing. Additionally, monitoring the token counts of other players can help identify when they are likely to contribute more, prompting player_1 to adjust their contribution accordingly to benefit from a larger pot.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their gains. There seems to be a lack of coordination with other players, as contributions are not always aligned with the highest paying rounds. To mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing more tokens when others are also contributing significantly, to capitalize on the higher multipliers. Additionally, player_1 should consider contributing less when others contribute very little, to avoid losing tokens without a substantial public good payoff. This strategy aims to balance personal gain with the unpredictable behavior of other players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is inconsistent, often deviating from the optimal contribution that would maximize their gain. In several rounds, player_1 contributes more tokens than the average contribution of other players, leading to a lower individual payoff due to the public good being divided equally among all players. For example, in Round 21, player_1 contributed 5 tokens when the average contribution was 4, resulting in a lower gain compared to if they had contributed 4 tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more adaptive strategy, aiming to contribute close to the average contribution of other players in each round. This approach would help to balance the benefits from the public good while minimizing personal losses. Additionally, player_1 should consider the potential for free-riders, who contribute fewer tokens, and adjust their strategy accordingly to not overcontribute and disproportionately benefit others. By monitoring the average contribution and adjusting their own contribution, player_1 can optimize their long-term token accumulation.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing their tokens. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot results in a lower individual gain compared to other players who contributed less. This could be due to underestimating the impact of the total tokens in the pot on the public good payoff or not effectively anticipating the contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the expected contributions of other players and the potential multiplier effect on the public pot. A new high-level plan could be to:\n\n1. Observe the average contribution of other players over the past few rounds and adjust own contribution to maintain a balance between personal gain and group benefit.\n2. If other players are consistently contributing low amounts, consider contributing slightly more to potentially exploit the higher multiplier, but not excessively to avoid being exploited.\n3. If other players are contributing high amounts, match or slightly exceed their contributions to maintain a fair share of the public good payoff.\n4. Continuously update the strategy based on the evolving behavior of other players to adapt to changing dynamics in the game.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is not consistently aligned with maximizing their gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, but player_1 chose to contribute less. For example, in Round 21, contributing 10 tokens instead of 5 would have led to a higher gain due to the high total tokens in the pot that round.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players and the potential for a higher multiplier effect. A new high-level plan could be to:\n\n1. Observe the average contribution of other players in the previous few rounds.\n2. If the average contribution is high, contribute close to the average to maximize the multiplier effect.\n3. If the average contribution is low, consider contributing less to avoid potential free-ridership, as the lower total tokens in the pot will result in a smaller payoff.\n4. Continuously update this strategy based on the changing behavior of other players to adapt to their strategies and optimize individual gains.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is inconsistent, often alternating between higher and lower contributions. This inconsistency could be leading to suboptimal gains, as the player is not fully capitalizing on rounds where contributing more would result in a higher public good payoff. To mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the contributions of other players and aiming to contribute just enough to ensure the public pot multiplier (2) results in a higher total gain than the tokens contributed. By doing so, player_1 can balance personal gain with the collective effort, maximizing overall tokens collected over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is inconsistent, often deviating from the optimal contribution that would maximize their individual gain. In some rounds, player_1 contributes more tokens when it results in a lower personal gain (e.g., Round 10), while in other rounds, they contribute less even when it could lead to a higher gain (e.g., Round 18). This inconsistency could be due to a lack of a clear strategy or an attempt to exploit the behavior of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more consistent and rational strategy. A high-level plan would be to calculate the average contribution of the other players and contribute just enough tokens to reach the point where the public good multiplier (2) would result in a marginal gain equal to or slightly greater than the average contribution. This way, player_1 ensures they are not exploited while also maximizing their individual payoff. Additionally, player_1 should adjust this strategy as the game progresses, considering any observed changes in the behavior of other players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is inconsistent, often alternating between higher and lower contributions. This inconsistency could be leading to suboptimal gains, as the player is not fully capitalizing on rounds where contributing more would result in a higher public pot multiplier. To mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the average contribution of other players and adjusting their own contribution to maximize the benefit from the public good. If other players are contributing consistently, player_1 should aim to match their contributions to ensure a fair share of the multiplied pot, while also being cautious not to overcontribute when others are contributing less.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is inconsistent, often deviating from the optimal contribution that would maximize their gain. In some rounds, player_1 contributes more tokens when others contribute less, while in other rounds, they contribute less when others contribute more. This inconsistent behavior might lead to suboptimal gains compared to other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. A high-level plan could be to monitor the average contribution of the other players and adjust contributions accordingly. If the average contribution is high, player_1 should contribute less to avoid overpaying into the public pot. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_1 should contribute more to take advantage of the higher multiplier on the public good. This way, player_1 can balance their personal gain with the group's dynamics, potentially leading to better overall performance.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly more tokens. To mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the average contribution of other players. If the average contribution is high, player_1 should contribute more to capitalize on the larger public good payoff. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_1 should contribute less to conserve tokens. This way, player_1 can better align their contributions with the potential rewards, leading to a more efficient use of tokens and potentially higher overall gains.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for suboptimal performance is that player_1's contribution strategy seems inconsistent, often deviating from the average contribution of the other players. This inconsistency leads to missed opportunities for higher payoffs when others contribute more and lower gains when contributing more to a lower pot. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more adaptive strategy, where player_1 contributes an amount close to the average contribution of the other players in each round. This approach would help align player_1's actions with the potential for a larger public good and minimize the risk of over-contributing or under-contributing relative to the group.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is inconsistent, often deviating from the optimal contribution that would maximize their gain. In some rounds, player_1 contributes more tokens when others contribute less, and vice versa, which results in suboptimal payoffs. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan should be to adopt a more strategic and predictable approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of tokens based on the average contribution of other players. This way, player_1 can better align their contributions with the potential public good payoff, thus maximizing their gains in the long run.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that the player (player_1) is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their long-term gain. There seems to be a lack of coordination with other players, as contributions are not always aligned with the highest paying rounds. To mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the average contribution of other players and adjusting their own contribution to optimize the balance between personal gain and the public good. If other players are contributing more, player_1 should also contribute more to benefit from the higher multiplier, and conversely, contribute less when others contribute less to avoid free-riding. Additionally, monitoring the tokens of other players can help identify patterns and adjust strategies accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly. For example, in Round 18, contributing 5 tokens instead of 3 would have led to a higher gain, as the pot multiplier was 15, and in Round 21, contributing 10 tokens would have been more beneficial due to the high total contribution from other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A high-level plan could be to:\n\n1. Observe the average contribution of other players in recent rounds.\n2. If the average contribution is high, contribute close to the maximum to take advantage of the larger pot multiplier.\n3. If the average contribution is low, contribute just enough to ensure a positive gain, but not too much to risk a lower payoff when others contribute little.\n4. Continuously update this strategy based on the changing behavior of other players to adapt to their strategies.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly. For example, in Round 35, contributing 5 tokens instead of 3 would have led to a higher payoff due to the higher total in the pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_1 could be to adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the average contribution of other players. If the average contribution of others is high, player_1 should contribute more to capitalize on the larger potential public good payoff. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_1 should contribute less to conserve tokens. Additionally, considering the potential for free-riding when others contribute more, player_1 should also weigh the risk of contributing too much when others contribute little. This adaptive strategy aims to balance risk and reward based on the actions of other players.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, alternating between contributing more tokens (4 or 5) and contributing fewer tokens (3 or 2). This inconsistency could be leading to suboptimal gains, as the player might not be fully capitalizing on the public good multiplier when others contribute more. To mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic and predictable approach. A high-level plan would be to adopt a conditional contribution strategy: contribute the maximum number of tokens (e.g., 5) when the average contribution of other players in the previous round was above a certain threshold (say, 3.5), and contribute a lower amount (e.g., 2) when it was below the threshold. This way, player_1 can potentially benefit more from rounds with higher collective contributions while minimizing losses in rounds with lower contributions.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly. For example, in Round 18, contributing 5 tokens instead of 3 would have led to a higher gain, as the public pot was multiplied by 3 and divided equally among players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A high-level plan could be to contribute tokens equal to the average contribution of the other players plus one, ensuring a fair balance between contributing to the public good and maximizing personal gain. This strategy aims to capitalize on the potential higher multipliers while minimizing the risk of over-contributing when others contribute less. Additionally, player_1 should be prepared to adjust this strategy if other players' behavior changes significantly during the game.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly.

A potential high-level plan is to:\n\n1. Observe the average contribution of other players in the previous few rounds.\n2. If the average contribution is high, contribute close to the average to ensure a fair share of the multiplied public good.\n3. If the average contribution is low, consider contributing less to minimize potential losses if others also contribute minimally.\n4. In rounds where player_1 has significantly more tokens than the average, consider contributing more to potentially create a larger public good and increase overall gains.\n\nThis adaptive strategy aims to balance risk and reward based on the behavior of other players, maximizing the benefit from the public good while minimizing the risk of contributing too much when others contribute little.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that the player (player_1) is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their long-term gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. For example, in Round 18, contributing 5 tokens instead of 3 would have resulted in a higher gain, as the pot was small and the other players' contributions were relatively high.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach to token contribution. This strategy should consider the current round, the total tokens in the public pot, and the average contribution of the other players. If the pot is small and other players are contributing significantly, it might be beneficial to contribute more tokens to take advantage of the higher multiplier. Conversely, if the pot is large and other players are contributing less, it might be wise to contribute less to avoid potential free-riders. By dynamically adjusting contributions based on these factors, player_1 can optimize their overall gain over the remaining rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens across the rounds. This inconsistency might be causing player_1 to miss out on potential gains when other players contribute more tokens to the public pot. To mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens based on the average contribution of the other players. This way, player_1 can better align their contributions with the potential payoff and minimize the risk of under-contributing when the public pot would yield a higher return. Additionally, monitoring the round-by-round trends in other players' contributions could help player_1 adjust their strategy dynamically.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good dynamics. The player seems to contribute less when others contribute more, which might lead to missed opportunities for higher payoffs when the pot is larger.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_1 could be to adopt a more strategic and predictable contribution pattern. One such strategy is to contribute a fixed percentage of their tokens, say 40%, in each round. This way, player_1 would consistently contribute regardless of other players' actions, potentially benefiting more from the multiplied public pot when others also contribute. Additionally, this strategy would reduce the impact of emotional or reactive decision-making and create a more stable long-term performance.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 1's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could lead to suboptimal gains, as the player is not fully capitalizing on the potential benefits of the public good when others contribute more. To mitigate this failure, Player 1 should adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. A high-level plan would be to monitor the average contribution of the other players and contribute slightly more than that average to benefit from the multiplier effect while ensuring a fair share of the public good payoff. This way, Player 1 can potentially increase gains when others contribute significantly and minimize losses when contributions are low.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, ranging from 2 to 5 tokens across the rounds. This inconsistency might be causing player_1 to miss out on potential gains when other players contribute more tokens to the public pot. A possible reason for this behavior could be a lack of anticipation or adaptation to the contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as monitoring the average contribution of other players and adjusting their own contribution to be closer to that average. This way, player_1 can benefit more from the public good when others also contribute significantly, while minimizing losses when others contribute less. Additionally, player_1 could consider contributing slightly more when the pot has the potential to yield a higher multiplier (when more tokens are contributed in total), to capitalize on the larger payout.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good dynamics. The player seems to contribute more tokens when others do, but not consistently enough to maximize gains when others contribute less.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_1 could be to adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. This could involve monitoring the average contribution of the other players and contributing just enough to ensure the public pot multiplier (2) is reached or slightly exceeded, while not over-contributing. For instance, if the average contribution of others is 3 tokens, player_1 could contribute 2 tokens to ensure a total of 6 tokens in the pot, which would still result in a 2x multiplier. This way, player_1 can balance between contributing to the public good and preserving private tokens. Additionally, if others consistently contribute more, player_1 could occasionally match their contributions to maintain a fair share of the payoff.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good dynamics. The player seems to contribute more tokens when others do, but not always, which might lead to missed opportunities for higher payoffs when others contribute more.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_1 could be to adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. This could involve observing the average contribution of other players over the previous few rounds and contributing slightly more than that average to potentially benefit from the multiplied public good while still benefiting from others' contributions. Additionally, player_1 should consider contributing more when the public pot has a higher chance of resulting in a higher payoff, such as when other players have been consistently contributing more tokens. This way, player_1 can better align their contributions with the potential for higher rewards.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens.

To mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens based on the average contribution of the other players. This would allow for a more adaptive strategy that maximizes gains when others contribute more, while minimizing losses when they contribute less. Additionally, player_1 should consider contributing slightly more when the potential for a higher public good payoff is evident, as seen when multiple players contribute 4 or 5 tokens.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a result of not effectively anticipating the contributions of other players or not having a clear long-term strategy. To mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more consistent strategy, such as always contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens, say 40%, to the public pot. This would balance risk and reward while minimizing the impact of unpredictable fluctuations in contribution decisions. Additionally, player_1 should consider adjusting their contribution based on the average contribution of the previous round to exploit any cooperative or selfish tendencies among the other players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 1's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good dynamics. The player seems to contribute more tokens when others contribute more, but not consistently enough to maximize gains when others contribute less.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 1 should adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of tokens based on the average contribution of the previous round. For example, Player 1 could contribute 1.2 times the average contribution of all players in the previous round. This strategy would allow for a balanced response to the actions of other players, ensuring a more consistent gain and potentially better overall performance. Additionally, it would encourage cooperation if others also adopt similar adaptive strategies.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 1 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some consistency, but not always in line with the highest contributions made by other players. This has led to missed opportunities for higher payoffs when others contribute more tokens. In some rounds, my contribution is lower than the average contribution, which might result in a lower share of the public good.\n\nTo mitigate this, I should adopt a more strategic approach. I should aim to contribute tokens in line with the average contribution of other players to maximize the potential multiplication factor. Additionally, I should consider adjusting my contribution based on the round's context, such as when I sense a higher likelihood of others contributing more tokens. This way, I can balance my personal gain with the potential for a larger public pot, ensuring a more optimal outcome in the long run.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a result of not effectively anticipating the collective contributions of other players or not having a clear long-term strategy. To mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more consistent strategy, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens based on the average contribution of previous rounds.

This way, player_1 can balance the risk of over-contributing when others contribute little with the potential for higher gains when others contribute more. Additionally, considering the total tokens and the stage of the game can help prevent excessive risk-taking towards the end when the number of remaining rounds is limited.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens.

This way, player_1 can ensure a fair share of the public good while minimizing personal costs when others contribute less. Additionally, player_1 should consider contributing more when the potential payoff from the public pot is higher (when others contribute more), and less when the pot is expected to be smaller to conserve tokens.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 1 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their gains. There seems to be no clear pattern in their contribution decisions, which results in missed opportunities for higher payoffs when other players contribute more tokens. To mitigate this failure, Player 1 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing tokens when the average contribution of other players is high, to take advantage of the 2x multiplier and ensure a larger share of the public good payoff. Additionally, Player 1 should consider occasionally contributing less when others contribute very little to avoid free-rider scenarios where they subsidize others' gains without adequate return.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. For example, in Round 21, contributing 10 tokens led to a significantly higher gain than the average contribution of 5 tokens. However, in Round 22, contributing 3 tokens when others contributed more led to a lower gain than if player_1 had contributed more.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the contributions of other players. If the majority of other players are contributing more tokens, player_1 should also contribute more to take advantage of the larger public pot. Conversely, if others are contributing fewer tokens, player_1 should contribute less to avoid over-contributing and potentially receiving a lower payoff per token contributed. This dynamic adjustment strategy will help align player_1's contributions with the potential for higher payoffs.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their gains. There seems to be a lack of strategic adaptation to the varying contributions of other players. To mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more dynamic strategy, such as contributing tokens to match or slightly exceed the average contribution of the other players. This would help ensure a fair share of the public good payoff while minimizing personal losses. Additionally, player_1 should consider contributing more when others contribute significantly more, as this can lead to a higher multiplier on the public pot and potentially larger gains.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 1's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with a tendency to contribute less when other players contribute more and vice versa. This approach might lead to missed opportunities for higher payoffs when the public pot is larger due to higher contributions from others. To mitigate this failure, Player 1 should adopt a more strategic and stable contribution pattern, such as consistently contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens or following a Tit-for-Tat strategy, where they match the average contribution of the previous round. This way, Player 1 can better align with the group's dynamics and potentially maximize their gains.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their gains. There seems to be a lack of strategic coordination with other players, as player_1's contributions don't always align with the higher-contributing rounds, leading to missed opportunities for larger payoffs. To mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing more tokens when others are also contributing significantly, to capitalize on the larger multipliers. Additionally, monitoring the average contribution of other players and adjusting contributions accordingly can help optimize the balance between personal gain and cooperation.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their gains. There seems to be a lack of strategic adaptation to the varying contributions of other players. To improve, player_1 should adopt a more dynamic strategy, considering the average contribution of other players in each round and adjust their own contribution to optimize the balance between personal gain and the public good. For instance, when others contribute more, player_1 should also contribute more to benefit from the higher multiplier, and conversely, contribute less when others contribute less to minimize potential losses. This way, player_1 can better align their actions with the potential payoffs and enhance their overall token accumulation.\n\n```"

      "learnings": "Reflections:\n-Upon reviewing the historical data from Round 1, a possible reason for failure or suboptimal performance is that some players contributed more tokens than others, leading to an unequal distribution of the \"public good\" payoff. In this case, Player 5 contributed the most tokens (8) but did not receive a proportionally higher share of the payoff. This could indicate a lack of coordination or strategic thinking among the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more cooperative strategy, where all players agree to contribute an equal number of tokens to the public pot in each round. This would ensure a more equitable distribution of the public good payoff and potentially maximize the collective gain. To implement this plan, I would need to communicate with the other players and establish a level of trust to ensure they also follow the agreed-upon strategy.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data provided, it appears that players are contributing varying amounts of tokens to the public pot. In Round 1, you contributed 5 tokens, while in Round 2, you contributed 4 tokens. The public good payoff is determined by the total tokens in the pot multiplied by 2, and then evenly divided among all players. Your gains in both rounds were slightly above the average contribution, suggesting that some players might be contributing more than others, while you are contributing slightly less.\n\nA possible reason for failure or suboptimal performance is not adapting your contribution strategy based on the actions of other players. If others consistently contribute more, you could be leaving potential gains on the table by contributing less.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more cooperative strategy, where you aim to contribute an amount close to the average contribution of other players. This way, you can potentially benefit from the higher public good payoff without excessively depleting your private tokens. Additionally, monitoring the pattern of other players' contributions and adjusting your strategy accordingly can lead to better overall performance.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the players, including myself, are contributing varying amounts of tokens to the public pot. In Round 1, the average contribution was high, leading to a larger public good payoff. However, in Round 2 and Round 3, the average contribution decreased, resulting in lower payoffs. The inconsistency in players' contributions might be due to strategic adjustments or uncertainty about the optimal contribution level.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my strategy, I should adopt a more consistent approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens to the public pot in each round, say 40%, which balances risk and reward. This way, I can maintain a stable strategy regardless of other players' actions, and potentially exploit their fluctuations if they continue to vary their contributions. Additionally, this strategy might encourage others to contribute more if they perceive my contribution as reliable, thus increasing the public good for all.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been inconsistent. In Round 1, I contributed 5 tokens, then 4 tokens in Round 2, 5 tokens in Round 3, and 9 tokens in Round 4. This inconsistency could lead to unpredictable payoffs and might not optimize my long-term gain. A possible reason for this failure is the lack of a clear, systematic approach to deciding how many tokens to contribute.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose a new high-level plan: adopt a more stable and strategic contribution level, such as contributing a fixed percentage of my tokens or using a tit-for-tat approach where I match the average contribution of other players in the previous round. This would provide a more consistent strategy and potentially lead to better overall payoffs. Additionally, I should consider the potential for free-riding, where others might contribute less while still benefiting from the public good, and adjust my strategy accordingly to balance cooperation and self-interest.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been inconsistent. In Round 4, I contributed significantly more tokens (9) than in the other rounds (ranging from 4 to 5), which resulted in a lower gain due to the public pot being multiplied by a factor of 2. This suggests that contributing more tokens does not necessarily lead to a proportionally higher individual gain when other players' contributions are taken into account.\n\nTo mitigate this inconsistent strategy and potentially optimize my gains, I should adopt a more balanced and strategic approach. A possible high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens, say 20%, to the public pot in each round. This would ensure a consistent strategy while also allowing me to retain a majority of my tokens for potential future gains. Additionally, I should consider the contributions of other players, especially if they consistently contribute more, as that might indicate a more effective strategy that I should adapt to.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been inconsistent, alternating between contributing 4 and 5 tokens in most rounds. This inconsistency might be causing me to miss out on potential higher payoffs when other players contribute more tokens to the public pot. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the average contribution of other players. If the average contribution is higher in previous rounds, I should contribute more to maximize the public good payoff. Conversely, if others contribute less, I should also contribute less to conserve my tokens. This way, I can better align my contributions with the potential benefits and minimize losses.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been inconsistent, alternating between contributing 4 and 5 tokens in most rounds.

Conversely, if others contribute less, I should also contribute less to conserve my tokens. This way, I can better align my contributions with the potential benefits, leading to a more efficient use of my resources.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been somewhat inconsistent. In some rounds, I contributed more tokens when others did as well, while in other rounds, I contributed less. This inconsistency might be causing me to miss out on potential gains when others contribute more, and it could also signal to other players that my strategy is unpredictable, potentially leading them to exploit my behavior.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more consistent and adaptive strategy. A possible high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens to the public pot in each round, say 40%, which is a balance between risk and reward. This way, I maintain a stable pattern while still benefiting from the public good. Additionally, I should monitor the average contribution of other players and adjust my percentage slightly if their contributions consistently increase or decrease, ensuring I remain competitive without being overly exploited.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been somewhat inconsistent. In some rounds, I contributed more tokens when others did the same, while in others, I contributed less. This inconsistency might be causing me to miss out on potential gains when others contribute more, or lose tokens when I contribute more and others contribute less. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. A high-level plan could be to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens based on the average contribution of the other players in the previous round. This way, I can align my contributions with the group's behavior, potentially maximizing my gains while minimizing losses. Additionally, I should consider contributing more when the public pot can result in a higher multiplier, ensuring a better return on investment.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been somewhat inconsistent, alternating between contributing 4 and 5 tokens in most rounds. This inconsistency might be causing me to miss out on potential gains when other players contribute more tokens to the public pot. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. I propose a plan to monitor the average contribution of other players and adjust my contribution to be slightly below that average, ensuring I benefit from their contributions while not over-contributing. This way, I can balance risk and reward more effectively and potentially increase my overall token count.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that optimizes their gains. There seems to be a lack of strategic coordination with other players, as player_1's contributions don't always align with the highest payoffs. To mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing tokens when the expected public good payoff is higher than the average contribution, or when it is likely that others will contribute significantly, thus maximizing the multiplication factor. Additionally, player_1 should consider the potential for free-riding behavior in others and adjust their contributions accordingly to avoid over-contributing when others are likely to contribute less.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been somewhat inconsistent. In some rounds, I contributed more tokens when others contributed less, while in other rounds, I contributed less when others contributed more. This inconsistency might be causing me to miss out on potential gains when the public pot is larger, as well as potentially causing me to lose tokens when the pot is smaller due to under-contributing.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. A high-level plan would be to monitor the average contribution of the other players over the last few rounds and adjust my contribution to be slightly below that average. This way, I can benefit from the public good without over-contributing when others are not. Additionally, I should consider contributing more when the public pot has the potential to yield a higher multiplier, as this could lead to a more favorable payoff.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 1 (you) is contributing tokens to the public pot with varying degrees of success. There seems to be no clear strategy in terms of how many tokens to contribute, as the contributions range from 3 to 9 tokens across the rounds. This inconsistent approach could lead to suboptimal gains, as seen in Round 4 when contributing 9 tokens resulted in a low gain of 1.8 tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more consistent and strategic contribution strategy. One such approach could be to contribute a fixed percentage of your total tokens, say 20%, to the public pot in each round. This would balance the risk of losing too many tokens with the potential for a fair share of the public good payoff. Additionally, observing the average contribution of other players and adjusting your contribution slightly higher or lower to exploit their behavior could also be beneficial. This way, you can adapt to the game dynamics while maintaining a more controlled and calculated approach.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their long-term gain. There seems to be a lack of strategic coordination with other players, as player_1's contributions don't always align with the rounds where other players contribute more, leading to lower payoffs when contributing more tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing more tokens when they observe others contributing more, to capitalize on the higher multiplier. Additionally, they should consider contributing less when others contribute less to avoid losing tokens without a significant public good payoff. By adapting to the average contribution of other players, player_1 can potentially optimize their gains over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been inconsistent, ranging from 2 to 9 tokens per round. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively balance the trade-off between contributing to the public good and retaining tokens for personal gain. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more stable and strategic approach. A high-level plan would be to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens, say 20%, to the public pot in each round. This way, I maintain a consistent strategy while adapting to my changing token balance. Additionally, I should consider the contributions of other players and adjust my strategy if it appears that they are consistently contributing more or less, in order to optimize my gains.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been inconsistent, ranging from 2 to 9 tokens per round. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively balance the trade-off between contributing to the public good and retaining tokens for personal gain. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more stable and strategic approach. A possible high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens, say 30%, to the public pot in each round. This way, I maintain a consistent strategy while adapting to my changing token balance. Additionally, I should consider the contributions of other players, especially if they are consistently contributing more or less, and adjust my strategy accordingly to potentially exploit their behavior.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is inconsistent, alternating between higher and lower contributions without a clear pattern. This inconsistency could be leading to suboptimal gains, as the player is not effectively leveraging the public good multiplier. To mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens or adjusting their contribution based on the average contribution of other players. This way, player_1 can better balance personal gain with the potential benefit from the public pot.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for the player's failure is inconsistent contribution strategies. The player seems to be alternating between contributing more tokens (4 or 5) and contributing fewer tokens (2 or 3). This inconsistency could lead to lower average gains, as the player is not effectively leveraging the public good multiplier. Additionally, there are instances where the player contributes more tokens than the average contribution of other players, resulting in a lower individual payoff due to the even division of the public good.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan would be to adopt a more strategic and adaptive contribution strategy. The player should aim to contribute just enough tokens to ensure their share of the public good is higher than the cost of their contribution, considering the expected contributions of other players. This can be achieved by observing the contribution patterns of other players and adjusting contributions accordingly, while also factoring in the potential for free-riders who contribute less. By doing so, the player can maximize their long-term token accumulation.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for failure or suboptimal performance is that the contribution strategy seems inconsistent. Player 1 has contributed different amounts across the rounds without a clear pattern, which might result from not effectively anticipating the actions of other players or not adapting to the changing situation. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing the minimum amount necessary to ensure a positive return, considering the average contribution of other players. This way, Player 1 can balance between maximizing personal gain and incentivizing others to contribute more to the public pot. Additionally, monitoring the round dynamics and adjusting contributions based on the pot size and other players' behavior could lead to better long-term outcomes.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing tokens. There are instances where player_1 contributes more tokens to the public pot when other players' contributions are lower, leading to a lower individual gain per token contributed. For example, in Round 18, player_1 contributed 5 tokens to a pot of 15, resulting in a low gain of 1 token, while in Round 15, contributing only 2 tokens to a pot of 18 led to a higher gain of 5.2 tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the contributions of other players before deciding how many tokens to contribute. A potential high-level plan is to contribute just enough tokens to ensure the public pot multiplied by 2 is slightly higher than the average number of tokens contributed by all players, plus one. This way, the potential gain from the public good would outweigh the cost of contribution. Additionally, if other players' contributions are consistently low, player_1 should also consider contributing less to minimize losses.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, considering the average contribution of other players. For example, in Round 18, contributing 5 tokens when others contributed 3 or more would have led to a higher multiplier and thus a better payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more adaptive strategy. The new plan is to estimate the average contribution of other players in the previous round and aim to contribute just enough tokens to reach the threshold where the public good multiplier starts to significantly increase. This way, player_1 can balance between maximizing the collective pot and avoiding over-contributing. Additionally, monitoring the token counts of other players can help identify when they are likely to contribute more, prompting player_1 to adjust their contribution accordingly to benefit from a larger pot.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their gains. There seems to be a lack of coordination with other players, as contributions are not always aligned with the highest paying rounds. To mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing more tokens when others are also contributing significantly, to capitalize on the higher multipliers. Additionally, player_1 should consider contributing less when others contribute very little, to avoid losing tokens without a substantial public good payoff. This strategy aims to balance personal gain with the unpredictable behavior of other players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is inconsistent, often deviating from the optimal contribution that would maximize their gain. In several rounds, player_1 contributes more tokens than the average contribution of other players, leading to a lower individual payoff due to the public good being divided equally among all players. For example, in Round 21, player_1 contributed 5 tokens when the average contribution was 4, resulting in a lower gain compared to if they had contributed 4 tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more adaptive strategy, aiming to contribute close to the average contribution of other players in each round. This approach would help to balance the benefits from the public good while minimizing personal losses. Additionally, player_1 should consider the potential for free-riders, who contribute fewer tokens, and adjust their strategy accordingly to not overcontribute and disproportionately benefit others. By monitoring the average contribution and adjusting their own contribution, player_1 can optimize their long-term token accumulation.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing their tokens. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot results in a lower individual gain compared to other players who contributed less. This could be due to underestimating the impact of the total tokens in the pot on the public good payoff or not effectively anticipating the contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the expected contributions of other players and the potential multiplier effect on the public pot. A new high-level plan could be to:\n\n1. Observe the average contribution of other players over the past few rounds and adjust own contribution to maintain a balance between personal gain and group benefit.\n2. If other players are consistently contributing low amounts, consider contributing slightly more to potentially exploit the higher multiplier, but not excessively to avoid being exploited.\n3. If other players are contributing high amounts, match or slightly exceed their contributions to maintain a fair share of the public good payoff.\n4. Continuously update the strategy based on the evolving behavior of other players to adapt to changing dynamics in the game.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is not consistently aligned with maximizing their gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, but player_1 chose to contribute less. For example, in Round 21, contributing 10 tokens instead of 5 would have led to a higher gain due to the high total tokens in the pot that round.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players and the potential for a higher multiplier effect. A new high-level plan could be to:\n\n1. Observe the average contribution of other players in the previous few rounds.\n2. If the average contribution is high, contribute close to the average to maximize the multiplier effect.\n3. If the average contribution is low, consider contributing less to avoid potential free-ridership, as the lower total tokens in the pot will result in a smaller payoff.\n4. Continuously update this strategy based on the changing behavior of other players to adapt to their strategies and optimize individual gains.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is inconsistent, often alternating between higher and lower contributions. This inconsistency could be leading to suboptimal gains, as the player is not fully capitalizing on rounds where contributing more would result in a higher public good payoff. To mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the contributions of other players and aiming to contribute just enough to ensure the public pot multiplier (2) results in a higher total gain than the tokens contributed. By doing so, player_1 can balance personal gain with the collective effort, maximizing overall tokens collected over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is inconsistent, often deviating from the optimal contribution that would maximize their individual gain. In some rounds, player_1 contributes more tokens when it results in a lower personal gain (e.g., Round 10), while in other rounds, they contribute less even when it could lead to a higher gain (e.g., Round 18). This inconsistency could be due to a lack of a clear strategy or an attempt to exploit the behavior of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more consistent and rational strategy. A high-level plan would be to calculate the average contribution of the other players and contribute just enough tokens to reach the point where the public good multiplier (2) would result in a marginal gain equal to or slightly greater than the average contribution. This way, player_1 ensures they are not exploited while also maximizing their individual payoff. Additionally, player_1 should adjust this strategy as the game progresses, considering any observed changes in the behavior of other players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is inconsistent, often alternating between higher and lower contributions. This inconsistency could be leading to suboptimal gains, as the player is not fully capitalizing on rounds where contributing more would result in a higher public pot multiplier. To mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the average contribution of other players and adjusting their own contribution to maximize the benefit from the public good. If other players are contributing consistently, player_1 should aim to match their contributions to ensure a fair share of the multiplied pot, while also being cautious not to overcontribute when others are contributing less.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is inconsistent, often deviating from the optimal contribution that would maximize their gain. In some rounds, player_1 contributes more tokens when others contribute less, while in other rounds, they contribute less when others contribute more. This inconsistent behavior might lead to suboptimal gains compared to other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. A high-level plan could be to monitor the average contribution of the other players and adjust contributions accordingly. If the average contribution is high, player_1 should contribute less to avoid overpaying into the public pot. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_1 should contribute more to take advantage of the higher multiplier on the public good. This way, player_1 can balance their personal gain with the group's dynamics, potentially leading to better overall performance.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly more tokens.

If the average contribution is high, player_1 should contribute more to capitalize on the larger public good payoff. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_1 should contribute less to conserve tokens. This way, player_1 can better align their contributions with the potential rewards, leading to a more efficient use of tokens and potentially higher overall gains.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for suboptimal performance is that player_1's contribution strategy seems inconsistent, often deviating from the average contribution of the other players. This inconsistency leads to missed opportunities for higher payoffs when others contribute more and lower gains when contributing more to a lower pot. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more adaptive strategy, where player_1 contributes an amount close to the average contribution of the other players in each round. This approach would help align player_1's actions with the potential for a larger public good and minimize the risk of over-contributing or under-contributing relative to the group.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is inconsistent, often deviating from the optimal contribution that would maximize their gain. In some rounds, player_1 contributes more tokens when others contribute less, and vice versa, which results in suboptimal payoffs. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan should be to adopt a more strategic and predictable approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of tokens based on the average contribution of other players. This way, player_1 can better align their contributions with the potential public good payoff, thus maximizing their gains in the long run.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that the player (player_1) is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their long-term gain.

To mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the average contribution of other players and adjusting their own contribution to optimize the balance between personal gain and the public good. If other players are contributing more, player_1 should also contribute more to benefit from the higher multiplier, and conversely, contribute less when others contribute less to avoid free-riding. Additionally, monitoring the tokens of other players can help identify patterns and adjust strategies accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly. For example, in Round 18, contributing 5 tokens instead of 3 would have led to a higher gain, as the pot multiplier was 15, and in Round 21, contributing 10 tokens would have been more beneficial due to the high total contribution from other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A high-level plan could be to:\n\n1. Observe the average contribution of other players in recent rounds.\n2. If the average contribution is high, contribute close to the maximum to take advantage of the larger pot multiplier.\n3. If the average contribution is low, contribute just enough to ensure a positive gain, but not too much to risk a lower payoff when others contribute little.\n4. Continuously update this strategy based on the changing behavior of other players to adapt to their strategies.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly. For example, in Round 35, contributing 5 tokens instead of 3 would have led to a higher payoff due to the higher total in the pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_1 could be to adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the average contribution of other players. If the average contribution of others is high, player_1 should contribute more to capitalize on the larger potential public good payoff. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_1 should contribute less to conserve tokens. Additionally, considering the potential for free-riding when others contribute more, player_1 should also weigh the risk of contributing too much when others contribute little. This adaptive strategy aims to balance risk and reward based on the actions of other players.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, alternating between contributing more tokens (4 or 5) and contributing fewer tokens (3 or 2). This inconsistency could be leading to suboptimal gains, as the player might not be fully capitalizing on the public good multiplier when others contribute more. To mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic and predictable approach. A high-level plan would be to adopt a conditional contribution strategy: contribute the maximum number of tokens (e.g., 5) when the average contribution of other players in the previous round was above a certain threshold (say, 3.5), and contribute a lower amount (e.g., 2) when it was below the threshold. This way, player_1 can potentially benefit more from rounds with higher collective contributions while minimizing losses in rounds with lower contributions.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly. For example, in Round 18, contributing 5 tokens instead of 3 would have led to a higher gain, as the public pot was multiplied by 3 and divided equally among players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A high-level plan could be to contribute tokens equal to the average contribution of the other players plus one, ensuring a fair balance between contributing to the public good and maximizing personal gain. This strategy aims to capitalize on the potential higher multipliers while minimizing the risk of over-contributing when others contribute less. Additionally, player_1 should be prepared to adjust this strategy if other players' behavior changes significantly during the game.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly.

A potential high-level plan is to:\n\n1. Observe the average contribution of other players in the previous few rounds.\n2. If the average contribution is high, contribute close to the average to ensure a fair share of the multiplied public good.\n3. If the average contribution is low, consider contributing less to minimize potential losses if others also contribute minimally.\n4. In rounds where player_1 has significantly more tokens than the average, consider contributing more to potentially create a larger public good and increase overall gains.\n\nThis adaptive strategy aims to balance risk and reward based on the behavior of other players, maximizing the benefit from the public good while minimizing the risk of contributing too much when others contribute little.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that the player (player_1) is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their long-term gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. For example, in Round 18, contributing 5 tokens instead of 3 would have resulted in a higher gain, as the pot was small and the other players' contributions were relatively high.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach to token contribution. This strategy should consider the current round, the total tokens in the public pot, and the average contribution of the other players. If the pot is small and other players are contributing significantly, it might be beneficial to contribute more tokens to take advantage of the higher multiplier. Conversely, if the pot is large and other players are contributing less, it might be wise to contribute less to avoid potential free-riders. By dynamically adjusting contributions based on these factors, player_1 can optimize their overall gain over the remaining rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens across the rounds. This inconsistency might be causing player_1 to miss out on potential gains when other players contribute more tokens to the public pot. To mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens based on the average contribution of the other players. This way, player_1 can better align their contributions with the potential payoff and minimize the risk of under-contributing when the public pot would yield a higher return. Additionally, monitoring the round-by-round trends in other players' contributions could help player_1 adjust their strategy dynamically.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good dynamics. The player seems to contribute less when others contribute more, which might lead to missed opportunities for higher payoffs when the pot is larger.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_1 could be to adopt a more strategic and predictable contribution pattern. One such strategy is to contribute a fixed percentage of their tokens, say 40%, in each round. This way, player_1 would consistently contribute regardless of other players' actions, potentially benefiting more from the multiplied public pot when others also contribute. Additionally, this strategy would reduce the impact of emotional or reactive decision-making and create a more stable long-term performance.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 1's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens.

To mitigate this failure, Player 1 should adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. A high-level plan would be to monitor the average contribution of the other players and contribute slightly more than that average to benefit from the multiplier effect while ensuring a fair share of the public good payoff.

This could involve monitoring the average contribution of the other players and contributing just enough to ensure the public pot multiplier (2) is reached or slightly exceeded, while not over-contributing. For instance, if the average contribution of others is 3 tokens, player_1 could contribute 2 tokens to ensure a total of 6 tokens in the pot, which would still result in a 2x multiplier. This way, player_1 can balance between contributing to the public good and preserving private tokens. Additionally, if others consistently contribute more, player_1 could occasionally match their contributions to maintain a fair share of the payoff.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens.

This inconsistency could be a result of not effectively anticipating the contributions of other players or not having a clear long-term strategy. To mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more consistent strategy, such as always contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens, say 40%, to the public pot. This would balance risk and reward while minimizing the impact of unpredictable fluctuations in contribution decisions. Additionally, player_1 should consider adjusting their contribution based on the average contribution of the previous round to exploit any cooperative or selfish tendencies among the other players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 1's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens.

A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of tokens based on the average contribution of the previous round. For example, Player 1 could contribute 1.2 times the average contribution of all players in the previous round. This strategy would allow for a balanced response to the actions of other players, ensuring a more consistent gain and potentially better overall performance. Additionally, it would encourage cooperation if others also adopt similar adaptive strategies.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 1 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some consistency, but not always in line with the highest contributions made by other players. This has led to missed opportunities for higher payoffs when others contribute more tokens. In some rounds, my contribution is lower than the average contribution, which might result in a lower share of the public good.\n\nTo mitigate this, I should adopt a more strategic approach. I should aim to contribute tokens in line with the average contribution of other players to maximize the potential multiplication factor. Additionally, I should consider adjusting my contribution based on the round's context, such as when I sense a higher likelihood of others contributing more tokens. This way, I can balance my personal gain with the potential for a larger public pot, ensuring a more optimal outcome in the long run.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_1's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens.

However, in Round 22, contributing 3 tokens when others contributed more led to a lower gain than if player_1 had contributed more.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_1 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the contributions of other players. If the majority of other players are contributing more tokens, player_1 should also contribute more to take advantage of the larger public pot.

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-Upon reviewing the historical data from Round 1, a possible reason for failure or suboptimal performance is that some players, including myself as player_2, contributed more tokens than others without receiving a proportionally higher benefit. In this case, I contributed 6 tokens, which is above the average contribution, but the public good payoff was evenly divided among all players, resulting in a similar gain for everyone. This situation can lead to free-riding, where players might contribute less in future rounds to maximize their individual tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan is to adopt a more strategic and selfish approach in the short term. I should aim to contribute just enough tokens to ensure the public pot is not empty, as a minimum contribution is still beneficial due to the 2x multiplier. However, I should also monitor the contributions of other players and adjust my contribution to be slightly below the average, to avoid over-contributing while still benefiting from the public good. This strategy will help balance my individual gain with the collective effort, reducing the risk of being a disproportionate contributor.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data provided, it appears that the players are contributing varying amounts of tokens to the public pot. In Round 1, the average contribution was high (5.6 tokens), while in Round 2, it was lower (5 tokens). The discrepancy in player contributions might lead to inconsistent payoffs and potentially less optimal outcomes for all players. To mitigate this issue, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more consistent contribution strategy, such as contributing a fixed percentage of one's tokens in each round. This would ensure a more predictable payoff and reduce the impact of other players' variable contributions. Additionally, monitoring the average contribution of other players and adjusting one's strategy accordingly could also be beneficial to optimize gains while minimizing risks.\nReflections:\n-Upon reviewing the historical data from the first three rounds, a pattern emerges where the players, including myself as player_2, are contributing varying amounts of tokens to the public pot. In Round 1, the contributions were relatively high, while in Round 2 and Round 3, they decreased. This inconsistency could be due to each player trying to optimize their individual gains by adjusting their contributions based on others' actions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my strategy, I should adopt a more consistent approach that balances my contributions with the potential benefits. A possible high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens, say 20%, to the public pot in each round. This way, I can maintain a stable strategy while minimizing the risk of exploitation by other players who might notice and exploit my changing contribution patterns. Additionally, this approach encourages cooperation by consistently investing in the public good without being overly sensitive to short-term fluctuations in others' contributions.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) is contributing less tokens to the public pot compared to some other players, particularly in Round 2 and Round 4. This conservative strategy might be resulting in lower potential gains when other players contribute more. The discrepancy could be due to an attempt to conserve tokens for future rounds or a misjudgment of the optimal contribution level.\n\nTo mitigate this potential failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A new high-level plan would be to calculate the average contribution of all players in the previous round and contribute slightly above that average to encourage others to contribute more while still benefiting from the public good. This way, I can balance between personal gain and contributing to the group's success. Additionally, I should consider adjusting my contribution based on the current token balance to ensure long-term sustainability.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2 is contributing tokens to the public pot with varying levels of consistency. In Round 1, they contributed 6 tokens, then 5 tokens in Round 2, 4 tokens in Round 3, 3 tokens in Round 4, and 6 tokens again in Round 5.

There seems to be a lack of coordination with other players, as my contributions don't always align with the highest paying off actions. In some rounds, I contribute more tokens when others contribute less, leading to a lower individual gain due to the public good being multiplied by a lower total.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute tokens in a way that balances personal gain with the potential for a higher public good. This can be achieved by observing the average contribution of other players and contributing slightly more than that average to potentially benefit from a larger multiplier without over-contributing. Additionally, I should consider the potential for free-riders, who contribute less while benefiting from others' contributions, and adjust my strategy accordingly to avoid being exploited.\nReflections:\n-Upon reviewing the historical data, a pattern emerges in player_2's contributions. In rounds where player_2 contributes more tokens to the public pot, the individual gain is not consistently higher than when contributing fewer tokens. This could be due to the variability in other players' contributions, which affects the total pot and the resulting payoff. To mitigate this issue, a new high-level plan is to adopt a more strategic approach: contribute tokens to the public pot when the expected gain is higher than the cost of contribution, which can be estimated by observing the average contributions of other players. If others tend to contribute more, it's beneficial to contribute more as well; if they contribute less, it's better to conserve tokens. This way, player_2 can balance risk and reward more effectively.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) is contributing tokens to the public pot with some inconsistency. There seems to be no clear strategy in terms of how many tokens are contributed, as the contributions range from 3 to 9 tokens across the first 10 rounds. This inconsistent contribution pattern could lead to suboptimal gains, as I am not effectively leveraging the 2x multiplier for the public good.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose adopting a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my current tokens to the public pot in each round. For example, I could contribute 20% of my tokens, which would allow me to balance participation in the public good while retaining enough tokens for future rounds. This consistent strategy should lead to more predictable gains and better overall performance in the game. Additionally, I should also consider adjusting this percentage based on the contributions of other players, if that information is available, to maximize the benefit from the public good.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for failure or suboptimal performance is that Player 2 is not consistently contributing the optimal number of tokens to maximize their gains. There seems to be no clear pattern in their contributions, which results in fluctuating gains. In some rounds, they contribute more tokens when it might not be beneficial (e.g., Round 1 with 6 tokens), while in other rounds, they contribute less when contributing more could lead to a higher payoff (e.g., Round 4 with 3 tokens when others contributed more).\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic approach. A high-level plan could be to contribute tokens based on the average contribution of the other players. If the average contribution is high, Player 2 should contribute close to that average to benefit from the larger public good. If the average is low, contributing less might be more beneficial to avoid losing tokens without a significant public good payoff. Additionally, Player 2 should consider the potential for free-ridership, where others might contribute less while still benefiting from the public good, and adjust their strategy accordingly to not overcontribute.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that optimizes their long-term gain. There seems to be a lack of strategic coordination with other players, as contributions are not aligned with the patterns of other players, leading to variable payoffs. To mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing tokens when the expected public good payoff is higher (when others are likely to contribute more) or using a tit-for-tat strategy, where they match the average contribution of the previous round.

A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens to the public pot in each round, such as 40%, which would balance risk and reward while maintaining consistency. This way, I can better predict my potential gains and minimize the impact of other players' contributions on my strategy. Additionally, I should monitor the average contribution of other players and adjust my percentage slightly if their behavior suggests a more cooperative or selfish approach.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that optimizes their long-term gain. There seems to be a lack of strategic coordination with other players, as contributions are not aligned with the patterns of other players. This leads to fluctuating gains and occasionally lower returns when contributing more tokens while others contribute less.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the contributions of other players. A potential high-level plan is to contribute tokens equal to the average contribution of the other players in the previous round, with adjustments based on the total tokens in the pot. This strategy aims to balance personal gain with the group's collective effort, ensuring a more stable increase in tokens over time. Additionally, if the average contribution decreases significantly, it might be beneficial to contribute less to avoid exploitation by free-riding players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes individual gain. There seems to be a lack of coordination with other players, as contributions are not always aligned with the optimal strategy for a given round. In some rounds, contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose a new high-level plan: adopt a more strategic and adaptive contribution strategy. This would involve observing the average contribution of other players in previous rounds and adjusting my contribution to be slightly below that average, to take advantage of their contributions while minimizing personal risk. Additionally, if the average contribution is consistently low, it might be optimal to contribute more to potentially stimulate a higher total contribution from others. This dynamic approach will require continuous self-reflection and adjustment based on the evolving behavior of other players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes individual gain. There seems to be a lack of coordination with other players, as my contributions don't always align with the highest public pot values. This results in missed opportunities for higher payoffs when others contribute more tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute tokens based on the average contribution of the previous round, with a small adjustment for the current round's perceived behavior of other players. If the average contribution is high, I should contribute more to benefit from the larger public good. If it's low, I should contribute less to conserve tokens. Additionally, I should consider contributing slightly more than the average to potentially incentivize others to contribute more, thus increasing the public pot. This adaptive strategy should better align my actions with the potential for higher payoffs.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2's contribution strategy is inconsistent, ranging from 2 to 6 tokens per round. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good dynamics. The player seems to contribute more tokens when others contribute more, but doesn't consistently contribute to maximize personal gain when others contribute less.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of tokens based on the average contribution of the previous round. This would allow for a dynamic yet controlled response to other players' behavior, ensuring that Player 2 doesn't overcontribute when others freeride and doesn't undercontribute when the collective contribution is high. Additionally, setting a personal threshold for minimum and maximum contributions can help balance risk and reward, preventing extreme losses or gains.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing their tokens. There seems to be a lack of coordination with other players, as contributions vary round by round without a clear pattern. This inconsistency could lead to suboptimal payoffs when the public pot is lower due to lower collective contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic approach. A possible high-level plan is to estimate the average contribution of other players and contribute just enough to ensure the public pot multiplier (2) results in a higher payoff than retaining all tokens. Additionally, Player 2 should consider adjusting their contribution based on the current token balance, contributing more when they have a larger buffer and less when their token count is lower to minimize potential losses. This way, Player 2 can balance between contributing to the public good and preserving their own tokens for future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing their tokens. There are instances where Player 2 contributes more tokens to the public pot when the average contribution from other players is lower, leading to a less efficient use of their tokens. For example, in Round 16, Player 2 contributed 5 tokens when the average was 3, resulting in a lower gain compared to the contribution.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A high-level plan could be to contribute tokens in proportion to the average contribution of the other players, ensuring a more balanced distribution and potentially maximizing individual gains. If the average contribution is low, Player 2 should contribute less, and if the average is high, they should contribute more. This way, the public pot will be more efficiently utilized, and Player 2's token balance should improve over time. Additionally, considering the threshold where the marginal benefit of contributing an additional token equals the cost can help in making more informed decisions.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_2's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing their tokens. There are instances where player_2 contributes more tokens when the average contribution from other players is lower, leading to a lower public pot multiplier and a smaller individual gain. Conversely, when others contribute more, player_2 sometimes contributes less, missing out on potentially higher payoffs.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more adaptive strategy. A high-level plan could be to estimate the average contribution of the other players and aim to contribute slightly less than that amount to take advantage of the public good multiplier while avoiding over-contributing. Additionally, if the estimated average contribution is low, player_2 should consider contributing just enough to reach a threshold that would significantly increase the public pot's multiplier, as this could lead to a higher overall gain. This approach balances the risk of over-contributing with the potential for larger payoffs when the pot is more substantial.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot, which may be due to an inconsistent strategy or an attempt to conserve tokens for later rounds. This inconsistent contribution leads to fluctuating gains and can result in missed opportunities for higher payoffs when other players contribute more tokens. To mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing tokens when the average contribution from other players is high, to maximize the multiplication factor and ensure a fair share of the public good payoff. Additionally, Player 2 should consider contributing slightly more tokens when their own token count is above average to potentially drive up the total pot and create a stronger incentive for others to contribute as well.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_2's contribution strategy is not consistently aligned with maximizing their gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, especially when other players also contribute significantly. For example, in Round 21, contributing more tokens would have led to a higher multiplication factor and thus a larger share of the public good.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the contributions of other players. If the majority of players are contributing a high number of tokens, player_2 should also contribute more to take advantage of the higher multiplier. Conversely, if other players are contributing fewer tokens, player_2 should contribute less to conserve tokens. Additionally, player_2 should aim for a balance between cooperation and self-interest, as consistently contributing the minimum may lead to lower payoffs when others contribute more.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_2's contribution strategy is inconsistent, alternating between higher and lower contributions without a clear pattern. This inconsistency could lead to suboptimal gains, as the player might not be effectively leveraging the public good multiplier. To mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens or adjusting their contribution based on the average contribution of other players. This way, they can potentially maximize their gains by considering the collective behavior of the group and the potential impact on the public pot.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with varying degrees of consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes personal gain. There seems to be a lack of a clear strategy, as contributions don't consistently align with the amounts that would optimize the public good payoff relative to the other players' contributions. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing the amount that would result in the public pot multiplying to a total just below the average tokens I have, assuming other players also contribute optimally. This way, I can balance the risk of losing tokens with the potential for a higher payoff. Additionally, I should consider the tendencies of other players and adjust my strategy accordingly, contributing more when others tend to contribute less, and less when they contribute more, to exploit any free-riding behavior.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their long-term gain. There seems to be a lack of coordination with other players, as Player 2's contributions don't always align with the highest paying rounds. To mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing more tokens when others are also contributing significantly, to capitalize on the higher multipliers. Additionally, they should consider contributing less when others contribute very little, to avoid subsidizing others' gains without a proportional benefit. This way, Player 2 can balance their contributions to optimize their overall token accumulation.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_2's contribution strategy is inconsistent, alternating between contributing more tokens (4 or 5) and contributing fewer tokens (2 or 3). This inconsistency could be leading to suboptimal gains, as the player might not be fully capitalizing on the public good when others contribute more. To mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed amount based on the average contribution of other players or contributing just enough to ensure the public pot multiplier (2) results in a higher individual gain than the cost of the contribution. This way, player_2 can potentially maximize their long-term gains while adapting to the behavior of other players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes individual gain. There seems to be a lack of coordination and strategic adaptation to other players' contributions. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the average contribution of other players. If others are contributing more, I should contribute less to avoid free-ridership; if they contribute less, I should contribute more to potentially benefit from a higher multiplier. This way, I aim to balance my contributions with the potential payoff, ensuring a more optimal outcome in each round.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_2's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, and times when contributing less would have been more beneficial. The primary reason for this seems to be an inconsistent assessment of the optimal contribution level relative to the other players' contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more adaptive strategy. A potential high-level plan is to estimate the average contribution of other players and contribute just enough tokens to reach the threshold where the public good multiplier (2) starts to decline significantly due to the reduced marginal contribution of each additional token. This strategy, combined with monitoring the variability in other players' contributions, would allow player_2 to better balance personal gain with the group's total contribution, maximizing the overall benefit. Additionally, considering the potential for free-riding behavior in others, player_2 should be prepared to adjust contributions downward if others consistently contribute less.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_2's contribution strategy is inconsistent, alternating between higher and lower contributions without a clear pattern. This inconsistency could be leading to suboptimal gains, as the player is not fully capitalizing on rounds where contributing more tokens would result in a higher multiplier for the public good. To mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering factors such as the average contribution of other players and the potential payoff. A high-level plan could be to contribute slightly more than the average contribution of other players to benefit from the multiplied public good while ensuring a fair division, and adjusting this strategy based on the evolving behavior of other players. This way, player_2 can potentially maximize gains while minimizing the risk of exploitation.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes long-term gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot.

A new high-level plan would be to:\n\n1. Observe the average contribution of other players over the past few rounds.\n2. If the average contribution is high, contribute more tokens to capitalize on the larger potential public good.\n3. If the average contribution is low, consider contributing fewer tokens to conserve private tokens, as the public good payoff will likely be smaller.\n4. Continuously update this strategy based on the changing behavior of other players and the evolving dynamics of the game.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_2's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, ranging from 2 to 6 tokens across the provided rounds. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't seem to be based on a clear pattern or response to other players' contributions. To mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens or adjusting their contribution based on the average contribution of other players.

This inconsistent strategy might lead to missed opportunities for maximizing gains.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more strategic approach. A possible high-level plan is to contribute tokens to the public pot in a way that aligns with the average contribution of the other players, while also considering the potential gain from the public good multiplier. If the average contribution is high and the potential gain outweighs the cost, player_2 should contribute more tokens. Conversely, if the average contribution is low or the potential gain is marginal, player_2 should contribute less or not at all to preserve tokens. This way, player_2 can better balance risk and reward, and potentially increase overall token accumulation over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some inconsistency. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the multiplier effect, but I have chosen to contribute less in those rounds. This inconsistency could be a result of not fully optimizing the contribution strategy based on the contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to calculate the average contribution of the other players and aim to contribute slightly less than that amount, ensuring a balance between benefiting from the public good and not over-contributing. This strategy would prevent me from being exploited while still benefiting from the collective contribution. Additionally, I should be more aggressive in rounds where the total contribution is close to a higher multiplier threshold, as this would lead to a larger payoff.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some inconsistency.

A possible high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens, say 40%, to the public pot in each round. This way, I balance my contributions while ensuring that I am not overly generous or too conservative. Additionally, I should consider adjusting this percentage based on the average contribution of other players, aiming to contribute slightly less than the average to exploit any free-riding tendencies in the group. This strategy should lead to more consistent gains over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, player_2 seems to be contributing tokens to the public pot with some inconsistency.

This could involve tracking the average contribution of other players and adjusting player_2's contribution to be slightly below that average, to benefit from the public good while minimizing personal loss. Additionally, in rounds where the total contribution is likely to result in a low public good payoff, player_2 should consider contributing fewer tokens to preserve their private collection. This approach would balance risk and reward more effectively and potentially lead to a higher overall token count by the end of the game.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes individual gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. However, there are also times when contributing fewer tokens would have been beneficial, as other players' contributions were low, leading to a lower public good payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach that takes into account the contributions of other players. A potential high-level plan is to:\n\n1. Observe the average contribution of other players over the last few rounds.\n2. If the average contribution is high, contribute slightly less than the average to benefit from the public good without giving away too many tokens.\n3. If the average contribution is low, contribute slightly more than the average to potentially capitalize on a higher multiplier effect.\n4. Continuously update this strategy based on the changing behavior of other players to adapt to their evolving strategies.\n\nThis approach aims to balance risk and reward, ensuring that I am neither over-contributing when others are not, nor under-contributing when the collective effort is high.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some inconsistency. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the multiplier effect, but there are also times when contributing fewer tokens was beneficial because others did not contribute as much. This suggests a lack of effective strategy in predicting and adapting to the behavior of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose a new high-level plan that involves adopting a more cooperative strategy when others are also contributing significantly, and a more selfish strategy when others are contributing less. Specifically, I should aim to contribute close to the average contribution of the other players in each round to maximize the benefit from the public good. Additionally, I should consider adjusting my contributions slightly higher or lower based on the round's total tokens in the pot, to exploit potential opportunities for higher payoffs when the pot is larger. This adaptive approach should lead to more consistent gains over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, player_2 seems to be contributing tokens to the public pot inconsistently, with a tendency to contribute less when other players contribute more. This strategy might lead to lower gains in rounds where the total contribution is high, as player_2 is not fully benefiting from the multiplied public good payoff. To mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more cooperative strategy, contributing a consistent amount (e.g., the average contribution of the previous round) to align with the group's efforts and maximize the collective benefit.

A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens to the public pot in each round, taking into account the average contribution of other players.

Additionally, I should adjust this percentage dynamically as the game progresses, considering the changing behavior of other players and the potential for cooperation or free-riding.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some inconsistency. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the larger public pot, while in other cases, contributing fewer tokens would have been more beneficial. The primary reason for potential failure seems to be the lack of a clear strategy in adjusting contributions based on the actions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose a new high-level plan: adopt a conditional contribution strategy. This strategy involves observing the average contribution of the other players in the previous round and adjusting my contribution to match or slightly exceed that average. This way, I can contribute enough to benefit from the public good without over-contributing when others are not. Additionally, if the average contribution is low, it might be optimal to contribute just enough to ensure a minimum public pot is reached, to prevent free-riding by other players. This adaptive approach should lead to more consistent gains over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_2's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't seem to be based on a clear pattern or response to other players' contributions. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of tokens (e.g., 50%) to the public pot in each round. This would ensure a consistent strategy while still allowing for a fair share of the public good payoff, regardless of other players' actions. Additionally, monitoring the average contributions of other players and adjusting the fixed percentage accordingly could further optimize the strategy.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes personal gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. However, there are also rounds where contributing fewer tokens would have been beneficial, as the total contribution from other players was low.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. I propose the following high-level plan:\n\n1. Observe the average contribution of other players over the last few rounds to predict the total public pot.\n2. Calculate the expected payoff from contributing different amounts of tokens, considering the 2x multiplier and the number of players.\n3. If the expected payoff from contributing more tokens exceeds the potential loss, contribute more; otherwise, contribute less or not at all to preserve tokens.\n4. Adjust the strategy dynamically as the game progresses, taking into account changes in other players' behavior.\n\nThis plan should help optimize my token contributions and maximize my overall gain in the game.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't seem to be based on a clear pattern or response to other players' contributions. To mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens or conditionally contributing based on the average contribution of other players. This would help to optimize the balance between personal gain and contribution to the public good. For example, Player 2 could choose to contribute 3 tokens if the average contribution is below 4, and 4 tokens if the average is 4 or above, aiming to maximize the multiplier effect while minimizing personal loss.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, player_2 seems to be contributing tokens to the public pot with some level of inconsistency.

A potential high-level plan is to contribute tokens to the public pot in a way that aligns with the average contribution of the other players. By doing so, player_2 can benefit more from the multiplied public good when others also contribute significantly. Additionally, player_2 should consider the potential for free-riders, who contribute less while still benefiting from the public good, and adjust contributions accordingly to minimize exploitation. This strategy aims to achieve a balance between cooperation and self-interest, maximizing long-term gains.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains.

This inconsistency could be a result of not having a clear optimal strategy or attempting to adapt to the contributions of other players. To mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more consistent strategy that balances personal gain with contributing to the public good. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed number of tokens, such as the average contribution seen in previous rounds, which would balance risk and reward while minimizing the impact of unpredictable fluctuations in contribution amounts. This approach would likely lead to more predictable outcomes and potentially better overall performance.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens in different rounds. This inconsistency might be causing Player 2 to miss out on potential gains when the public pot is larger due to higher contributions from other players. To mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic and stable contribution pattern, such as always contributing a fixed number of tokens (e.g., the average contribution of other players or a number that maximizes the expected return based on the average contributions in previous rounds). This would help ensure a more consistent gain and better exploit the public good dynamics.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes personal gain.

For instance, if the average contribution is 3 tokens, player_2 could contribute 4 tokens to slightly exceed the average and potentially gain a larger share without over-contributing. Additionally, player_2 should consider contributing more when others contribute significantly more, to take advantage of the larger pot. This way, a balance between cooperation and self-interest can be maintained, leading to potentially better long-term outcomes.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_2's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a result of not effectively anticipating the behavior of other players or not optimizing for long-term gain. To mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing tokens to maximize the public good when others are also contributing significantly, and conserving tokens when others contribute less. This way, player_2 can balance personal gain with the potential for a higher collective payout, ensuring a more stable token balance over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that optimizes their gains. There seems to be no clear pattern in their contribution decisions, which results in fluctuating token counts and missed opportunities for higher payoffs when other players contribute more. To mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing tokens when they anticipate that others will also contribute significantly, thus maximizing the multiplication factor. This can be done by observing the average contributions of other players and adjusting their own contribution accordingly to benefit from the larger public good. Additionally, Player 2 should consider contributing less when others contribute very little, to prevent free-riding by other players and preserve their own tokens.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_2 is contributing tokens to the public pot with a varying strategy, but not consistently contributing the maximum amount when it would lead to a higher personal gain. In rounds where player_2 contributes more tokens, the gain is often higher, but in rounds with lower contributions, the gain is lower or equal. This inconsistent strategy might lead to missed opportunities for maximizing personal tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more strategic approach based on the contributions of other players. If the majority of other players are contributing more tokens, player_2 should consider contributing the maximum to take advantage of the larger public pot. Conversely, if other players are contributing fewer tokens, player_2 should adjust downward to conserve tokens, as the smaller public pot would result in a lower individual gain. This adaptive strategy should help player_2 optimize token accumulation over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_2 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot, sometimes choosing to contribute less than other players. This inconsistency could be due to a lack of a clear strategy or an attempt to exploit the contributions of others. To mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more consistent strategy, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens in each round, or mirroring the average contribution of the other players. This way, player_2 can better predict their potential gains and potentially exploit any cooperative behavior in the group.\n\n```"

      "learnings": "Reflections:\n-Upon reviewing the historical data from Round 1, a possible reason for failure or suboptimal performance is that some players, including myself as player_2, contributed more tokens than others without receiving a proportionally higher benefit. In this case, I contributed 6 tokens, which is above the average contribution, but the public good payoff was evenly divided among all players, resulting in a similar gain for everyone. This situation can lead to free-riding, where players might contribute less in future rounds to maximize their individual tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan is to adopt a more strategic and selfish approach in the short term. I should aim to contribute just enough tokens to ensure the public pot is not empty, as a minimum contribution is still beneficial due to the 2x multiplier. However, I should also monitor the contributions of other players and adjust my contribution to be slightly below the average, to avoid over-contributing while still benefiting from the public good. This strategy will help balance my individual gain with the collective effort, reducing the risk of being a disproportionate contributor.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data provided, it appears that the players are contributing varying amounts of tokens to the public pot. In Round 1, the average contribution was high (5.6 tokens), while in Round 2, it was lower (5 tokens). The discrepancy in player contributions might lead to inconsistent payoffs and potentially less optimal outcomes for all players. To mitigate this issue, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more consistent contribution strategy, such as contributing a fixed percentage of one's tokens in each round. This would ensure a more predictable payoff and reduce the impact of other players' variable contributions. Additionally, monitoring the average contribution of other players and adjusting one's strategy accordingly could also be beneficial to optimize gains while minimizing risks.\nReflections:\n-Upon reviewing the historical data from the first three rounds, a pattern emerges where the players, including myself as player_2, are contributing varying amounts of tokens to the public pot. In Round 1, the contributions were relatively high, while in Round 2 and Round 3, they decreased. This inconsistency could be due to each player trying to optimize their individual gains by adjusting their contributions based on others' actions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my strategy, I should adopt a more consistent approach that balances my contributions with the potential benefits. A possible high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens, say 20%, to the public pot in each round. This way, I can maintain a stable strategy while minimizing the risk of exploitation by other players who might notice and exploit my changing contribution patterns. Additionally, this approach encourages cooperation by consistently investing in the public good without being overly sensitive to short-term fluctuations in others' contributions.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) is contributing less tokens to the public pot compared to some other players, particularly in Round 2 and Round 4. This conservative strategy might be resulting in lower potential gains when other players contribute more. The discrepancy could be due to an attempt to conserve tokens for future rounds or a misjudgment of the optimal contribution level.\n\nTo mitigate this potential failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A new high-level plan would be to calculate the average contribution of all players in the previous round and contribute slightly above that average to encourage others to contribute more while still benefiting from the public good. This way, I can balance between personal gain and contributing to the group's success. Additionally, I should consider adjusting my contribution based on the current token balance to ensure long-term sustainability.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2 is contributing tokens to the public pot with varying levels of consistency. In Round 1, they contributed 6 tokens, then 5 tokens in Round 2, 4 tokens in Round 3, 3 tokens in Round 4, and 6 tokens again in Round 5. This inconsistent contribution strategy might be causing Player 2 to miss out on potential higher payoffs when other players contribute more tokens. \n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic and stable contribution pattern. A possible high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of their tokens, say 20%, to the public pot in each round. This way, they can maintain a consistent strategy while adapting to their growing token count. Additionally, they should also consider the contributions of other players, especially when they contribute more tokens, as it might be beneficial to contribute slightly more to take advantage of the higher multiplier on the public pot.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) is contributing tokens to the public pot with some inconsistency. In Round 1, I contributed 6 tokens, then in Round 2 and 3, I contributed 5 and 4 tokens, respectively, and in Rounds 4 and 6, I contributed only 3 tokens. This inconsistent contribution strategy might be causing me to miss out on potential higher payoffs when other players contribute more tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. A high-level plan would be to monitor the average contribution of other players and adjust my contribution to be slightly below that average. This way, I can benefit from the public good while minimizing the risk of over-contributing when others contribute less. Additionally, I should consider contributing more when the total tokens in the pot have the potential to result in a higher than average payoff per token contributed, given the 2x multiplier. This balanced and responsive strategy should lead to more consistent gains over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) is contributing tokens to the public pot with some inconsistency. In Round 1, I contributed 6 tokens, then in Round 2 and 3, I contributed 5 and 4 tokens, respectively, and in Rounds 4 and 7, I contributed only 3 tokens. This inconsistent contribution pattern might be causing me to miss out on potential gains when other players contribute more tokens to the pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic and consistent approach to token contribution. A possible high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my total tokens to the public pot in each round, taking into account the average contribution of other players. This way, I can balance the risk of losing tokens and the potential for a higher payoff from the public good. Additionally, I should consider adjusting this percentage dynamically based on the observed behavior of other players, contributing slightly more when others contribute more and less when they contribute less, to optimize my overall gain.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes individual gain. There seems to be a lack of coordination with other players, as my contributions don't always align with the highest paying off actions. In some rounds, I contribute more tokens when others contribute less, leading to a lower individual gain due to the public good being multiplied by a lower total.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute tokens in a way that balances personal gain with the potential for a higher public good. This can be achieved by observing the average contribution of other players and contributing slightly more than that average to potentially benefit from a larger multiplier without over-contributing. Additionally, I should consider the potential for free-riders, who contribute less while benefiting from others' contributions, and adjust my strategy accordingly to avoid being exploited.\nReflections:\n-Upon reviewing the historical data, a pattern emerges in player_2's contributions. In rounds where player_2 contributes more tokens to the public pot, the individual gain is not consistently higher than when contributing fewer tokens. This could be due to the variability in other players' contributions, which affects the total pot and the resulting payoff. To mitigate this issue, a new high-level plan is to adopt a more strategic approach: contribute tokens to the public pot when the expected gain is higher than the cost of contribution, which can be estimated by observing the average contributions of other players. If others tend to contribute more, it's beneficial to contribute more as well; if they contribute less, it's better to conserve tokens. This way, player_2 can balance risk and reward more effectively.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) is contributing tokens to the public pot with some inconsistency. There seems to be no clear strategy in terms of how many tokens are contributed, as the contributions range from 3 to 9 tokens across the first 10 rounds. This inconsistent contribution pattern could lead to suboptimal gains, as I am not effectively leveraging the 2x multiplier for the public good.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose adopting a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my current tokens to the public pot in each round. For example, I could contribute 20% of my tokens, which would allow me to balance participation in the public good while retaining enough tokens for future rounds. This consistent strategy should lead to more predictable gains and better overall performance in the game. Additionally, I should also consider adjusting this percentage based on the contributions of other players, if that information is available, to maximize the benefit from the public good.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for failure or suboptimal performance is that Player 2 is not consistently contributing the optimal number of tokens to maximize their gains. There seems to be no clear pattern in their contributions, which results in fluctuating gains. In some rounds, they contribute more tokens when it might not be beneficial (e.g., Round 1 with 6 tokens), while in other rounds, they contribute less when contributing more could lead to a higher payoff (e.g., Round 4 with 3 tokens when others contributed more).\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic approach. A high-level plan could be to contribute tokens based on the average contribution of the other players. If the average contribution is high, Player 2 should contribute close to that average to benefit from the larger public good. If the average is low, contributing less might be more beneficial to avoid losing tokens without a significant public good payoff. Additionally, Player 2 should consider the potential for free-ridership, where others might contribute less while still benefiting from the public good, and adjust their strategy accordingly to not overcontribute.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that optimizes their long-term gain. There seems to be a lack of strategic coordination with other players, as contributions are not aligned with the patterns of other players, leading to variable payoffs. To mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing tokens when the expected public good payoff is higher (when others are likely to contribute more) or using a tit-for-tat strategy, where they match the average contribution of the previous round. This should help to stabilize payoffs and potentially increase overall tokens collected.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) is contributing tokens to the public pot with some level of inconsistency. There seems to be no clear strategy in terms of how many tokens are contributed, as the contributions range from 3 to 9 tokens across the rounds. This inconsistent contribution pattern could lead to suboptimal gains, as I am not effectively leveraging the 2x multiplier for the public good payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose adopting a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens to the public pot in each round, such as 40%, which would balance risk and reward while maintaining consistency. This way, I can better predict my potential gains and minimize the impact of other players' contributions on my strategy. Additionally, I should monitor the average contribution of other players and adjust my percentage slightly if their behavior suggests a more cooperative or selfish approach.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that optimizes their long-term gain. There seems to be a lack of strategic coordination with other players, as contributions are not aligned with the patterns of other players. This leads to fluctuating gains and occasionally lower returns when contributing more tokens while others contribute less.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the contributions of other players. A potential high-level plan is to contribute tokens equal to the average contribution of the other players in the previous round, with adjustments based on the total tokens in the pot. This strategy aims to balance personal gain with the group's collective effort, ensuring a more stable increase in tokens over time. Additionally, if the average contribution decreases significantly, it might be beneficial to contribute less to avoid exploitation by free-riding players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes individual gain. There seems to be a lack of coordination with other players, as contributions are not always aligned with the optimal strategy for a given round. In some rounds, contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose a new high-level plan: adopt a more strategic and adaptive contribution strategy. This would involve observing the average contribution of other players in previous rounds and adjusting my contribution to be slightly below that average, to take advantage of their contributions while minimizing personal risk. Additionally, if the average contribution is consistently low, it might be optimal to contribute more to potentially stimulate a higher total contribution from others. This dynamic approach will require continuous self-reflection and adjustment based on the evolving behavior of other players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes individual gain. There seems to be a lack of coordination with other players, as my contributions don't always align with the highest public pot values. This results in missed opportunities for higher payoffs when others contribute more tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute tokens based on the average contribution of the previous round, with a small adjustment for the current round's perceived behavior of other players. If the average contribution is high, I should contribute more to benefit from the larger public good. If it's low, I should contribute less to conserve tokens. Additionally, I should consider contributing slightly more than the average to potentially incentivize others to contribute more, thus increasing the public pot. This adaptive strategy should better align my actions with the potential for higher payoffs.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2's contribution strategy is inconsistent, ranging from 2 to 6 tokens per round. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good dynamics. The player seems to contribute more tokens when others contribute more, but doesn't consistently contribute to maximize personal gain when others contribute less.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of tokens based on the average contribution of the previous round. This would allow for a dynamic yet controlled response to other players' behavior, ensuring that Player 2 doesn't overcontribute when others freeride and doesn't undercontribute when the collective contribution is high. Additionally, setting a personal threshold for minimum and maximum contributions can help balance risk and reward, preventing extreme losses or gains.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing their tokens. There seems to be a lack of coordination with other players, as contributions vary round by round without a clear pattern. This inconsistency could lead to suboptimal payoffs when the public pot is lower due to lower collective contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic approach. A possible high-level plan is to estimate the average contribution of other players and contribute just enough to ensure the public pot multiplier (2) results in a higher payoff than retaining all tokens. Additionally, Player 2 should consider adjusting their contribution based on the current token balance, contributing more when they have a larger buffer and less when their token count is lower to minimize potential losses. This way, Player 2 can balance between contributing to the public good and preserving their own tokens for future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing their tokens. There are instances where Player 2 contributes more tokens to the public pot when the average contribution from other players is lower, leading to a less efficient use of their tokens. For example, in Round 16, Player 2 contributed 5 tokens when the average was 3, resulting in a lower gain compared to the contribution.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A high-level plan could be to contribute tokens in proportion to the average contribution of the other players, ensuring a more balanced distribution and potentially maximizing individual gains. If the average contribution is low, Player 2 should contribute less, and if the average is high, they should contribute more. This way, the public pot will be more efficiently utilized, and Player 2's token balance should improve over time. Additionally, considering the threshold where the marginal benefit of contributing an additional token equals the cost can help in making more informed decisions.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_2's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing their tokens. There are instances where player_2 contributes more tokens when the average contribution from other players is lower, leading to a lower public pot multiplier and a smaller individual gain. Conversely, when others contribute more, player_2 sometimes contributes less, missing out on potentially higher payoffs.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more adaptive strategy. A high-level plan could be to estimate the average contribution of the other players and aim to contribute slightly less than that amount to take advantage of the public good multiplier while avoiding over-contributing. Additionally, if the estimated average contribution is low, player_2 should consider contributing just enough to reach a threshold that would significantly increase the public pot's multiplier, as this could lead to a higher overall gain. This approach balances the risk of over-contributing with the potential for larger payoffs when the pot is more substantial.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot, which may be due to an inconsistent strategy or an attempt to conserve tokens for later rounds. This inconsistent contribution leads to fluctuating gains and can result in missed opportunities for higher payoffs when other players contribute more tokens. To mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing tokens when the average contribution from other players is high, to maximize the multiplication factor and ensure a fair share of the public good payoff. Additionally, Player 2 should consider contributing slightly more tokens when their own token count is above average to potentially drive up the total pot and create a stronger incentive for others to contribute as well.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_2's contribution strategy is not consistently aligned with maximizing their gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, especially when other players also contribute significantly. For example, in Round 21, contributing more tokens would have led to a higher multiplication factor and thus a larger share of the public good.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the contributions of other players. If the majority of players are contributing a high number of tokens, player_2 should also contribute more to take advantage of the higher multiplier. Conversely, if other players are contributing fewer tokens, player_2 should contribute less to conserve tokens. Additionally, player_2 should aim for a balance between cooperation and self-interest, as consistently contributing the minimum may lead to lower payoffs when others contribute more.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_2's contribution strategy is inconsistent, alternating between higher and lower contributions without a clear pattern. This inconsistency could lead to suboptimal gains, as the player might not be effectively leveraging the public good multiplier. To mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens or adjusting their contribution based on the average contribution of other players. This way, they can potentially maximize their gains by considering the collective behavior of the group and the potential impact on the public pot.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with varying degrees of consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes personal gain. There seems to be a lack of a clear strategy, as contributions don't consistently align with the amounts that would optimize the public good payoff relative to the other players' contributions. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing the amount that would result in the public pot multiplying to a total just below the average tokens I have, assuming other players also contribute optimally. This way, I can balance the risk of losing tokens with the potential for a higher payoff. Additionally, I should consider the tendencies of other players and adjust my strategy accordingly, contributing more when others tend to contribute less, and less when they contribute more, to exploit any free-riding behavior.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their long-term gain. There seems to be a lack of coordination with other players, as Player 2's contributions don't always align with the highest paying rounds. To mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing more tokens when others are also contributing significantly, to capitalize on the higher multipliers. Additionally, they should consider contributing less when others contribute very little, to avoid subsidizing others' gains without a proportional benefit. This way, Player 2 can balance their contributions to optimize their overall token accumulation.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_2's contribution strategy is inconsistent, alternating between contributing more tokens (4 or 5) and contributing fewer tokens (2 or 3). This inconsistency could be leading to suboptimal gains, as the player might not be fully capitalizing on the public good when others contribute more. To mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed amount based on the average contribution of other players or contributing just enough to ensure the public pot multiplier (2) results in a higher individual gain than the cost of the contribution. This way, player_2 can potentially maximize their long-term gains while adapting to the behavior of other players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes individual gain. There seems to be a lack of coordination and strategic adaptation to other players' contributions. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the average contribution of other players. If others are contributing more, I should contribute less to avoid free-ridership; if they contribute less, I should contribute more to potentially benefit from a higher multiplier. This way, I aim to balance my contributions with the potential payoff, ensuring a more optimal outcome in each round.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_2's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, and times when contributing less would have been more beneficial. The primary reason for this seems to be an inconsistent assessment of the optimal contribution level relative to the other players' contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more adaptive strategy. A potential high-level plan is to estimate the average contribution of other players and contribute just enough tokens to reach the threshold where the public good multiplier (2) starts to decline significantly due to the reduced marginal contribution of each additional token. This strategy, combined with monitoring the variability in other players' contributions, would allow player_2 to better balance personal gain with the group's total contribution, maximizing the overall benefit. Additionally, considering the potential for free-riding behavior in others, player_2 should be prepared to adjust contributions downward if others consistently contribute less.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_2's contribution strategy is inconsistent, alternating between higher and lower contributions without a clear pattern. This inconsistency could be leading to suboptimal gains, as the player is not fully capitalizing on rounds where contributing more tokens would result in a higher multiplier for the public good. To mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering factors such as the average contribution of other players and the potential payoff. A high-level plan could be to contribute slightly more than the average contribution of other players to benefit from the multiplied public good while ensuring a fair division, and adjusting this strategy based on the evolving behavior of other players. This way, player_2 can potentially maximize gains while minimizing the risk of exploitation.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes long-term gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. For example, in Round 21, contributing 10 tokens would have led to a significantly higher payoff compared to contributing 4 tokens. \n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach that takes into account the contributions of other players and the potential for a higher payoff when the public pot is larger. A new high-level plan would be to:\n\n1. Observe the average contribution of other players over the past few rounds.\n2. If the average contribution is high, contribute more tokens to capitalize on the larger potential public good.\n3. If the average contribution is low, consider contributing fewer tokens to conserve private tokens, as the public good payoff will likely be smaller.\n4. Continuously update this strategy based on the changing behavior of other players and the evolving dynamics of the game.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_2's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, ranging from 2 to 6 tokens across the provided rounds. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't seem to be based on a clear pattern or response to other players' contributions. To mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens or adjusting their contribution based on the average contribution of other players. This way, they can potentially maximize their gains while considering the behavior of the group.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, player_2 seems to be contributing tokens to the public pot with some inconsistency. There are instances where player_2 contributes more tokens when others contribute more, but there are also rounds where player_2 contributes less, even when the potential gain is higher. This inconsistent strategy might lead to missed opportunities for maximizing gains.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more strategic approach. A possible high-level plan is to contribute tokens to the public pot in a way that aligns with the average contribution of the other players, while also considering the potential gain from the public good multiplier. If the average contribution is high and the potential gain outweighs the cost, player_2 should contribute more tokens. Conversely, if the average contribution is low or the potential gain is marginal, player_2 should contribute less or not at all to preserve tokens. This way, player_2 can better balance risk and reward, and potentially increase overall token accumulation over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some inconsistency. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the multiplier effect, but I have chosen to contribute less in those rounds. This inconsistency could be a result of not fully optimizing the contribution strategy based on the contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to calculate the average contribution of the other players and aim to contribute slightly less than that amount, ensuring a balance between benefiting from the public good and not over-contributing. This strategy would prevent me from being exploited while still benefiting from the collective contribution. Additionally, I should be more aggressive in rounds where the total contribution is close to a higher multiplier threshold, as this would lead to a larger payoff.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some inconsistency. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the higher multiplication factor, but I have chosen to contribute less in those rounds. This inconsistent strategy might be causing me to miss out on potential gains.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. A possible high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens, say 40%, to the public pot in each round. This way, I balance my contributions while ensuring that I am not overly generous or too conservative. Additionally, I should consider adjusting this percentage based on the average contribution of other players, aiming to contribute slightly less than the average to exploit any free-riding tendencies in the group. This strategy should lead to more consistent gains over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, player_2 seems to be contributing tokens to the public pot with some inconsistency. There are instances where player_2 contributes more tokens when other players contribute more, but there are also rounds where player_2 contributes less, potentially missing out on higher payoffs. A possible reason for this could be a lack of strategic adaptation to the contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic and dynamic contribution strategy. This could involve tracking the average contribution of other players and adjusting player_2's contribution to be slightly below that average, to benefit from the public good while minimizing personal loss. Additionally, in rounds where the total contribution is likely to result in a low public good payoff, player_2 should consider contributing fewer tokens to preserve their private collection. This approach would balance risk and reward more effectively and potentially lead to a higher overall token count by the end of the game.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes individual gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. However, there are also times when contributing fewer tokens would have been beneficial, as other players' contributions were low, leading to a lower public good payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach that takes into account the contributions of other players. A potential high-level plan is to:\n\n1. Observe the average contribution of other players over the last few rounds.\n2. If the average contribution is high, contribute slightly less than the average to benefit from the public good without giving away too many tokens.\n3. If the average contribution is low, contribute slightly more than the average to potentially capitalize on a higher multiplier effect.\n4. Continuously update this strategy based on the changing behavior of other players to adapt to their evolving strategies.\n\nThis approach aims to balance risk and reward, ensuring that I am neither over-contributing when others are not, nor under-contributing when the collective effort is high.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some inconsistency. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the multiplier effect, but there are also times when contributing fewer tokens was beneficial because others did not contribute as much. This suggests a lack of effective strategy in predicting and adapting to the behavior of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose a new high-level plan that involves adopting a more cooperative strategy when others are also contributing significantly, and a more selfish strategy when others are contributing less. Specifically, I should aim to contribute close to the average contribution of the other players in each round to maximize the benefit from the public good. Additionally, I should consider adjusting my contributions slightly higher or lower based on the round's total tokens in the pot, to exploit potential opportunities for higher payoffs when the pot is larger. This adaptive approach should lead to more consistent gains over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, player_2 seems to be contributing tokens to the public pot inconsistently, with a tendency to contribute less when other players contribute more. This strategy might lead to lower gains in rounds where the total contribution is high, as player_2 is not fully benefiting from the multiplied public good payoff. To mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more cooperative strategy, contributing a consistent amount (e.g., the average contribution of the previous round) to align with the group's efforts and maximize the collective benefit. This way, player_2 can ensure a more stable gain over time and potentially benefit from the higher payoffs when the pot is larger.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) is contributing tokens to the public pot with some inconsistency. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the multiplier effect, but I have chosen to contribute less in those rounds. This inconsistent strategy might be causing me to miss out on potential gains when the total contribution is higher.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens to the public pot in each round, taking into account the average contribution of other players. This way, I can ensure that I am more consistently benefiting from the public good, especially when others contribute more. Additionally, I should adjust this percentage dynamically as the game progresses, considering the changing behavior of other players and the potential for cooperation or free-riding.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some inconsistency. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the larger public pot, while in other cases, contributing fewer tokens would have been more beneficial. The primary reason for potential failure seems to be the lack of a clear strategy in adjusting contributions based on the actions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose a new high-level plan: adopt a conditional contribution strategy. This strategy involves observing the average contribution of the other players in the previous round and adjusting my contribution to match or slightly exceed that average. This way, I can contribute enough to benefit from the public good without over-contributing when others are not. Additionally, if the average contribution is low, it might be optimal to contribute just enough to ensure a minimum public pot is reached, to prevent free-riding by other players. This adaptive approach should lead to more consistent gains over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_2's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't seem to be based on a clear pattern or response to other players' contributions. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of tokens (e.g., 50%) to the public pot in each round. This would ensure a consistent strategy while still allowing for a fair share of the public good payoff, regardless of other players' actions. Additionally, monitoring the average contributions of other players and adjusting the fixed percentage accordingly could further optimize the strategy.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes personal gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. However, there are also rounds where contributing fewer tokens would have been beneficial, as the total contribution from other players was low.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. I propose the following high-level plan:\n\n1. Observe the average contribution of other players over the last few rounds to predict the total public pot.\n2. Calculate the expected payoff from contributing different amounts of tokens, considering the 2x multiplier and the number of players.\n3. If the expected payoff from contributing more tokens exceeds the potential loss, contribute more; otherwise, contribute less or not at all to preserve tokens.\n4. Adjust the strategy dynamically as the game progresses, taking into account changes in other players' behavior.\n\nThis plan should help optimize my token contributions and maximize my overall gain in the game.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't seem to be based on a clear pattern or response to other players' contributions. To mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens or conditionally contributing based on the average contribution of other players. This would help to optimize the balance between personal gain and contribution to the public good. For example, Player 2 could choose to contribute 3 tokens if the average contribution is below 4, and 4 tokens if the average is 4 or above, aiming to maximize the multiplier effect while minimizing personal loss.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, player_2 seems to be contributing tokens to the public pot with some level of inconsistency. There are instances where player_2 contributes more tokens when the other players also contribute more, but sometimes they contribute less, even when others are contributing more. This inconsistent behavior could lead to missed opportunities for higher payoffs when the public pot is larger.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute tokens to the public pot in a way that aligns with the average contribution of the other players. By doing so, player_2 can benefit more from the multiplied public good when others also contribute significantly. Additionally, player_2 should consider the potential for free-riders, who contribute less while still benefiting from the public good, and adjust contributions accordingly to minimize exploitation. This strategy aims to achieve a balance between cooperation and self-interest, maximizing long-term gains.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, especially when other players contribute more tokens. To mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A new plan could be to contribute tokens equal to the average contribution of the other players, ensuring a fairer share of the public good while avoiding over-contributing when others do not. This way, Player 2 can balance personal gain with cooperation, potentially increasing overall token count over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't seem to effectively exploit the public good dynamics. In some rounds, Player 2 contributes more tokens than others, but does not always benefit proportionally due to the varying contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic and stable contribution pattern. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed number of tokens, such as the average contribution of the previous few rounds, or a number that ensures a minimum expected gain while taking into account the potential total contribution from other players. This way, Player 2 can balance the risk of over-contributing and under-contributing, leading to more consistent and potentially higher payoffs over time. Additionally, monitoring the contributions of other players and adjusting one's own contribution based on their behavior could also be beneficial.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_2's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a result of not having a clear optimal strategy or attempting to adapt to the contributions of other players. To mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more consistent strategy that balances personal gain with contributing to the public good. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed number of tokens, such as the average contribution seen in previous rounds, which would balance risk and reward while minimizing the impact of unpredictable fluctuations in contribution amounts. This approach would likely lead to more predictable outcomes and potentially better overall performance.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens in different rounds. This inconsistency might be causing Player 2 to miss out on potential gains when the public pot is larger due to higher contributions from other players. To mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic and stable contribution pattern, such as always contributing a fixed number of tokens (e.g., the average contribution of other players or a number that maximizes the expected return based on the average contributions in previous rounds). This would help ensure a more consistent gain and better exploit the public good dynamics.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes personal gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the larger public pot, and times when contributing fewer tokens would have been more beneficial because the pot was smaller or other players contributed less. The strategy seems to lack adaptability to the actions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose a new high-level plan: adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. If the average contribution of other players is high, I should contribute more to capitalize on the larger public good. Conversely, if other players are contributing less, I should contribute less to conserve tokens. Additionally, I should consider the potential for free-ridership when the majority of other players contribute, and adjust my contribution accordingly to balance personal gain and cooperation. This adaptive approach should lead to more optimal token management and increased overall payoff.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_2's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, ranging from 2 to 5 tokens per round. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good dynamics. The player seems to contribute more tokens when others contribute more, but doesn't consistently free-ride on lower contributions from others. To improve, player_2 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing just enough tokens to ensure a positive return, while avoiding over-contributing when others contribute less. This could involve tracking the average contributions of other players and adjusting contributions accordingly to maximize personal gain.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, especially when other players contribute more tokens. For example, in Round 21, contributing 10 tokens would have led to a higher gain for Player 2, given the high total tokens in the pot. \n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A high-level plan could be to contribute a percentage of tokens equal to the average contribution of the other players, ensuring a balanced participation in the public good while minimizing the risk of being a free-rider. Additionally, when the total tokens in the pot are likely to result in a high multiplier (e.g., when others contribute significantly), Player 2 should be more willing to contribute more tokens to capitalize on the larger potential gain.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't seem to exploit the most beneficial contribution level given the other players' behavior. To mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing the same number of tokens as the average contribution of the other players in the previous round, or contributing just enough to ensure a slightly higher public pot multiplier (e.g., contribute 4 tokens if the sum of other contributions is 15 or less, to guarantee a 2x multiplier). This way, Player 2 can potentially maximize gains while minimizing personal losses.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_2's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, especially when other players contribute more tokens. To mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the average contribution of other players. If the average contribution is high, player_2 should contribute more to take advantage of the larger multiplier. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, contributing fewer tokens might be more beneficial to retain private tokens. This way, player_2 can adapt to the behavior of other players and potentially increase their overall gain.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 2's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute more tokens. To mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the average contribution of other players in each round and adjusting their own contribution to maximize the benefit from the 2x multiplier. If others are contributing significantly, Player 2 should also contribute more to take advantage of the larger public good. If others contribute little, Player 2 should conserve tokens to avoid subsidizing others without a proportional return. This dynamic adjustment strategy should lead to better long-term gains.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_2's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't seem to effectively exploit the public good dynamics. In some rounds, player_2 contributes more tokens when others contribute less, leading to a lower individual gain due to the lower total pot. \n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_2 could be to adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. This could involve monitoring the average contribution of other players and contributing just enough to ensure a slightly higher than average share of the public good payoff, while still retaining a reasonable number of tokens for future rounds. For instance, if the average contribution is 3 tokens, player_2 could contribute 4 tokens to slightly exceed the average and potentially gain a larger share without over-contributing. Additionally, player_2 should consider contributing more when others contribute significantly more, to take advantage of the larger pot. This way, a balance between cooperation and self-interest can be maintained, leading to potentially better long-term outcomes.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_2's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a result of not effectively anticipating the behavior of other players or not optimizing for long-term gain. To mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing tokens to maximize the public good when others are also contributing significantly, and conserving tokens when others contribute less. This way, player_2 can balance personal gain with the potential for a higher collective payout, ensuring a more stable token balance over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 2 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that optimizes their gains. There seems to be no clear pattern in their contribution decisions, which results in fluctuating token counts and missed opportunities for higher payoffs when other players contribute more. To mitigate this failure, Player 2 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing tokens when they anticipate that others will also contribute significantly, thus maximizing the multiplication factor. This can be done by observing the average contributions of other players and adjusting their own contribution accordingly to benefit from the larger public good. Additionally, Player 2 should consider contributing less when others contribute very little, to prevent free-riding by other players and preserve their own tokens.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_2 is contributing tokens to the public pot with a varying strategy, but not consistently contributing the maximum amount when it would lead to a higher personal gain. In rounds where player_2 contributes more tokens, the gain is often higher, but in rounds with lower contributions, the gain is lower or equal. This inconsistent strategy might lead to missed opportunities for maximizing personal tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more strategic approach based on the contributions of other players. If the majority of other players are contributing more tokens, player_2 should consider contributing the maximum to take advantage of the larger public pot. Conversely, if other players are contributing fewer tokens, player_2 should adjust downward to conserve tokens, as the smaller public pot would result in a lower individual gain. This adaptive strategy should help player_2 optimize token accumulation over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_2 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot, sometimes choosing to contribute less than other players. This inconsistency could be due to a lack of a clear strategy or an attempt to exploit the contributions of others. To mitigate this failure, player_2 should adopt a more consistent strategy, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens in each round, or mirroring the average contribution of the other players. This way, player_2 can better predict their potential gains and potentially exploit any cooperative behavior in the group.\n",

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-Upon reviewing the historical data from Round 1, a possible reason for failure or suboptimal performance is that some players contributed more tokens than others, leading to an unequal distribution of the \"public good\" payoff. In this case, player_3 (myself) contributed 5 tokens, which was less than the average contribution. This might have resulted in a lower gain compared to players who contributed more.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan is to adopt a strategy that considers the average contribution of the group in each round. By aiming to contribute slightly above the average, I can potentially benefit from the higher multiplier while still receiving a fair share of the public good payoff. This strategy assumes that other players will also act rationally, seeking to optimize their gains. However, it's crucial to continuously adapt this strategy based on the evolving behavior of other players to ensure its effectiveness over multiple rounds.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the players are contributing varying amounts of tokens to the public pot. In Round 1, the average contribution was high, with a total of 29 tokens, while in Round 2, the average was lower at 27 tokens. You, as player_3, contributed 5 tokens in Round 1 and 6 tokens in Round 2, which was close to the average contribution in both rounds. However, your gains were lower than the average gain in both rounds, suggesting that contributing the same amount as others might not be the most optimal strategy.\n\nA possible reason for this outcome is that other players might be adjusting their contributions strategically, either by free-riding (contributing less) or by attempting to manipulate the public good by contributing more when they expect others to contribute less. This behavior can lead to inconsistent payoffs for you.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more dynamic and adaptive strategy. This could involve monitoring the average contribution of other players and adjusting your contribution to be slightly below the average. By doing so, you can potentially benefit from the public good while minimizing the risk of over-contributing when others are not. Additionally, consider the possibility of occasionally deviating from this strategy to exploit potential free-riders, contributing more when others contribute less, to encourage a more balanced contribution from the group.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the players, including myself as player_3, are contributing varying amounts of tokens to the public pot. In Round 1, the average contribution was high, leading to a larger public good payoff, but in Round 2 and Round 3, the average contribution decreased, resulting in lower payoffs. The inconsistency in player contributions suggests a lack of coordination or strategy among the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose a new high-level plan: adopt a consistent contribution strategy. A potential strategy could be to contribute a fixed percentage of my total tokens to the public pot in each round, say 20%, to balance between supporting the public good and retaining tokens for personal gain. This way, I can maintain a stable approach regardless of other players' actions, and potentially encourage others to adopt a similar strategy if they observe the stability and potential benefits. Additionally, I should monitor the average contribution of other players and adjust my strategy if it appears that a higher or lower contribution level would be more beneficial.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_3 (myself) is contributing tokens consistently without much variation in the number of tokens contributed (5, 6, 4, 5). This lack of adaptability might be causing me to miss out on potential higher payoffs when other players contribute more tokens, as my fixed contribution doesn't maximize the benefit from the public good multiplier. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A high-level plan would be to contribute a percentage of my tokens that is proportional to the average contribution of all players in the previous round, ensuring that I am more aligned with the group's behavior and can potentially benefit more from the public good. This way, when others contribute more, I contribute more, and vice versa, optimizing my overall gain over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 3 (myself) has been contributing a consistent amount of tokens to the public pot, with contributions ranging from 4 to 6 tokens. However, the total tokens contributed by all players in each round vary, and there seems to be no clear pattern in the contributions. This inconsistency in others' contributions could lead to unpredictable payoffs and might be a reason for suboptimal gains.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a number of tokens that is proportional to the average contribution of the other players. This way, I can balance the risk of over-contributing when others contribute less and potentially benefit more when others contribute more. Additionally, I should also consider the total tokens I have, ensuring not to deplete my private collection too quickly. By adapting to the behavior of other players and maintaining a strategic balance, I aim to optimize my long-term gains.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 3 (myself) has been consistently contributing 5 or 6 tokens to the public pot in each round. While this strategy might seem fair and consistent, it doesn't seem to be optimizing for the highest possible gain. The contributions from other players are variable, and there are instances where contributing more or less might result in a higher net gain.\n\nTo mitigate this potential failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of the other players. A possible high-level plan is to contribute tokens in a way that maximizes the ratio of the public good payoff to my personal contribution. This can be achieved by estimating the average contribution of other players and contributing just enough to push the total pot to a point where the multiplier (2) will have a significant impact on the public good, while not over-contributing and risking a lower individual return. Additionally, I should consider the potential for free-riders, who contribute little or nothing, and adjust my contribution accordingly to avoid subsidizing their gains.\nReflections:\n-Upon reviewing the historical data, a pattern emerges in my contribution strategy: I tend to contribute 5 or 6 tokens consistently, regardless of the actions of other players. This static behavior might be causing me to lose out on potential gains when other players contribute more tokens, as my share of the public good remains relatively constant. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. If others are contributing more, I should consider increasing my contribution to maximize the multiplier effect. Conversely, if others contribute less, I should decrease my contribution to preserve my tokens. This dynamic approach will allow me to better align my actions with the potential payoffs in each round.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy as player_3 has been relatively inconsistent, alternating between contributing 5 and 6 tokens. This inconsistency might be causing me to miss out on potential gains or contribute more than necessary at times. A possible reason for this failure is the lack of a clear, optimized strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose a new high-level plan: adopt a conditional contribution strategy. Contribute the minimum amount (e.g., 4 tokens) when the average contribution of other players is low, and contribute slightly more (e.g., 5 tokens) when the average is higher, aiming to maximize the public good multiplier while minimizing personal loss. This strategy will adapt to the behavior of other players and potentially lead to more consistent gains. Additionally, I should continuously update my strategy based on the evolving contribution patterns of the other players throughout the game.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for the failure or suboptimal performance is that Player 3 is not consistently contributing the optimal number of tokens to maximize their gains. There seems to be no clear pattern in Player 3's contributions, which results in missed opportunities for higher payoffs when other players contribute more tokens to the public pot. To mitigate this failure, Player 3 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing the same number of tokens as the average contribution of the other players, or contributing slightly more to encourage others to contribute more as well. This way, Player 3 can potentially benefit from a larger public pot while minimizing personal losses.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 3 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot consistently, with a slight tendency to contribute more tokens when others do the same. However, this strategy doesn't seem to be maximizing my individual gain, as my token count is not consistently increasing and sometimes decreases due to higher contributions without a corresponding increase in the public pot. The main reason for this could be the lack of coordination or strategic adaptation to other players' contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A possible high-level plan is to contribute only when the expected public good payoff is likely to be higher than the cost of my contribution. This can be achieved by estimating the average contribution of others and contributing just enough to push the public pot to a threshold where the multiplier will result in a higher payoff. Additionally, I should also consider occasionally deviating from this strategy to exploit potential free riders, contributing less when others contribute significantly more, and more when others contribute less, to balance the benefits and avoid being consistently exploited.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3 is contributing tokens to the public pot with some consistency, but not always in a way that optimizes their gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens results in a lower gain per token contributed (e.g., round 2) and times when contributing less would have yielded a higher gain (e.g., round 7). This suggests a lack of a clear strategy or an inability to adapt to the varying contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more strategic approach. A high-level plan could be to estimate the average contribution of other players and adjust their own contribution to maximize the benefit from the public good multiplier. If the average contribution is high, player_3 should contribute more to take advantage of the larger pot. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, they should contribute less to conserve tokens. Additionally, player_3 should consider the potential for free-ridership, where others might benefit from their contributions without contributing themselves, and adjust their strategy accordingly. This may involve occasionally contributing less to discourage such behavior or contributing more when it's likely to incentivize others to contribute as well.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 3 (myself) is contributing tokens to the public pot with some consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes individual gain. There seems to be a lack of strategic adaptation to the varying contributions of other players. For instance, when other players contribute more tokens, I also tend to contribute more, but this doesn't always result in the best outcome for me due to the even division of the public good payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. If others are contributing heavily, it might be more beneficial for me to contribute less, as the public good payoff will still be high and I can retain more tokens for myself. Conversely, if others are contributing less, I should consider increasing my contribution to potentially benefit more from the multiplier. Additionally, I should aim to maintain a balance between cooperation and self-interest, ensuring that my contributions are neither too high nor too low relative to the average contribution of other players. This way, I can optimize my token accumulation over the long run.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 3 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes individual gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. However, there are also rounds where contributing less might have been beneficial when others contributed fewer tokens, reducing the overall pot and thus the division cost.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. I should consider the average contribution of other players in previous rounds and adjust my contribution accordingly. If others are contributing more, I should lean towards contributing more to take advantage of the larger pot. Conversely, if others are contributing less, I should contribute less to minimize the loss in case the pot remains small. Additionally, I should factor in the potential for free-riding behavior from other players and be prepared to adjust my strategy if it seems they are consistently contributing less while benefiting from my contributions.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3 is not consistently optimizing their contribution strategy to maximize their token count. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher individual payoff (e.g., Round 2 and Round 7), and times when contributing fewer tokens would have been more beneficial (e.g., Round 14). The player seems to be alternating between contributing 4 and 5 tokens, without fully considering the impact of other players' contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A potential high-level plan is to estimate the average contribution of the other players and contribute just enough tokens to reach the point where the marginal benefit of the public good (2x the total contribution) starts to decline. This would likely involve contributing less than the average when others contribute more, and contributing more when others contribute less, to exploit their contributions and maximize individual gain. Additionally, player_3 should be prepared to adjust their strategy as the game progresses and observe patterns in other players' behavior.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 3 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some inconsistency. There seems to be no clear strategy in terms of how many tokens to contribute, as the contributions range from 2 to 6 tokens across the rounds. This inconsistent contribution pattern could lead to suboptimal gains, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good multiplier or account for other players' contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose adopting a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens, say 30%, to the public pot in each round. This way, I maintain a consistent strategy while adapting to my current token holdings. Additionally, I should also consider the contributions of other players, especially if they are consistently contributing more or less than me, and adjust my strategy accordingly to potentially exploit their behavior. This adaptive strategy should lead to more predictable and potentially higher gains over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 6 tokens. This inconsistency might be causing me to miss out on potential gains when others contribute more, or it could lead to over-contributing when others contribute less. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. A high-level plan would be to monitor the average contribution of other players over the last few rounds and contribute slightly less than that average to take advantage of their contributions while minimizing my own loss. This way, I can balance my participation in the public good while preserving my private tokens more effectively.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing their tokens. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot results in a lower individual gain (e.g., round 5) and times when contributing less results in a higher gain (e.g., round 14). This inconsistency could be due to a lack of a clear strategy or an underestimation of the impact of other players' contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more strategic approach. A high-level plan could be to estimate the average contribution of other players and contribute just enough to ensure the public pot multiplier (2) is utilized efficiently, without over-contributing. If the average contribution of others is high, player_3 should contribute close to the average to benefit from the larger public good. If the average is low, contributing slightly more than the average might be beneficial to incentivize others to contribute more. Additionally, player_3 should consider the potential for free-ridership and adjust contributions accordingly to not be exploited by others who contribute less.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 3's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing their tokens. There seems to be a lack of coordination with other players, as contributions are not always aligned with the highest or lowest contributions made by others. This leads to instances where Player 3's tokens are either underutilized in the public pot or not sufficiently benefiting from the public good.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 3 should adopt a more adaptive strategy. They should consider monitoring the average contribution of the other players and adjust their own contribution to be slightly below that average. This way, they can balance the benefit from the public good while minimizing the risk of over-contributing. Additionally, in rounds where contributions are very low, Player 3 might want to consider not contributing at all to preserve their tokens, as the public good multiplier might not result in a significant gain.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 3 (myself) has been contributing a varying number of tokens to the public pot, but not always in a way that optimizes personal gain. There seems to be a lack of a consistent strategy, as my contributions do not consistently align with the amounts that lead to the highest average return per token contributed. In some rounds, I contribute more tokens when others contribute less, which can result in a lower individual payoff due to the public good being divided among all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute tokens based on the average contribution of the other players. If the average contribution is low, I should contribute less to minimize the loss from a smaller public good. If the average contribution is high, I should contribute more to take advantage of the larger public good, while still expecting a higher individual payoff due to the division among fewer tokens. This way, I can adapt my strategy to the behavior of other players and potentially maximize my long-term token accumulation.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's strategy has been somewhat inconsistent, contributing anywhere from 2 to 6 tokens per round. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good dynamics. The game rewards cooperation when everyone contributes similarly, but player_3's contributions don't always align with the group's actions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_3 would be to adopt a more cooperative and predictable strategy. Player_3 should aim to contribute the same number of tokens as the average contribution of the other players in the previous round, with a small adjustment for the potential impact on the public pot. This way, player_3 can better coordinate with the group and potentially benefit from the multiplied public good without over-contributing or under-contributing. Additionally, if there's a trend of decreasing contributions, player_3 could gradually decrease contributions as well to conserve tokens, but always staying close to the group average.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 3 (you) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some inconsistency. There are instances where you contribute more tokens when others do the same, but there are also rounds where you contribute less. This inconsistent strategy might lead to suboptimal gains, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good multiplier or counteract free-riding behaviors from other players.\n\nA new high-level plan to mitigate this failure would be to adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. Start by observing the average contribution of other players over the last few rounds. If the average contribution is high, contribute just enough to ensure you benefit from the public good without over-contributing. If the average is low, consider contributing slightly more to potentially incentivize others to contribute and maximize the public good. Additionally, always ensure your contribution is slightly less than the highest contributor to avoid being exploited while still benefiting from their contribution. This way, you balance risk and reward more effectively.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is not consistently aligned with the optimal strategy for maximizing tokens. There are instances where player_3 contributes more tokens when others contribute less, and vice versa, which results in suboptimal gains. The optimal strategy in this public goods game would be to contribute the same amount as the average contribution of other players, as this would maximize the multiplication factor and thus the public good payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more adaptive strategy: observe the average contribution of the other players in each round and aim to match that average. This way, player_3 can better align with the collective action and potentially increase individual gains. Additionally, player_3 should consider the potential for free-riders, who contribute little or nothing, and adjust contributions accordingly to avoid subsidizing their gains without adequate return.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing their tokens. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual gain, and times when contributing less would have been more beneficial due to the total tokens contributed by other players. The player seems to be contributing an average of 4.2 tokens per round, without a clear pattern or adaptation to the actions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A potential high-level plan is to estimate the average contribution of the other players and contribute just enough tokens to reach the threshold where the public good multiplier (2) starts to decrease the individual gain per token contributed. This can be calculated as (total tokens contributed by others + 1) / 2, assuming a linear decrease in individual gain. Additionally, player_3 should also consider the current token balance and adjust contributions to balance between short-term gains and long-term sustainability.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 3's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, and times when contributing less would have been more beneficial. The player seems to be contributing an average amount of tokens without a clear pattern or consideration for the contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 3 should adopt a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to base contributions on the expected total tokens in the pot, taking into account the average contributions of other players. If the sum of other players' contributions suggests that the total will be close to a threshold that would result in a significantly higher public good payoff, Player 3 should contribute just enough to push the pot over that threshold. Conversely, if the expected total is already high or other players are contributing very little, Player 3 should contribute minimally to avoid subsidizing others without a proportional benefit. This strategy requires estimating the optimal contribution level based on the actions of others and the potential multipliers in the game.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 3 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their long-term gain. There seems to be a lack of strategic consistency, as contributions vary without a clear pattern, and in some rounds, Player 3 contributes less than the average tokens contributed by other players, which could lead to lower payoffs.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 3 should adopt a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute tokens to the public pot in a way that matches or slightly exceeds the average contribution of the other players. This strategy, known as \"tit-for-tat,\" aims to encourage cooperation and ensure a fair share of the public good payoff, while also punishing free-riding. By adapting to the average contribution of others, Player 3 can potentially increase their overall token count over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is inconsistent, ranging from 2 to 6 tokens per round. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively balance the trade-off between contributing to the public good and retaining tokens for personal gain. To mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more systematic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens or adjusting their contribution based on the average contribution of other players. This way, they can better predict the potential payoff and make more informed decisions that balance personal gain with the group's success.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 3 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that optimizes their long-term gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly. For example, in Round 21, contributing 10 tokens would have led to a higher payoff than contributing 3 tokens. \n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 3 should adopt a more strategic approach, taking into account the contributions of other players. A high-level plan could be to contribute a number of tokens that is slightly less than the average contribution of the other players, aiming to benefit from the multiplier without over-contributing. This strategy balances the risk of not contributing enough to benefit from the public good with the risk of contributing too much and potentially being exploited by free-riders. Additionally, Player 3 should be more aggressive in rounds where the total contribution is expected to be high, as the potential payoff from the multiplier is greater.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent. There seems to be no clear pattern in the number of tokens contributed, which results in missed opportunities for higher payoffs when other players contribute more tokens. To mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing the same amount as the average contribution of the other players or contributing slightly more to encourage others to contribute. This way, player_3 can potentially benefit from a larger public pot while minimizing personal loss. Additionally, monitoring the round-by-round changes in other players' contributions could help player_3 adapt their strategy dynamically.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is inconsistent, often alternating between contributing 3 or 4 tokens. This inconsistency might lead to suboptimal gains, as the player could potentially benefit more from adapting to the average contribution of other players or finding an equilibrium strategy that balances personal gain with the public good. To mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing slightly less than the average contribution of other players to exploit their potential cooperativeness while minimizing personal loss. Additionally, player_3 could consider adjusting contributions based on the pot size, contributing more when the pot is likely to result in a higher multiplier for the public good.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 3 (you) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes individual gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. For example, in Round 21, contributing 10 tokens would have led to a higher payoff than contributing 3 tokens, given the 26 tokens in the pot. Similarly, in Rounds 26 and 27, contributing fewer tokens than the average contributed by other players led to a higher gain.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach to token contribution. This strategy should consider the current round, the total tokens in the pot, and the average contribution of other players. If the pot size multiplied by 2 is expected to result in a higher gain than the tokens contributed, then contribute more tokens. Additionally, if other players are contributing significantly more tokens, it might be beneficial to match or slightly exceed their contributions to ensure a fair share of the public good payoff. This adaptive strategy aims to balance risk and reward while optimizing individual token accumulation.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, ranging from contributing as low as 1 token to as high as 6 tokens. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't seem to be based on a clear pattern or response to other players' contributions. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of tokens based on the average contribution of other players. This would help balance personal gain with contributing to the public good while avoiding extreme fluctuations in contribution. Additionally, monitoring the total tokens in the pot and adjusting contributions accordingly could lead to better long-term gains.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is inconsistent, often alternating between contributing 3 or 4 tokens. This inconsistency might be causing player_3 to miss out on potential higher payoffs when other players contribute more tokens to the pot. To mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the average contribution of other players in previous rounds and adjusting their contribution accordingly to maximize the benefit from the public good. For example, if the average contribution is high, player_3 should contribute more to take advantage of the larger pot, and if it's low, they might choose to contribute less to conserve tokens. Additionally, player_3 should also factor in the potential for free-ridership, as contributing too much when others contribute little could lead to lower individual payoffs.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 3 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that optimizes their long-term gain. There seems to be a lack of strategic consistency, with contributions fluctuating between low and high amounts without a clear pattern. This inconsistent behavior could result in missed opportunities for higher payoffs when the public pot is larger due to other players' higher contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 3 should adopt a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of their tokens to the public pot in each round, taking into account the average contribution of the other players. By doing so, they can maintain a balanced contribution that aligns with the group's efforts, maximizing the benefit from the public good while minimizing personal loss. Additionally, Player 3 should consider adjusting this percentage dynamically based on the game's progress and the observed behavior of other players to exploit any cooperative or selfish tendencies.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, ranging from contributing as low as 1 token to as high as 6 tokens. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't seem to exploit the potential of the public good effectively. A possible high-level plan to mitigate this failure is to adopt a more strategic and stable contribution pattern. Player_3 should aim to contribute a fixed percentage of their tokens, say 40%, to the public pot in each round. This way, they can balance personal gain with contributing to the public good, while also reducing the impact of other players' unpredictable behavior. Additionally, if the player observes a trend of others contributing less, they could adjust their contribution upward to potentially exploit the larger share of the multiplied pot.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, ranging from contributing as low as 1 token to as high as 6 tokens. This inconsistency could be a result of not effectively optimizing the balance between personal gain and contribution to the public good. A possible reason for the failure is that player_3 is not adapting well to the contributions of other players, leading to suboptimal gains.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_3 could be to adopt a more strategic approach based on the average contribution of other players. If the average contribution is high, player_3 should contribute slightly less to maximize personal gain while still benefiting from the public good. If the average contribution is low, player_3 should contribute slightly more to potentially stimulate a higher total contribution and maintain a fair balance between personal and collective benefit. This adaptive strategy should lead to more consistent and potentially higher gains over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 3's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing their tokens. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, and times when contributing fewer tokens would have been more beneficial. The player seems to be contributing an average of around 4 tokens per round, without a clear pattern or adaptation to other players' contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 3 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of the other players. A potential high-level plan is to contribute tokens in a way that balances the benefit of the public good with the risk of being exploited by free-riders. This can be achieved by:\n\n1. Monitoring the average contribution of other players: If others are contributing significantly less, Player 3 should consider reducing their contribution to avoid subsidizing others' gains.\n2. Adjusting contributions based on the pot size: When the pot is likely to result in a lower per-player payoff, Player 3 should contribute less to minimize losses.\n3. Anticipating and adapting to changes: If other players increase their contributions, Player 3 should also consider increasing theirs to take advantage of the larger potential public good.\n\nBy implementing this adaptive strategy, Player 3 can better align their contributions with the potential payoffs and minimize the risk of losing tokens unnecessarily.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, and times when contributing fewer tokens would have been more beneficial. The player seems to be contributing an average of 3.8 tokens per round, which might not always align with the optimal contribution level depending on the other players' actions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_3 could be to adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. This could involve calculating the expected public pot multiplication based on the average contributions of the other players and adjusting the own contribution to maximize the difference between the potential gain from the public good and the tokens contributed. Additionally, considering the long-term effects of contributing tokens, such as potential exploitation by free-riding players, might also be crucial for optimizing the strategy.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent. There are instances where player_3 contributes more tokens when others contribute less (e.g., round 11) and vice versa (e.g., round 21). This inconsistent behavior might be causing player_3 to miss out on potential gains when others contribute more, and conversely, lose tokens when others contribute less.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more strategic and stable approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of tokens, say 40%, to the public pot in each round. This way, player_3's contribution would be less affected by the fluctuations in others' contributions, ensuring a more consistent gain over time. Additionally, monitoring the average contribution of other players and adjusting the fixed percentage slightly based on that could further optimize the strategy.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, and times when contributing fewer tokens would have been more beneficial. The player seems to be contributing around the average amount, but not necessarily adapting to the contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. This could involve contributing slightly more than the average contribution of the other players when the total contribution is low, and contributing less when the total contribution is high. Additionally, player_3 should consider the potential impact of their contribution on the public good multiplier (2x) and aim to contribute just enough to ensure the multiplier is utilized efficiently, without over-contributing. By doing so, player_3 can potentially increase their average gain per round and accumulate more tokens over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, ranging from contributing as low as 1 token to as high as 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a result of not optimizing for the balance between personal gain and contributing to the public good. A possible reason for the failure is that player_3 is not effectively predicting the optimal contribution level that maximizes their long-term tokens while considering the actions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_3 could be to adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. This could involve tracking the average contribution of other players and contributing just enough tokens to ensure the public pot multiplier (2x) is reached, while not over-contributing. If the average contribution of others is high, player_3 should contribute slightly less to avoid being exploited. If the average is low, player_3 should contribute slightly more to encourage a higher total pot. Additionally, player_3 should consider the potential for free-riders and adjust contributions accordingly to minimize their impact on personal gains. This strategy aims to create a balance between cooperation and self-interest, leading to more consistent and optimal outcomes over the remaining rounds.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, ranging from 2 to 5 tokens per round. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively balance personal gain with contributing to the public good. To mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more consistent strategy, such as always contributing a fixed number of tokens (e.g., the average contribution of other players or a number that maximizes the expected return based on the multiplier and average contributions). This would help to optimize the balance between personal gain and group benefit while minimizing the impact of unpredictable contributions from other players.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, player_3 seems to be contributing tokens to the public pot with some consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes their gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. For example, in Round 12, contributing 5 tokens instead of 4 would have led to a higher gain, as the pot was larger and the extra token would have been multiplied by 2. Similarly, in Round 31, contributing fewer tokens when others contributed more could have been more beneficial.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the contributions of other players and adjusting their own contribution accordingly. If the majority of other players are contributing more tokens, player_3 should also contribute more to take advantage of the larger pot. Conversely, if others are contributing fewer tokens, player_3 should consider contributing less to retain more tokens for themselves. Additionally, player_3 should aim to balance their contributions to minimize the risk of having a lower gain when the pot is small. By adapting to the behavior of other players and the size of the pot, player_3 can optimize their long-term token accumulation.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, and times when contributing fewer tokens would have been more beneficial. The player seems to be contributing around the same number of tokens regardless of the other players' contributions, which can lead to missed opportunities for higher gains when others contribute more and lower gains when others contribute less.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more adaptive strategy. The new plan should involve observing the average contribution of the other players in each round and adjusting the contribution accordingly. If the average contribution is high, player_3 should contribute more to take advantage of the larger public pot. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_3 should contribute less to retain more tokens for personal gain. This way, player_3 can better align their actions with the potential payoffs and maximize overall tokens collected over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, ranging from 2 to 5 tokens across different rounds. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good dynamics. In some rounds, player_3 contributes more tokens when others contribute less, resulting in a lower individual gain due to the lower total in the pot. In contrast, in other rounds, player_3 contributes less when others contribute more, potentially missing out on a higher collective payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. A possible high-level plan is to monitor the average contribution of the other players and adjust contributions accordingly. If the average contribution is high, player_3 should contribute close to the average to maximize the benefit from the multiplied public pot. If the average contribution is low, player_3 should contribute minimally to conserve tokens, as the public good payoff will be smaller. This way, player_3 can balance between cooperation and self-interest, leading to more consistent and potentially better outcomes.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 3's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, and times when contributing fewer tokens would have been more beneficial.

A potential high-level plan is to estimate the average contribution of the other players and adjust own contribution to maintain a balance between the total tokens in the pot and the potential payoff. If the average contribution of others is high, Player 3 should contribute less to avoid free-ridership; if it's low, Player 3 should contribute more to capitalize on the multiplied payoff.

This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't seem to be based on a clear pattern or response to other players' contributions. To improve, player_3 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed amount that maximizes their expected gain, considering the average contribution of other players. For instance, if the average contribution is close to the optimal amount for maximizing the public good, player_3 should aim to contribute slightly less to exploit the others' contributions, and if the average is low, they should contribute more to potentially benefit from a higher multiplier.

This could involve tracking the average contribution of other players over the last few rounds and contributing just enough to ensure a marginal increase in the public pot, while still benefiting from the multiplied payoff. For instance, if the average contribution is around 3 tokens, player_3 could contribute 2 tokens to ensure a slightly lower total pot that still multiplies, but with less personal cost. This way, player_3 can balance between contributing to the public good and preserving private tokens. Additionally, player_3 should consider occasional higher contributions when it's likely that others will contribute significantly, to capitalize on a larger pot.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 3's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. For example, in Round 21, contributing 5 tokens instead of 3 would have led to a higher gain, as the pot was large (26 tokens) and the contribution was lower from other players. Similarly, in Round 31, contributing 5 tokens instead of 3 would have been beneficial with a 19-token pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 3 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the size of the public pot and the contributions of other players. A high-level plan could be to:\n\n1. Assess the average contribution of other players in recent rounds.\n2. Calculate the potential public pot size based on this average and decide on a contribution that would maximize the return, considering the 2x multiplier.\n3. If the public pot is likely to be large (e.g., when others are contributing more), increase contribution to take advantage of the higher potential payoff.\n4. If the public pot is likely to be small or other players are contributing less, consider conserving tokens to avoid diluting the individual gain.\n\nBy adjusting contributions based on these factors, Player 3 can potentially increase their overall token count over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 1 to 5 tokens.

A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of their current tokens, say 30%, to the public pot in each round. This way, they maintain a consistent strategy while adjusting their contribution based on their current token holdings. Additionally, they should monitor the average contribution of other players and, if it's consistently high, consider increasing their contribution to take advantage of the larger public pot. This adaptive strategy should lead to more predictable and potentially higher gains over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 3 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that optimizes their gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot.

If the average contribution of other players is high, Player 3 should contribute more to take advantage of the larger public good.

This would involve observing the average contribution of other players in recent rounds and adjusting player_3's contribution to match or slightly exceed that average. By doing so, player_3 can potentially benefit from larger public goods when others contribute more, while still maintaining a balanced risk-reward profile. Additionally, player_3 should consider contributing more tokens when the public pot can result in a higher multiplier (e.g., when the total contribution is close to an odd number, ensuring the multiplier will be 2 or higher). This adaptive and opportunistic strategy should lead to more consistent and potentially higher gains over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 3 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that optimizes their gains.

      "learnings": "Reflections:\n-Upon reviewing the historical data from Round 1, a possible reason for failure or suboptimal performance is that some players contributed more tokens than others, leading to an unequal distribution of the \"public good\" payoff. In this case, player_3 (myself) contributed 5 tokens, which was less than the average contribution. This might have resulted in a lower gain compared to players who contributed more.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan is to adopt a strategy that considers the average contribution of the group in each round. By aiming to contribute slightly above the average, I can potentially benefit from the higher multiplier while still receiving a fair share of the public good payoff. This strategy assumes that other players will also act rationally, seeking to optimize their gains. However, it's crucial to continuously adapt this strategy based on the evolving behavior of other players to ensure its effectiveness over multiple rounds.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the players are contributing varying amounts of tokens to the public pot. In Round 1, the average contribution was high, with a total of 29 tokens, while in Round 2, the average was lower at 27 tokens. You, as player_3, contributed 5 tokens in Round 1 and 6 tokens in Round 2, which was close to the average contribution in both rounds. However, your gains were lower than the average gain in both rounds, suggesting that contributing the same amount as others might not be the most optimal strategy.\n\nA possible reason for this outcome is that other players might be adjusting their contributions strategically, either by free-riding (contributing less) or by attempting to manipulate the public good by contributing more when they expect others to contribute less. This behavior can lead to inconsistent payoffs for you.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more dynamic and adaptive strategy. This could involve monitoring the average contribution of other players and adjusting your contribution to be slightly below the average. By doing so, you can potentially benefit from the public good while minimizing the risk of over-contributing when others are not. Additionally, consider the possibility of occasionally deviating from this strategy to exploit potential free-riders, contributing more when others contribute less, to encourage a more balanced contribution from the group.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the players, including myself as player_3, are contributing varying amounts of tokens to the public pot. In Round 1, the average contribution was high, leading to a larger public good payoff, but in Round 2 and Round 3, the average contribution decreased, resulting in lower payoffs. The inconsistency in player contributions suggests a lack of coordination or strategy among the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose a new high-level plan: adopt a consistent contribution strategy. A potential strategy could be to contribute a fixed percentage of my total tokens to the public pot in each round, say 20%, to balance between supporting the public good and retaining tokens for personal gain. This way, I can maintain a stable approach regardless of other players' actions, and potentially encourage others to adopt a similar strategy if they observe the stability and potential benefits. Additionally, I should monitor the average contribution of other players and adjust my strategy if it appears that a higher or lower contribution level would be more beneficial.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_3 (myself) is contributing tokens consistently without much variation in the number of tokens contributed (5, 6, 4, 5). This lack of adaptability might be causing me to miss out on potential higher payoffs when other players contribute more tokens, as my fixed contribution doesn't maximize the benefit from the public good multiplier. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A high-level plan would be to contribute a percentage of my tokens that is proportional to the average contribution of all players in the previous round, ensuring that I am more aligned with the group's behavior and can potentially benefit more from the public good. This way, when others contribute more, I contribute more, and vice versa, optimizing my overall gain over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 3 (myself) has been contributing a consistent amount of tokens to the public pot, with contributions ranging from 4 to 6 tokens. However, the total tokens contributed by all players in each round vary, and there seems to be no clear pattern in the contributions. This inconsistency in others' contributions could lead to unpredictable payoffs and might be a reason for suboptimal gains.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a number of tokens that is proportional to the average contribution of the other players. This way, I can balance the risk of over-contributing when others contribute less and potentially benefit more when others contribute more. Additionally, I should also consider the total tokens I have, ensuring not to deplete my private collection too quickly. By adapting to the behavior of other players and maintaining a strategic balance, I aim to optimize my long-term gains.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 3 (myself) has been consistently contributing 5 or 6 tokens to the public pot in each round. While this strategy might seem fair and consistent, it doesn't seem to be optimizing for the highest possible gain. The contributions from other players are variable, and there are instances where contributing more or less might result in a higher net gain.\n\nTo mitigate this potential failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of the other players. A possible high-level plan is to contribute tokens in a way that maximizes the ratio of the public good payoff to my personal contribution. This can be achieved by estimating the average contribution of other players and contributing just enough to push the total pot to a point where the multiplier (2) will have a significant impact on the public good, while not over-contributing and risking a lower individual return. Additionally, I should consider the potential for free-riders, who contribute little or nothing, and adjust my contribution accordingly to avoid subsidizing their gains.\nReflections:\n-Upon reviewing the historical data, a pattern emerges in my contribution strategy: I tend to contribute 5 or 6 tokens consistently, regardless of the actions of other players. This static behavior might be causing me to lose out on potential gains when other players contribute more tokens, as my share of the public good remains relatively constant. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. If others are contributing more, I should consider increasing my contribution to maximize the multiplier effect. Conversely, if others contribute less, I should decrease my contribution to preserve my tokens. This dynamic approach will allow me to better align my actions with the potential payoffs in each round.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy as player_3 has been relatively inconsistent, alternating between contributing 5 and 6 tokens. This inconsistency might be causing me to miss out on potential gains or contribute more than necessary at times. A possible reason for this failure is the lack of a clear, optimized strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose a new high-level plan: adopt a conditional contribution strategy. Contribute the minimum amount (e.g., 4 tokens) when the average contribution of other players is low, and contribute slightly more (e.g., 5 tokens) when the average is higher, aiming to maximize the public good multiplier while minimizing personal loss. This strategy will adapt to the behavior of other players and potentially lead to more consistent gains. Additionally, I should continuously update my strategy based on the evolving contribution patterns of the other players throughout the game.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for the failure or suboptimal performance is that Player 3 is not consistently contributing the optimal number of tokens to maximize their gains. There seems to be no clear pattern in Player 3's contributions, which results in missed opportunities for higher payoffs when other players contribute more tokens to the public pot. To mitigate this failure, Player 3 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing the same number of tokens as the average contribution of the other players, or contributing slightly more to encourage others to contribute more as well. This way, Player 3 can potentially benefit from a larger public pot while minimizing personal losses.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 3 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot consistently, with a slight tendency to contribute more tokens when others do the same. However, this strategy doesn't seem to be maximizing my individual gain, as my token count is not consistently increasing and sometimes decreases due to higher contributions without a corresponding increase in the public pot. The main reason for this could be the lack of coordination or strategic adaptation to other players' contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A possible high-level plan is to contribute only when the expected public good payoff is likely to be higher than the cost of my contribution. This can be achieved by estimating the average contribution of others and contributing just enough to push the public pot to a threshold where the multiplier will result in a higher payoff. Additionally, I should also consider occasionally deviating from this strategy to exploit potential free riders, contributing less when others contribute significantly more, and more when others contribute less, to balance the benefits and avoid being consistently exploited.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3 is contributing tokens to the public pot with some consistency, but not always in a way that optimizes their gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens results in a lower gain per token contributed (e.g., round 2) and times when contributing less would have yielded a higher gain (e.g., round 7). This suggests a lack of a clear strategy or an inability to adapt to the varying contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more strategic approach. A high-level plan could be to estimate the average contribution of other players and adjust their own contribution to maximize the benefit from the public good multiplier. If the average contribution is high, player_3 should contribute more to take advantage of the larger pot. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, they should contribute less to conserve tokens. Additionally, player_3 should consider the potential for free-ridership, where others might benefit from their contributions without contributing themselves, and adjust their strategy accordingly. This may involve occasionally contributing less to discourage such behavior or contributing more when it's likely to incentivize others to contribute as well.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 3 (myself) is contributing tokens to the public pot with some consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes individual gain. There seems to be a lack of strategic adaptation to the varying contributions of other players. For instance, when other players contribute more tokens, I also tend to contribute more, but this doesn't always result in the best outcome for me due to the even division of the public good payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. If others are contributing heavily, it might be more beneficial for me to contribute less, as the public good payoff will still be high and I can retain more tokens for myself. Conversely, if others are contributing less, I should consider increasing my contribution to potentially benefit more from the multiplier. Additionally, I should aim to maintain a balance between cooperation and self-interest, ensuring that my contributions are neither too high nor too low relative to the average contribution of other players. This way, I can optimize my token accumulation over the long run.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 3 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes individual gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. However, there are also rounds where contributing less might have been beneficial when others contributed fewer tokens, reducing the overall pot and thus the division cost.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. I should consider the average contribution of other players in previous rounds and adjust my contribution accordingly. If others are contributing more, I should lean towards contributing more to take advantage of the larger pot. Conversely, if others are contributing less, I should contribute less to minimize the loss in case the pot remains small. Additionally, I should factor in the potential for free-riding behavior from other players and be prepared to adjust my strategy if it seems they are consistently contributing less while benefiting from my contributions.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3 is not consistently optimizing their contribution strategy to maximize their token count. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher individual payoff (e.g., Round 2 and Round 7), and times when contributing fewer tokens would have been more beneficial (e.g., Round 14). The player seems to be alternating between contributing 4 and 5 tokens, without fully considering the impact of other players' contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A potential high-level plan is to estimate the average contribution of the other players and contribute just enough tokens to reach the point where the marginal benefit of the public good (2x the total contribution) starts to decline. This would likely involve contributing less than the average when others contribute more, and contributing more when others contribute less, to exploit their contributions and maximize individual gain. Additionally, player_3 should be prepared to adjust their strategy as the game progresses and observe patterns in other players' behavior.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 3 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some inconsistency. There seems to be no clear strategy in terms of how many tokens to contribute, as the contributions range from 2 to 6 tokens across the rounds. This inconsistent contribution pattern could lead to suboptimal gains, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good multiplier or account for other players' contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose adopting a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens, say 30%, to the public pot in each round. This way, I maintain a consistent strategy while adapting to my current token holdings. Additionally, I should also consider the contributions of other players, especially if they are consistently contributing more or less than me, and adjust my strategy accordingly to potentially exploit their behavior. This adaptive strategy should lead to more predictable and potentially higher gains over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 6 tokens. This inconsistency might be causing me to miss out on potential gains when others contribute more, or it could lead to over-contributing when others contribute less. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. A high-level plan would be to monitor the average contribution of other players over the last few rounds and contribute slightly less than that average to take advantage of their contributions while minimizing my own loss. This way, I can balance my participation in the public good while preserving my private tokens more effectively.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing their tokens. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot results in a lower individual gain (e.g., round 5) and times when contributing less results in a higher gain (e.g., round 14). This inconsistency could be due to a lack of a clear strategy or an underestimation of the impact of other players' contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more strategic approach. A high-level plan could be to estimate the average contribution of other players and contribute just enough to ensure the public pot multiplier (2) is utilized efficiently, without over-contributing. If the average contribution of others is high, player_3 should contribute close to the average to benefit from the larger public good. If the average is low, contributing slightly more than the average might be beneficial to incentivize others to contribute more. Additionally, player_3 should consider the potential for free-ridership and adjust contributions accordingly to not be exploited by others who contribute less.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 3's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing their tokens. There seems to be a lack of coordination with other players, as contributions are not always aligned with the highest or lowest contributions made by others. This leads to instances where Player 3's tokens are either underutilized in the public pot or not sufficiently benefiting from the public good.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 3 should adopt a more adaptive strategy. They should consider monitoring the average contribution of the other players and adjust their own contribution to be slightly below that average. This way, they can balance the benefit from the public good while minimizing the risk of over-contributing. Additionally, in rounds where contributions are very low, Player 3 might want to consider not contributing at all to preserve their tokens, as the public good multiplier might not result in a significant gain.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 3 (myself) has been contributing a varying number of tokens to the public pot, but not always in a way that optimizes personal gain. There seems to be a lack of a consistent strategy, as my contributions do not consistently align with the amounts that lead to the highest average return per token contributed. In some rounds, I contribute more tokens when others contribute less, which can result in a lower individual payoff due to the public good being divided among all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute tokens based on the average contribution of the other players. If the average contribution is low, I should contribute less to minimize the loss from a smaller public good. If the average contribution is high, I should contribute more to take advantage of the larger public good, while still expecting a higher individual payoff due to the division among fewer tokens. This way, I can adapt my strategy to the behavior of other players and potentially maximize my long-term token accumulation.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's strategy has been somewhat inconsistent, contributing anywhere from 2 to 6 tokens per round. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good dynamics. The game rewards cooperation when everyone contributes similarly, but player_3's contributions don't always align with the group's actions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_3 would be to adopt a more cooperative and predictable strategy. Player_3 should aim to contribute the same number of tokens as the average contribution of the other players in the previous round, with a small adjustment for the potential impact on the public pot. This way, player_3 can better coordinate with the group and potentially benefit from the multiplied public good without over-contributing or under-contributing. Additionally, if there's a trend of decreasing contributions, player_3 could gradually decrease contributions as well to conserve tokens, but always staying close to the group average.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 3 (you) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some inconsistency. There are instances where you contribute more tokens when others do the same, but there are also rounds where you contribute less. This inconsistent strategy might lead to suboptimal gains, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good multiplier or counteract free-riding behaviors from other players.\n\nA new high-level plan to mitigate this failure would be to adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. Start by observing the average contribution of other players over the last few rounds. If the average contribution is high, contribute just enough to ensure you benefit from the public good without over-contributing. If the average is low, consider contributing slightly more to potentially incentivize others to contribute and maximize the public good. Additionally, always ensure your contribution is slightly less than the highest contributor to avoid being exploited while still benefiting from their contribution. This way, you balance risk and reward more effectively.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is not consistently aligned with the optimal strategy for maximizing tokens. There are instances where player_3 contributes more tokens when others contribute less, and vice versa, which results in suboptimal gains. The optimal strategy in this public goods game would be to contribute the same amount as the average contribution of other players, as this would maximize the multiplication factor and thus the public good payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more adaptive strategy: observe the average contribution of the other players in each round and aim to match that average. This way, player_3 can better align with the collective action and potentially increase individual gains. Additionally, player_3 should consider the potential for free-riders, who contribute little or nothing, and adjust contributions accordingly to avoid subsidizing their gains without adequate return.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing their tokens. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual gain, and times when contributing less would have been more beneficial due to the total tokens contributed by other players. The player seems to be contributing an average of 4.2 tokens per round, without a clear pattern or adaptation to the actions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A potential high-level plan is to estimate the average contribution of the other players and contribute just enough tokens to reach the threshold where the public good multiplier (2) starts to decrease the individual gain per token contributed. This can be calculated as (total tokens contributed by others + 1) / 2, assuming a linear decrease in individual gain. Additionally, player_3 should also consider the current token balance and adjust contributions to balance between short-term gains and long-term sustainability.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 3's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, and times when contributing less would have been more beneficial. The player seems to be contributing an average amount of tokens without a clear pattern or consideration for the contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 3 should adopt a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to base contributions on the expected total tokens in the pot, taking into account the average contributions of other players. If the sum of other players' contributions suggests that the total will be close to a threshold that would result in a significantly higher public good payoff, Player 3 should contribute just enough to push the pot over that threshold. Conversely, if the expected total is already high or other players are contributing very little, Player 3 should contribute minimally to avoid subsidizing others without a proportional benefit. This strategy requires estimating the optimal contribution level based on the actions of others and the potential multipliers in the game.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 3 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their long-term gain. There seems to be a lack of strategic consistency, as contributions vary without a clear pattern, and in some rounds, Player 3 contributes less than the average tokens contributed by other players, which could lead to lower payoffs.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 3 should adopt a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute tokens to the public pot in a way that matches or slightly exceeds the average contribution of the other players. This strategy, known as \"tit-for-tat,\" aims to encourage cooperation and ensure a fair share of the public good payoff, while also punishing free-riding. By adapting to the average contribution of others, Player 3 can potentially increase their overall token count over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is inconsistent, ranging from 2 to 6 tokens per round. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively balance the trade-off between contributing to the public good and retaining tokens for personal gain. To mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more systematic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens or adjusting their contribution based on the average contribution of other players. This way, they can better predict the potential payoff and make more informed decisions that balance personal gain with the group's success.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 3 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that optimizes their long-term gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly. For example, in Round 21, contributing 10 tokens would have led to a higher payoff than contributing 3 tokens. \n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 3 should adopt a more strategic approach, taking into account the contributions of other players. A high-level plan could be to contribute a number of tokens that is slightly less than the average contribution of the other players, aiming to benefit from the multiplier without over-contributing. This strategy balances the risk of not contributing enough to benefit from the public good with the risk of contributing too much and potentially being exploited by free-riders. Additionally, Player 3 should be more aggressive in rounds where the total contribution is expected to be high, as the potential payoff from the multiplier is greater.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent. There seems to be no clear pattern in the number of tokens contributed, which results in missed opportunities for higher payoffs when other players contribute more tokens. To mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing the same amount as the average contribution of the other players or contributing slightly more to encourage others to contribute. This way, player_3 can potentially benefit from a larger public pot while minimizing personal loss. Additionally, monitoring the round-by-round changes in other players' contributions could help player_3 adapt their strategy dynamically.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is inconsistent, often alternating between contributing 3 or 4 tokens. This inconsistency might lead to suboptimal gains, as the player could potentially benefit more from adapting to the average contribution of other players or finding an equilibrium strategy that balances personal gain with the public good. To mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing slightly less than the average contribution of other players to exploit their potential cooperativeness while minimizing personal loss. Additionally, player_3 could consider adjusting contributions based on the pot size, contributing more when the pot is likely to result in a higher multiplier for the public good.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 3 (you) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes individual gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. For example, in Round 21, contributing 10 tokens would have led to a higher payoff than contributing 3 tokens, given the 26 tokens in the pot. Similarly, in Rounds 26 and 27, contributing fewer tokens than the average contributed by other players led to a higher gain.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach to token contribution. This strategy should consider the current round, the total tokens in the pot, and the average contribution of other players. If the pot size multiplied by 2 is expected to result in a higher gain than the tokens contributed, then contribute more tokens. Additionally, if other players are contributing significantly more tokens, it might be beneficial to match or slightly exceed their contributions to ensure a fair share of the public good payoff. This adaptive strategy aims to balance risk and reward while optimizing individual token accumulation.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, ranging from contributing as low as 1 token to as high as 6 tokens. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't seem to be based on a clear pattern or response to other players' contributions. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of tokens based on the average contribution of other players. This would help balance personal gain with contributing to the public good while avoiding extreme fluctuations in contribution. Additionally, monitoring the total tokens in the pot and adjusting contributions accordingly could lead to better long-term gains.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is inconsistent, often alternating between contributing 3 or 4 tokens. This inconsistency might be causing player_3 to miss out on potential higher payoffs when other players contribute more tokens to the pot. To mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the average contribution of other players in previous rounds and adjusting their contribution accordingly to maximize the benefit from the public good. For example, if the average contribution is high, player_3 should contribute more to take advantage of the larger pot, and if it's low, they might choose to contribute less to conserve tokens. Additionally, player_3 should also factor in the potential for free-ridership, as contributing too much when others contribute little could lead to lower individual payoffs.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 3 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that optimizes their long-term gain. There seems to be a lack of strategic consistency, with contributions fluctuating between low and high amounts without a clear pattern. This inconsistent behavior could result in missed opportunities for higher payoffs when the public pot is larger due to other players' higher contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 3 should adopt a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of their tokens to the public pot in each round, taking into account the average contribution of the other players. By doing so, they can maintain a balanced contribution that aligns with the group's efforts, maximizing the benefit from the public good while minimizing personal loss. Additionally, Player 3 should consider adjusting this percentage dynamically based on the game's progress and the observed behavior of other players to exploit any cooperative or selfish tendencies.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, ranging from contributing as low as 1 token to as high as 6 tokens. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't seem to exploit the potential of the public good effectively. A possible high-level plan to mitigate this failure is to adopt a more strategic and stable contribution pattern. Player_3 should aim to contribute a fixed percentage of their tokens, say 40%, to the public pot in each round. This way, they can balance personal gain with contributing to the public good, while also reducing the impact of other players' unpredictable behavior. Additionally, if the player observes a trend of others contributing less, they could adjust their contribution upward to potentially exploit the larger share of the multiplied pot.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, ranging from contributing as low as 1 token to as high as 6 tokens. This inconsistency could be a result of not effectively optimizing the balance between personal gain and contribution to the public good. A possible reason for the failure is that player_3 is not adapting well to the contributions of other players, leading to suboptimal gains.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_3 could be to adopt a more strategic approach based on the average contribution of other players. If the average contribution is high, player_3 should contribute slightly less to maximize personal gain while still benefiting from the public good. If the average contribution is low, player_3 should contribute slightly more to potentially stimulate a higher total contribution and maintain a fair balance between personal and collective benefit. This adaptive strategy should lead to more consistent and potentially higher gains over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 3's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing their tokens. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, and times when contributing fewer tokens would have been more beneficial. The player seems to be contributing an average of around 4 tokens per round, without a clear pattern or adaptation to other players' contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 3 should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of the other players. A potential high-level plan is to contribute tokens in a way that balances the benefit of the public good with the risk of being exploited by free-riders. This can be achieved by:\n\n1. Monitoring the average contribution of other players: If others are contributing significantly less, Player 3 should consider reducing their contribution to avoid subsidizing others' gains.\n2. Adjusting contributions based on the pot size: When the pot is likely to result in a lower per-player payoff, Player 3 should contribute less to minimize losses.\n3. Anticipating and adapting to changes: If other players increase their contributions, Player 3 should also consider increasing theirs to take advantage of the larger potential public good.\n\nBy implementing this adaptive strategy, Player 3 can better align their contributions with the potential payoffs and minimize the risk of losing tokens unnecessarily.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, and times when contributing fewer tokens would have been more beneficial. The player seems to be contributing an average of 3.8 tokens per round, which might not always align with the optimal contribution level depending on the other players' actions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_3 could be to adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. This could involve calculating the expected public pot multiplication based on the average contributions of the other players and adjusting the own contribution to maximize the difference between the potential gain from the public good and the tokens contributed. Additionally, considering the long-term effects of contributing tokens, such as potential exploitation by free-riding players, might also be crucial for optimizing the strategy.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent. There are instances where player_3 contributes more tokens when others contribute less (e.g., round 11) and vice versa (e.g., round 21). This inconsistent behavior might be causing player_3 to miss out on potential gains when others contribute more, and conversely, lose tokens when others contribute less.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more strategic and stable approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of tokens, say 40%, to the public pot in each round. This way, player_3's contribution would be less affected by the fluctuations in others' contributions, ensuring a more consistent gain over time. Additionally, monitoring the average contribution of other players and adjusting the fixed percentage slightly based on that could further optimize the strategy.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, and times when contributing fewer tokens would have been more beneficial. The player seems to be contributing around the average amount, but not necessarily adapting to the contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. This could involve contributing slightly more than the average contribution of the other players when the total contribution is low, and contributing less when the total contribution is high. Additionally, player_3 should consider the potential impact of their contribution on the public good multiplier (2x) and aim to contribute just enough to ensure the multiplier is utilized efficiently, without over-contributing. By doing so, player_3 can potentially increase their average gain per round and accumulate more tokens over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, ranging from contributing as low as 1 token to as high as 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a result of not optimizing for the balance between personal gain and contributing to the public good. A possible reason for the failure is that player_3 is not effectively predicting the optimal contribution level that maximizes their long-term tokens while considering the actions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_3 could be to adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. This could involve tracking the average contribution of other players and contributing just enough tokens to ensure the public pot multiplier (2x) is reached, while not over-contributing. If the average contribution of others is high, player_3 should contribute slightly less to avoid being exploited. If the average is low, player_3 should contribute slightly more to encourage a higher total pot. Additionally, player_3 should consider the potential for free-riders and adjust contributions accordingly to minimize their impact on personal gains. This strategy aims to create a balance between cooperation and self-interest, leading to more consistent and optimal outcomes over the remaining rounds.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, ranging from 2 to 5 tokens per round. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively balance personal gain with contributing to the public good. To mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more consistent strategy, such as always contributing a fixed number of tokens (e.g., the average contribution of other players or a number that maximizes the expected return based on the multiplier and average contributions). This would help to optimize the balance between personal gain and group benefit while minimizing the impact of unpredictable contributions from other players.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, player_3 seems to be contributing tokens to the public pot with some consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes their gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. For example, in Round 12, contributing 5 tokens instead of 4 would have led to a higher gain, as the pot was larger and the extra token would have been multiplied by 2. Similarly, in Round 31, contributing fewer tokens when others contributed more could have been more beneficial.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the contributions of other players and adjusting their own contribution accordingly. If the majority of other players are contributing more tokens, player_3 should also contribute more to take advantage of the larger pot. Conversely, if others are contributing fewer tokens, player_3 should consider contributing less to retain more tokens for themselves. Additionally, player_3 should aim to balance their contributions to minimize the risk of having a lower gain when the pot is small. By adapting to the behavior of other players and the size of the pot, player_3 can optimize their long-term token accumulation.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, and times when contributing fewer tokens would have been more beneficial.

The new plan should involve observing the average contribution of the other players in each round and adjusting the contribution accordingly. If the average contribution is high, player_3 should contribute more to take advantage of the larger public pot. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_3 should contribute less to retain more tokens for personal gain.

This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good dynamics.

In contrast, in other rounds, player_3 contributes less when others contribute more, potentially missing out on a higher collective payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. A possible high-level plan is to monitor the average contribution of the other players and adjust contributions accordingly. If the average contribution is high, player_3 should contribute close to the average to maximize the benefit from the multiplied public pot. If the average contribution is low, player_3 should contribute minimally to conserve tokens, as the public good payoff will be smaller.

This could involve tracking the average contribution of other players over the last few rounds and contributing just enough to ensure a marginal increase in the public pot, while still benefiting from the multiplied payoff. For instance, if the average contribution is around 3 tokens, player_3 could contribute 2 tokens to ensure a slightly lower total pot that still multiplies, but with less personal cost. This way, player_3 can balance between contributing to the public good and preserving private tokens. Additionally, player_3 should consider occasional higher contributions when it's likely that others will contribute significantly, to capitalize on a larger pot.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 3's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot.

Additionally, they should monitor the average contribution of other players and, if it's consistently high, consider increasing their contribution to take advantage of the larger public pot. This adaptive strategy should lead to more predictable and potentially higher gains over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 3 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that optimizes their gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. For example, in Round 16, contributing 4 tokens instead of 3 would have led to the same public pot but a higher individual gain. Similarly, in Round 17, contributing 5 tokens instead of 3 would have been beneficial. \n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 3 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the contributions of other players and adjusting their own contribution to maximize the potential return. If the average contribution of other players is high, Player 3 should contribute more to take advantage of the larger public good. Conversely, if other players are contributing less, Player 3 should also contribute less to avoid free-riding by others. This dynamic adjustment strategy should lead to more optimal gains over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 1 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good dynamics. In some rounds, player_3 contributes more tokens when others contribute less, leading to a lower individual gain due to the lower total pot. \n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_3 would be to adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. This could involve monitoring the average contribution of other players and contributing just enough to ensure a slightly higher than average share of the public good payoff, while still benefiting from the multiplication factor. For instance, if the average contribution of others is 3 tokens, player_3 could contribute 4 tokens to ensure a slightly larger share without over-contributing when others are not. Additionally, player_3 should consider contributing more when others contribute significantly more, to take advantage of the larger pot. This way, player_3 can balance risk and reward more effectively and potentially increase overall token accumulation.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with a tendency to contribute 3 or 4 tokens frequently. This approach seems to result in average gains per round. A possible reason for suboptimal performance is that player_3 is not effectively adapting to the contributions of other players, which could lead to missed opportunities for higher payoffs when others contribute more tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_3 could be to adopt a more dynamic strategy. This would involve observing the average contribution of other players in recent rounds and adjusting player_3's contribution to match or slightly exceed that average. By doing so, player_3 can potentially benefit from larger public goods when others contribute more, while still maintaining a balanced risk-reward profile. Additionally, player_3 should consider contributing more tokens when the public pot can result in a higher multiplier (e.g., when the total contribution is close to an odd number, ensuring the multiplier will be 2 or higher). This adaptive and opportunistic strategy should lead to more consistent and potentially higher gains over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 3 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that optimizes their gains. There seems to be a lack of strategic consistency, as Player 3's contributions fluctuate without a clear pattern, sometimes matching the highest contributions and other times contributing less. This inconsistent behavior could lead to missed opportunities for higher payoffs when the public pot is larger due to other players' higher contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 3 should adopt a more strategic approach. A high-level plan could be to monitor the average contribution of the other players and adjust their own contribution to be slightly below this average. This strategy allows Player 3 to benefit from the public good without over-contributing and potentially losing tokens when others contribute less. Additionally, Player 3 should consider contributing more when the total tokens in the pot would result in a higher multiplier, ensuring a better return on investment. By adopting a more adaptive and calculated approach, Player 3 can potentially increase their overall token count over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 1 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a result of not effectively anticipating the collective contributions of other players or not optimizing for the balance between personal gain and group benefit. To mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more consistent and strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens based on the expected total contribution from others. This would help to maximize their average gain per round while minimizing the risk of over-contributing when others contribute less. Additionally, player_3 should consider the potential for free-ridership and adjust their contributions accordingly to avoid being exploited while still benefiting from the public good.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_3's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 1 to 5 tokens per round. This inconsistency could be a result of not effectively anticipating the collective contributions of other players or not having a clear strategy to optimize personal gain. To mitigate this failure, player_3 should adopt a more consistent strategy, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens based on the expected return, or adjusting their contribution based on the average contribution of other players in previous rounds. This way, player_3 can better predict their gains and potentially maximize their tokens over time.\n",

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-Upon reviewing the historical data from Round 1, a possible reason for failure or suboptimal performance is that some players, including myself as player_4, contributed more tokens than others without receiving a proportionally higher benefit. In this case, I contributed 8 tokens, which was the highest among all players, but the public good payoff was evenly divided among all players, resulting in a lower individual gain compared to those who contributed fewer tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, a new high-level plan would be to adopt a more strategic and cooperative approach. This could involve observing the contribution patterns of other players and adjusting my contribution based on their behavior. If others tend to contribute less, I should consider contributing less as well to avoid over-contributing and receiving a lower per-token return. Additionally, I should aim for a balance between contributing to the public good and retaining tokens for personal gain, especially if I notice a consistent free-rider pattern among other players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that players are contributing varying amounts of tokens to the public pot. In Round 1, you contributed more tokens (8) than the average contribution, which led to a lower individual gain compared to the other players who contributed less. In Round 2, you contributed less (5) and received a higher gain. This suggests that contributing fewer tokens than the average can be a more beneficial strategy when others are contributing more.\n\nTo mitigate the potential failure of over-contributing and receiving a lower share of the public good, a new high-level plan is to adopt a conditional contribution strategy. This strategy involves observing the average contribution of other players in each round and contributing slightly less than that average. By doing so, you can benefit from the public good while minimizing the risk of over-contributing. Additionally, you should adapt this strategy based on the changing behavior of other players to ensure continued advantage.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the players, including myself as player_4, are contributing varying amounts of tokens to the public pot. In Round 1, I contributed the most tokens, but in Rounds 2 and 3, my contribution was lower, and more in line with the other players. The public pot's total tokens also decreased in subsequent rounds, suggesting that players might be adjusting their contributions based on previous outcomes.\n\nA possible reason for failure or suboptimal performance is that players are not consistently contributing their tokens in a way that maximizes the public good payoff. This could be due to a lack of coordination or an attempt to exploit others' contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan is to adopt a more strategic and cooperative approach. I should aim to contribute a consistent amount of tokens, close to the average contribution of the other players, to encourage stability in the public pot. Additionally, I should monitor the changes in other players' contributions and adjust my strategy accordingly, while also factoring in the potential for others to do the same. This way, I can strive for a balance between maximizing the public good and protecting my own tokens.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been relatively consistent, contributing 5 tokens in three out of four rounds and 8 tokens in the first round. While this strategy has resulted in gains, it seems that my contributions are not always aligned with the highest or lowest contributions from other players, which could lead to suboptimal outcomes. In some cases, contributing more when others contribute less could lead to a higher public pot multiplier, potentially increasing my share of the payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose a new high-level plan: adapt my contribution based on the average contribution of the other players. If the average contribution is low, I should contribute more to take advantage of the higher multiplier. If the average contribution is high, I should contribute less to minimize my personal loss while still benefiting from the public good. This way, I can dynamically adjust my strategy to better align with the behavior of other players and potentially maximize my gains.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (myself) has been contributing a consistent amount of tokens (5 or 6) to the public pot in each round. However, the contributions of the other players have varied, sometimes significantly. This suggests that a fixed contribution strategy might not be optimal, as it doesn't adapt to the varying contributions of others. A possible reason for failure is the lack of adaptability and the inability to exploit the potential benefits when other players contribute more.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose a new high-level plan: adopt a dynamic contribution strategy that takes into account the average contribution of the other players in each round. If the average contribution is high, I should contribute more to maximize the public good payoff. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, I should contribute less to conserve my tokens. This way, I can better align my actions with the potential benefits and adapt to the changing behavior of other players.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (you) has been consistently contributing 5 tokens in the last three rounds, while the contributions of other players have varied. This static strategy might lead to suboptimal outcomes because it doesn't adapt to the changing contributions of other players. A possible reason for this could be a lack of dynamic decision-making based on the observed behavior of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan is to adopt a more adaptive strategy. This could involve contributing a number of tokens that aligns with the average contribution of the other players in each round. By doing so, you can potentially maximize your gain when others contribute more and minimize losses when they contribute less. Additionally, consider contributing slightly more when the total contribution is close to a multiple of 5, as the public good multiplier (2) would lead to a higher payoff for all players. This way, you can balance between cooperation and personal gain more effectively.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (myself) has been contributing a relatively consistent amount of tokens to the public pot, usually around 5 or 6 tokens. However, there seems to be a lack of strategic adaptation to the varying contributions of other players. In some rounds, contributing the same amount as others could lead to a more equal division of the public good payoff, while in other rounds, contributing more or less might be beneficial.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A potential high-level plan is to calculate the average contribution of the other players and adjust my contribution to be slightly above or below that average, depending on whether the total contribution is closer to a threshold that would result in a higher or lower multiplier for the public good. This way, I can potentially exploit the contributions of more cooperative or selfish players while minimizing the risk of over-contributing. Additionally, I should consider the long-term implications of my actions, as other players may also adapt their strategies, and aim for a balance between cooperation and self-interest.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (myself) has been contributing a relatively consistent number of tokens to the public pot, usually around 5 or 6. However, there seems to be a lack of strategic adaptation to the varying contributions of other players. This rigidity in contribution might lead to suboptimal outcomes, as I'm not maximizing the potential gain from the public good when others contribute more tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A high-level plan would be to contribute a percentage of my tokens that is proportional to the average contribution of all players in a given round. This way, I can ensure that my investment aligns with the potential return from the public good, maximizing my gain while minimizing the risk of exploitation. Additionally, I should consider contributing slightly more when others contribute less to encourage higher collective contributions, as the public good multiplier (2) makes it beneficial for all when the pot is larger.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (you) has been consistently contributing around 5 tokens per round, with a few instances of contributing 4 or 6 tokens. This strategy seems to result in an average gain of around 5 to 6 tokens per round. However, there is a potential issue with adaptability to other players' contributions. For example, in Round 2, when other players contributed more tokens, you could have potentially gained more by contributing more as well. \n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more dynamic strategy. This would involve observing the average contribution of other players in the previous round and adjusting your contribution to be slightly below that average. This way, you can benefit from the higher public pot without over-contributing and risking a lower individual gain. Additionally, if the average contribution decreases, you can maintain or slightly increase your contribution to potentially exploit the lower overall contribution from others. This adaptive approach should help optimize gains while minimizing the risk of over-contributing.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (you) has been consistently contributing around 5 tokens per round, with a few instances of contributing 4 or 6 tokens. This strategy seems to result in an average gain of around 5 to 6 tokens per round. However, there is a potential issue with adaptability to other players' contributions. For example, in Round 2, when other players contributed more tokens, you could have potentially gained more by contributing more as well. \n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more dynamic strategy. This would involve observing the average contribution of other players in the previous round and adjusting your contribution to be slightly below that average. This way, you can benefit from the higher public pot while minimizing the risk of over-contributing when others do not. Additionally, consider contributing slightly more when the total contribution in the previous round was particularly high, as this could indicate a potential for a larger public good payoff.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4 is contributing tokens to the public pot consistently, but not always optimally. There seems to be a lack of adaptability in response to the varying contributions of other players. For instance, in rounds where other players contribute more tokens, player_4 could potentially gain more by contributing slightly more as well. To mitigate this failure, a new plan could involve using a more dynamic strategy: player_4 should observe the average contribution of the other players and aim to contribute slightly above that average to benefit from the higher multiplier without over-contributing. This way, player_4 can better align with the overall group effort and potentially increase their gains.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (you) has been contributing a relatively consistent amount of tokens to the public pot, usually around 4 or 5 tokens per round. However, the total tokens in the pot have varied significantly, and your gains have not consistently increased. This suggests that there might be a lack of coordination or strategic understanding among the players, leading to inefficient contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more dynamic contribution strategy. This could involve observing the average contribution of other players and adjusting your contribution to maintain a slightly lower or equal amount, aiming to minimize free-riding while still benefiting from the public good. Additionally, consider contributing more when others contribute significantly more, as this could indicate a round with a higher potential payout. By adapting to the behavior of other players, you may be able to optimize your token retention and overall gain over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (you) has been contributing a consistent amount of tokens (mainly 4 or 5) to the public pot in each round. However, the total tokens contributed by all players vary, and your individual gain from the public good payoff seems to be fluctuating. The failure here lies in the lack of a dynamic strategy that adapts to the contributions of other players. To mitigate this, a new plan could be to adopt a conditional contribution strategy: contribute more tokens when others contribute more, and less when they contribute less. This way, you can potentially maximize your share of the public good while minimizing personal losses when others contribute less. Additionally, consider the potential for free-riding behavior in others and adjust your contributions accordingly to avoid being exploited.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot, sometimes contributing less than other players. This inconsistency could be due to a lack of strategy or an attempt to conserve tokens. To mitigate this failure, a new plan is needed. \n\nA high-level plan to improve performance would be to adopt a more strategic approach based on the average contribution of other players. Player_4 should aim to contribute just enough tokens to ensure the public pot is maximized without over-contributing. If the average contribution of other players is 4 tokens, player_4 should also contribute 4 tokens to maintain the equilibrium. This way, player_4 can balance the benefit from the public good with retaining tokens for future rounds. Additionally, if player_4 notices a trend of other players reducing their contributions, they should consider doing the same to avoid exploitation.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (you) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes individual gain. There seems to be a lack of coordination with other players, as contributions are not consistently aligned with the highest payoffs. A possible reason for this is that you might not be effectively predicting or adapting to the contribution patterns of the other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach based on the observed behavior of other players. This could involve:\n\n1. **Observation and pattern recognition**: Analyze the contribution patterns of other players to identify if they tend to contribute more or less when you contribute more.\n2. **Conditional contribution**: If others tend to contribute more when you do, consider increasing your contribution. If they contribute less, decrease your contribution to avoid exploitation.\n3. **Risk assessment**: Weigh the potential gain from contributing against the risk of others not contributing proportionally, and adjust your contribution accordingly.\n4. **Adaptation**: Continuously update your strategy based on the evolving game dynamics and the changing behavior of other players.\n5. **Optimal contribution level**: Determine an optimal contribution level that balances the trade-off between personal gain and the public good, considering the multiplier factor of 2.\n\nBy implementing this plan, you aim to better align your contributions with the potential for maximizing individual payoff while taking into account the actions of the other players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's contribution strategy has been relatively inconsistent, ranging from 3 to 6 tokens per round. This inconsistency might be causing player_4 to miss out on potential gains when other players contribute more tokens, leading to a lower average payoff. To mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. A high-level plan could be to monitor the average contribution of other players and contribute slightly less than that amount to benefit from the public good while minimizing personal loss. This way, player_4 can balance the risk of over-contributing with the potential for higher gains when others contribute more. Additionally, if the trend of other players' contributions decreases, player_4 should also adjust downward to conserve tokens.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's token contributions are not consistently aligned with the potential for maximizing their gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. For example, in Round 10, contributing 5 tokens instead of 4 would have led to a slightly higher gain. Additionally, in rounds with lower total contributions, like Round 14, contributing fewer tokens might have been more beneficial to avoid a lower payoff per token contributed.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic approach to their contributions. A high-level plan could be to:\n\n1. Assess the average contribution of other players in previous rounds and adjust contributions to slightly exceed this average, as this tends to result in a higher multiplier on the public pot.\n2. In rounds with low total contributions from others, consider contributing fewer tokens to minimize potential losses if the public pot multiplier is low.\n3. Monitor the tokens of other players to identify patterns or changes in their behavior and adapt contributions accordingly.\n4. Maintain a balance between contributing to the public good and preserving tokens for personal gain, especially when nearing the end of the game to maximize the final token count.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4's token contributions are not consistently optimized for maximizing their gains. There seems to be a lack of coordination with other players, as contributions vary round to round, leading to inconsistent payoffs. To mitigate this failure, Player 4 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing tokens to match the average contribution of other players or using a Tit-for-Tat strategy where they match the previous round's contribution of the player with the highest contribution. This way, Player 4 can potentially align with the cooperative behavior of others and increase their overall gain.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4's strategy has been somewhat inconsistent, contributing anywhere from 2 to 6 tokens in different rounds. This inconsistency might be causing Player 4 to miss out on potential gains when other players contribute more tokens to the public pot. A possible reason for this behavior could be a lack of anticipation or adaptation to the contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 4 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens based on the average contribution of the previous round. This would allow for a more adaptive strategy that responds to the behavior of other players. For example, if the average contribution in the previous round is above a certain threshold, Player 4 could contribute slightly more to take advantage of the larger public pot, and conversely, contribute less when others contribute less. This way, Player 4 can better align their contributions with the potential payoffs and minimize losses due to inconsistent decision-making.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where player_4 contributes more tokens to the public pot when the average contribution from other players is lower, leading to a lower individual return on investment. For example, in Round 15, player_4 contributed 5 tokens when the average contribution was low, resulting in a smaller than average gain.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_4 could be to adopt a more conditional contribution strategy. This would involve observing the average contribution of other players in previous rounds and adjusting player_4's contribution to match or slightly exceed that average. This way, player_4 can ensure a more balanced participation in the public good while minimizing personal losses when others contribute less. Additionally, player_4 should consider contributing more when there's an indication that other players might be contributing significantly more, as this could lead to a higher multiplied public good and a potentially larger payout.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for the failure or suboptimal performance is that Player 4 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their long-term gain. There seems to be a lack of strategic coordination with other players, as contributions are not consistently aligned with the highest paying rounds. Additionally, there are instances where Player 4 contributes significantly more tokens than others, leading to a lower individual gain due to the even division of the public good payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for Player 4 would be to adopt a more consistent contribution strategy, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens in each round. This would help balance risk and reward, and potentially align better with the average contribution of other players. Additionally, Player 4 should consider monitoring the contribution patterns of other players and adjust their own contributions accordingly, aiming to contribute slightly less than the average to avoid over-contributing in rounds where others are not contributing as much. This way, Player 4 can optimize their gains while minimizing the risk of exploitation.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's strategy is inconsistent, contributing varying amounts of tokens without a clear pattern. This inconsistency could lead to suboptimal gains, as seen in Round 21 when player_4 contributed 10 tokens to the pot, resulting in a low individual payoff. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan should be adopted. Player_4 should aim to contribute tokens to the pot in a way that balances personal gain with the potential public good. A potential strategy could be to contribute slightly less than the average contribution of other players to benefit from their contributions while minimizing personal risk. This can be dynamically adjusted based on the observed contributions of other players in each round.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's strategy is inconsistent, contributing varying amounts of tokens without a clear pattern. This inconsistency could lead to suboptimal gains, as seen in Round 21 when player_4 contributed 10 tokens, resulting in a low individual payoff. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan should be to adopt a more strategic and stable contribution level, such as contributing a fixed percentage of tokens or adjusting contributions based on the average contribution of other players. This way, player_4 can better predict their payoffs and minimize the risk of large losses while potentially benefiting from the public good.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with varying degrees of inconsistency. There seems to be no clear strategy in place, as contributions range from 2 to 10 tokens across the rounds. This inconsistent contribution pattern could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively balance the trade-off between personal gain and contributing to the public good.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose adopting a more consistent and strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my current tokens to the public pot in each round. For example, contributing 20% of my tokens would provide a balance between supporting the public good and retaining tokens for personal gain. This way, I can maintain a predictable strategy while adapting to changes in my token count, which may encourage cooperation from other players and lead to more favorable outcomes.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's strategy is inconsistent, contributing different amounts of tokens across rounds without a clear pattern. This inconsistency could lead to suboptimal gains, as seen in Round 21 when player_4 contributed 10 tokens, resulting in a low return due to the low total contribution from other players. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan should be adopted. Player_4 should adopt a more cooperative and predictable strategy, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens or mirroring the average contribution of other players. This would help balance risk and reward, ensuring better long-term gains. Additionally, player_4 should consider adjusting their contribution based on the total tokens in the previous round, contributing more when others contribute more, to capitalize on the public good multiplier.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's strategy is inconsistent, contributing different numbers of tokens each round without a clear pattern. This inconsistency could lead to suboptimal gains, as seen in rounds like 21 where a large contribution (10 tokens) resulted in a low return, and round 22 where a small contribution (2 tokens) led to a higher gain. To mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the contributions of other players and aiming for a balance between personal gain and contributing to the public good. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of tokens based on the average contribution of other players, ensuring that the player neither exploits nor gets exploited by the group. This adaptive strategy would allow for better anticipation of the public pot's size and resulting payoff.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 4 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that optimizes their long-term gain. There seems to be a lack of strategic coordination with other players, as contributions are not always aligned with the highest payoffs. To mitigate this failure, Player 4 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing tokens when the expected public good payoff is high (when others are also contributing) and conserving tokens when others contribute less. This can be achieved by observing the contribution patterns of other players and adjusting contributions accordingly to maximize the average payoff per token contributed. Additionally, Player 4 should consider the potential for free-riding behavior in the group and weigh the benefits of contributing to the public good against the risk of others not contributing equally.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's strategy has been inconsistent, contributing different amounts of tokens each round without a clear pattern. This inconsistency could lead to suboptimal gains, as the player is not effectively leveraging the public pot's multiplying factor. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan is to adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of tokens based on the average contribution of other players. This way, player_4 can maintain a balanced contribution level relative to the group, maximizing the benefit from the public good while minimizing personal loss. Additionally, monitoring the round results to identify trends in other players' contributions could further refine the strategy.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's strategy is inconsistent, contributing different numbers of tokens each round without a clear pattern. This inconsistency could lead to suboptimal gains, as the player is not effectively leveraging the public good multiplier. To mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering factors such as the average contribution of other players and the potential impact on the public pot. A possible high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of tokens, slightly above the average contribution of other players, to benefit from the multiplied public good while minimizing personal loss. This strategy would ensure a more consistent and potentially more rewarding outcome over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 4 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that optimizes their long-term gain. There are instances where Player 4 contributes significantly more tokens than others (e.g., Round 21 with 10 tokens), resulting in a low individual payoff due to the low total contribution from other players. In contrast, there are rounds where Player 4 contributes less and could potentially gain more by contributing slightly more to take advantage of the higher total contributions from others.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 4 should adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. A high-level plan could be to monitor the average contribution of other players and adjust their own contribution to be slightly below or equal to this average. This strategy aims to balance the benefit from the public good while minimizing personal loss. Additionally, in rounds where the total contribution is expected to be low, Player 4 should consider contributing less to avoid over-contributing and receiving a lower payoff.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for the player's (player_4) suboptimal performance is a lack of consistency in contribution strategy. The player tends to contribute varying amounts without a clear pattern, which might lead to missed opportunities for higher payoffs when other players contribute more. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of tokens (e.g., 50%) to the public pot in each round. This would ensure a balanced contribution regardless of the round dynamics, maximizing the benefit from the public good while retaining a stable private collection. Additionally, monitoring the average contribution of other players and adjusting the contribution accordingly could also lead to better outcomes.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's token contributions are not consistently aligned with the potential for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier, but player_4 chose to contribute less. For example, in Round 21, contributing 10 tokens led to a low gain of 0.4, while in Round 22, contributing only 2 tokens resulted in a much higher gain of 6.0.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic approach to contribution based on the expected contributions of other players. A potential high-level plan is to estimate the average contribution of the other players and contribute just enough to ensure the total pot multiplied by 2 exceeds the average contribution per player, thus ensuring a positive net gain. Additionally, player_4 should be cautious of rounds with low total contributions, as they might offer an opportunity to contribute more and benefit from the higher multiplier. This strategy requires adaptability and observation of the behavior of other players to make informed decisions.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for the player's failure to consistently maximize gains is the lack of a clear strategy in adjusting contributions to the public pot. The player seems to be contributing tokens randomly, without considering the contributions of other players or the potential impact on the public good payoff. This results in missed opportunities to benefit from rounds where others contribute more and instances where the player's contribution might have been more or less beneficial.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a conditional contribution strategy. This would involve observing the average contribution of other players in previous rounds and adjusting the player's contribution to be slightly below or equal to that average. This way, the player can benefit from the public good without over-contributing and potentially losing tokens when others contribute less. Additionally, the player should consider contributing more when the public pot can result in a higher multiplier (when the sum of contributions is closer to the total tokens available), to maximize the potential gain from the multiplied payoff.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for suboptimal performance is that Player 4 is not consistently contributing the optimal number of tokens to maximize their gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the higher public pot multiplication. For example, in Round 11, contributing 5 tokens instead of 4 would have led to a higher gain, as the pot was multiplied by 21.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 4 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the contributions of other players and adjusting their own contribution accordingly. A high-level plan could be to estimate the average contribution of other players and contribute just enough tokens to reach a threshold close to the total contribution, ensuring the public pot multiplier is maximized without over-contributing. Additionally, Player 4 should be prepared to adjust this strategy if other players' behavior changes, particularly if they notice a pattern of free-riding or cooperation.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly. For example, in Round 34, contributing 5 tokens instead of 3 would have led to a higher gain due to the higher total in the pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_4 could be to adopt a more adaptive strategy. This could involve monitoring the average contribution of other players and adjusting own contributions to match or slightly exceed that average, ensuring a fair share of the public good while also taking into account the potential multiplication factor. Additionally, in rounds where other players contribute significantly more, player_4 should also be willing to contribute more to capitalize on the larger pot. This balance between cooperation and self-interest should lead to improved long-term gains.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4's strategy is somewhat inconsistent, contributing anywhere from 2 to 10 tokens in different rounds. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively balance the tradeoff between contributing to the public good and retaining tokens for personal gain. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan would be to adopt a more consistent and strategic contribution level, such as always contributing a fixed percentage of one's tokens, say 30%, to the public pot. This way, the player can maintain a balance between supporting the group effort and preserving their own resources over the long run. Additionally, observing the contributions of other players and adjusting slightly based on their behavior (e.g., contributing slightly more when others contribute less) could also improve the overall outcome.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_4's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly. For example, in Round 14, contributing 2 tokens when others contributed 4 or more led to a lower gain compared to the previous round where a similar contribution was made but with higher total tokens in the pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A high-level plan could be to contribute a number of tokens that is proportional to the average contribution of the other players, ensuring a fairer share of the public good payoff. Additionally, when the total contribution from others is high, player_4 should be more inclined to contribute more tokens to capitalize on the larger multiplier. This way, player_4 can balance the risk of losing tokens with the potential for a higher payoff.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, player_4 seems to be contributing tokens to the public pot inconsistently, with a tendency to contribute less when other players contribute more. This strategy might lead to lower gains in rounds where the total contribution is high, as the public good payoff is divided equally among all players. To mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens or mirroring the average contribution of other players. This way, player_4 can potentially benefit more from the public good when others also contribute significantly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_4's strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where player_4 contributes more tokens to the public pot than others, but does not receive a proportionally higher share due to the even division of the public good payoff. This is particularly evident when player_4 contributes 5 tokens while others contribute less, resulting in a lower net gain.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more cooperative but selfish strategy. The new plan is to contribute just enough tokens to match the average contribution of the other players, ensuring a fair share of the public good without over-contributing. This way, player_4 can maintain a balance between contributing to the group's benefit and avoiding exploitation by other players who might contribute less. Additionally, if the average contribution decreases, player_4 should also contribute less to minimize losses, and if the average increases, player_4 should consider increasing contribution to potentially gain more from the multiplied pot.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, player_4 seems to be contributing tokens to the public pot with a varying strategy, but not consistently in a way that maximizes their gains. There are instances where player_4 contributes more tokens when other players contribute less, leading to lower individual payoffs. This could be due to a lack of coordination or information about other players' contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_4 would be to adopt a more cooperative and strategic approach. This could involve contributing tokens to the pot in a way that aligns with the average contribution of the other players, ensuring a more balanced pot size and maximizing the public good payoff. Additionally, player_4 could consider using a Tit-for-Tat strategy, where they match the contribution of the previous round's highest contributor, assuming that others might also adopt similar cooperative behavior. This should lead to more stable and potentially higher gains over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's token contributions are not consistently aligned with the potential for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier, but player_4 chose to contribute less. For example, in Round 19, contributing 5 tokens instead of 10 led to a significantly lower gain. Similarly, in Round 21, contributing more than 2 tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the potential return on investment for each contribution. A high-level plan could be to calculate the average contribution of the other players and aim to contribute just enough to push the total tokens in the pot close to a threshold where the 2x multiplier provides a significantly higher payoff. This way, player_4 can balance the risk of losing tokens with the potential for a larger share of the public good. Additionally, monitoring the token counts of other players may help identify rounds where contributing more could exploit the potential for a higher collective contribution, maximizing the public good payoff.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly. For example, in Round 21, contributing only 2 tokens while other players contributed more led to a lower gain. To mitigate this failure, Player 4 should adopt a more adaptive strategy, observing the average contribution of other players and adjusting their own contribution to be closer to that average, ensuring a fairer share of the public good payoff without excessively depleting their private tokens. This approach should balance risk and reward more effectively and lead to better overall performance.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4's strategy is somewhat inconsistent, contributing anywhere from 2 to 10 tokens across different rounds. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively balance the tradeoff between personal gain and contributing to the public good. To mitigate this failure, Player 4 should adopt a more consistent and strategic approach. A possible high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of their tokens, say 30%, to the public pot in each round. This would ensure a balanced contribution while still benefiting from the multiplier effect of the public good. Additionally, observing the contributions of other players and adjusting the contribution based on their behavior (e.g., if others are freeriding, contributing less) could also be beneficial.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's token contributions are not consistently aligned with the optimal strategy for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, especially when other players contribute more tokens. The failure seems to stem from not effectively anticipating and adapting to the contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_4 could be to adopt a more strategic approach based on the observed behavior of other players. This could involve tracking the average contribution of other players and adjusting own contributions to match or slightly exceed that average when the total contribution is likely to result in a higher multiplier for the public pot. Additionally, player_4 should consider contributing more tokens when the public pot is likely to be larger due to higher contributions from others, and hold back when others contribute very little to avoid potential free-ridership. This dynamic and adaptive strategy should lead to more optimal token allocation and increased gains over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 4's token contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, ranging from contributing as low as 2 tokens to as high as 10 tokens. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't seem to effectively balance personal gain with contributing to the public good. To mitigate this failure, Player 4 should adopt a more consistent and strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens or using a threshold-based strategy where they contribute more when others' contributions are high, ensuring a more balanced and potentially more rewarding participation in the game.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes personal gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. However, there are also rounds where contributing fewer tokens would have been more beneficial, especially when other players contribute less, reducing the overall pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. I should consider the contributions of other players and adjust my own contribution accordingly. If others are contributing significantly, I should contribute more to take advantage of the larger pot. Conversely, if others are contributing less, I should contribute less to conserve tokens. Additionally, I should aim to balance my contributions to avoid depleting my private tokens too quickly while still benefiting from the public good. This adaptive strategy should lead to better long-term gains.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute more tokens. For example, in Round 21, contributing 10 tokens led to a low gain of 0.4, while in Round 22, contributing only 2 tokens resulted in a much higher gain of 6.0.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A potential high-level plan is to contribute tokens in a way that matches the average contribution of the other players, ensuring a fair share of the public good without over-contributing when others do not. Additionally, player_4 should avoid contributing significantly more tokens than the average, as this often results in a lower individual payoff due to the even division of the public good. By adjusting contributions based on the observed behavior of other players, player_4 can optimize their long-term token accumulation.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4's strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute more tokens. For example, in Round 21, contributing fewer tokens led to a lower gain compared to the average contribution of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 4 should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A high-level plan could be to contribute tokens equal to or slightly above the average contribution of other players in order to benefit from the larger public good multiplier while ensuring a fair share of the payoff. Additionally, in rounds where other players contribute significantly less, Player 4 should consider conserving tokens to avoid subsidizing the public good without receiving proportionate benefits. This balanced approach should lead to more consistent gains over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's contribution strategy is not consistently aligned with the potential for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute more tokens.

The new plan is to monitor the average contribution of the other players and adjust contributions accordingly. If the average contribution is high, player_4 should contribute more to take advantage of the larger public good payoff. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_4 should contribute less to conserve tokens. This way, player_4 can balance the risk of contributing to a potentially small public good with the potential for a larger payoff when others also contribute significantly.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's token contributions are not consistently aligned with the potential for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier, but player_4 chose to contribute less. For example, in Round 21, contributing 10 tokens led to a low gain of 0.4, while in Round 22, contributing only 2 tokens resulted in a much higher gain of 6.0.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the contributions of other players and the potential for a higher multiplier effect. If the majority of other players are contributing more tokens, it might be beneficial for player_4 to do the same in order to capitalize on the larger public pot. Conversely, if other players are contributing fewer tokens, it might be wiser to contribute less to avoid potential free-ridership. By dynamically adjusting contributions based on the actions of others and the potential for a larger payout, player_4 can optimize their long-term token accumulation.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (you) has been contributing an inconsistent number of tokens to the public pot, with a tendency to contribute less than the average contribution of other players. This strategy seems to have resulted in a fluctuating token balance, sometimes gaining less than the potential payoff. To improve, a more strategic approach would be to contribute an amount close to the average contribution of other players, ensuring a fair share of the public good payoff while avoiding over-contributing and depleting your private tokens unnecessarily. This can be achieved by observing the average contribution in previous rounds and adjusting your contribution accordingly.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good dynamics. In some rounds, player_4 contributes more tokens when others contribute less, leading to a lower individual gain (e.g., Round 21), while in other rounds, contributing less when others contribute more results in a higher gain (e.g., Round 22).\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to adopt a conditional contribution strategy, where they contribute more tokens when the average contribution of other players is high, and less when it's low. This can be achieved by estimating the average contribution in the previous few rounds and adjusting the contribution accordingly to maximize the benefit from the public good. Additionally, player_4 should consider a threshold for the minimum return on investment, contributing only when the expected gain is likely to surpass the cost of the contribution.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's contribution strategy is inconsistent, often contributing less than the average number of tokens contributed by other players. This may result in lower gains compared to more cooperative players, as the public good payoff is multiplied by the total tokens in the pot and then evenly divided. To mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing the average amount contributed by other players in the previous round, or contributing slightly more to encourage others to contribute as well. This way, player_4 can potentially benefit from a larger public pot while maintaining a balanced contribution level.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 4 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their gains. There seems to be a lack of strategic coordination with other players, as contributions are not always aligned with the highest paying rounds. To mitigate this failure, Player 4 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing more tokens when others are also contributing significantly, to capitalize on the higher multiplier. Additionally, they should consider contributing less when others contribute very little, to avoid free-riding by other players. This way, Player 4 can better balance their contributions with the expected public good payoff.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good dynamics.

Player_4 should aim to contribute tokens in a way that maximizes the expected return, considering the contributions of other players. If others are contributing more, player_4 should contribute less to avoid free-riding. If others contribute less, player_4 should contribute more to potentially benefit from a higher multiplier on the public pot. This can be achieved by monitoring the average contributions of other players and adjusting contributions accordingly, while also factoring in the current token balance to minimize risk.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a result of not effectively anticipating the collective contributions of other players or not optimizing for the long-term average gain. To mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens based on the average contribution of previous rounds, ensuring a balance between personal gain and contribution to the public good. This way, player_4 can adapt to the dynamics of the game while maximizing their overall tokens over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 4 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their long-term gain.

This way, Player 4 can balance their contributions to optimize their individual payoff while taking into account the behavior of other players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's strategy is to contribute an average of 3 tokens per round, with occasional higher contributions. This strategy seems to result in a mixed outcome, with gains ranging from 1.2 to 5.4 tokens per round. The failure lies in not adapting the contribution to the actions of other players, which could lead to missed opportunities for higher gains when others contribute more, and potentially over-contributing when others contribute less.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_4 would be to adopt a more dynamic strategy. This could involve observing the average contribution of other players and adjusting contributions accordingly. If the average contribution of others is high, player_4 should consider contributing more to maximize the public good payoff. Conversely, if others contribute less, player_4 should contribute less to conserve tokens. Additionally, player_4 should consider the potential for free-riding when others contribute significantly more, and weigh the benefits of contributing against the risk of diluting the reward. This adaptive approach should lead to more consistent gains and better overall performance.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a result of not effectively anticipating the collective contributions of other players or not optimizing for the long-term average gain. To mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens based on the average contribution of previous rounds, or using a Tit-for-Tat strategy where they match the previous round's contribution of the most successful player. This would help to better align contributions with potential payoffs and stabilize token accumulation over time.\n\n```"

      "learnings": "Reflections:\n-Upon reviewing the historical data from Round 1, a possible reason for failure or suboptimal performance is that some players, including myself as player_4, contributed more tokens than others without receiving a proportionally higher benefit. In this case, I contributed 8 tokens, which was the highest among all players, but the public good payoff was evenly divided among all players, resulting in a lower individual gain compared to those who contributed fewer tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, a new high-level plan would be to adopt a more strategic and cooperative approach. This could involve observing the contribution patterns of other players and adjusting my contribution based on their behavior. If others tend to contribute less, I should consider contributing less as well to avoid over-contributing and receiving a lower per-token return. Additionally, I should aim for a balance between contributing to the public good and retaining tokens for personal gain, especially if I notice a consistent free-rider pattern among other players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that players are contributing varying amounts of tokens to the public pot. In Round 1, you contributed more tokens (8) than the average contribution, which led to a lower individual gain compared to the other players who contributed less. In Round 2, you contributed less (5) and received a higher gain. This suggests that contributing fewer tokens than the average can be a more beneficial strategy when others are contributing more.\n\nTo mitigate the potential failure of over-contributing and receiving a lower share of the public good, a new high-level plan is to adopt a conditional contribution strategy. This strategy involves observing the average contribution of other players in each round and contributing slightly less than that average. By doing so, you can benefit from the public good while minimizing the risk of over-contributing. Additionally, you should adapt this strategy based on the changing behavior of other players to ensure continued advantage.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that the players, including myself as player_4, are contributing varying amounts of tokens to the public pot. In Round 1, I contributed the most tokens, but in Rounds 2 and 3, my contribution was lower, and more in line with the other players. The public pot's total tokens also decreased in subsequent rounds, suggesting that players might be adjusting their contributions based on previous outcomes.\n\nA possible reason for failure or suboptimal performance is that players are not consistently contributing their tokens in a way that maximizes the public good payoff. This could be due to a lack of coordination or an attempt to exploit others' contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan is to adopt a more strategic and cooperative approach. I should aim to contribute a consistent amount of tokens, close to the average contribution of the other players, to encourage stability in the public pot. Additionally, I should monitor the changes in other players' contributions and adjust my strategy accordingly, while also factoring in the potential for others to do the same. This way, I can strive for a balance between maximizing the public good and protecting my own tokens.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my contribution strategy has been relatively consistent, contributing 5 tokens in three out of four rounds and 8 tokens in the first round. While this strategy has resulted in gains, it seems that my contributions are not always aligned with the highest or lowest contributions from other players, which could lead to suboptimal outcomes. In some cases, contributing more when others contribute less could lead to a higher public pot multiplier, potentially increasing my share of the payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose a new high-level plan: adapt my contribution based on the average contribution of the other players. If the average contribution is low, I should contribute more to take advantage of the higher multiplier. If the average contribution is high, I should contribute less to minimize my personal loss while still benefiting from the public good. This way, I can dynamically adjust my strategy to better align with the behavior of other players and potentially maximize my gains.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (myself) has been contributing a consistent amount of tokens (5 or 6) to the public pot in each round. However, the contributions of the other players have varied, sometimes significantly. This suggests that a fixed contribution strategy might not be optimal, as it doesn't adapt to the varying contributions of others. A possible reason for failure is the lack of adaptability and the inability to exploit the potential benefits when other players contribute more.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose a new high-level plan: adopt a dynamic contribution strategy that takes into account the average contribution of the other players in each round. If the average contribution is high, I should contribute more to maximize the public good payoff. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, I should contribute less to conserve my tokens. This way, I can better align my actions with the potential benefits and adapt to the changing behavior of other players.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (you) has been consistently contributing 5 tokens in the last three rounds, while the contributions of other players have varied. This static strategy might lead to suboptimal outcomes because it doesn't adapt to the changing contributions of other players. A possible reason for this could be a lack of dynamic decision-making based on the observed behavior of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan is to adopt a more adaptive strategy. This could involve contributing a number of tokens that aligns with the average contribution of the other players in each round. By doing so, you can potentially maximize your gain when others contribute more and minimize losses when they contribute less. Additionally, consider contributing slightly more when the total contribution is close to a multiple of 5, as the public good multiplier (2) would lead to a higher payoff for all players. This way, you can balance between cooperation and personal gain more effectively.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (myself) has been contributing a relatively consistent amount of tokens to the public pot, usually around 5 or 6 tokens. However, there seems to be a lack of strategic adaptation to the varying contributions of other players. In some rounds, contributing the same amount as others could lead to a more equal division of the public good payoff, while in other rounds, contributing more or less might be beneficial.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A potential high-level plan is to calculate the average contribution of the other players and adjust my contribution to be slightly above or below that average, depending on whether the total contribution is closer to a threshold that would result in a higher or lower multiplier for the public good. This way, I can potentially exploit the contributions of more cooperative or selfish players while minimizing the risk of over-contributing. Additionally, I should consider the long-term implications of my actions, as other players may also adapt their strategies, and aim for a balance between cooperation and self-interest.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (myself) has been contributing a relatively consistent number of tokens to the public pot, usually around 5 or 6. However, there seems to be a lack of strategic adaptation to the varying contributions of other players. This rigidity in contribution might lead to suboptimal outcomes, as I'm not maximizing the potential gain from the public good when others contribute more tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A high-level plan would be to contribute a percentage of my tokens that is proportional to the average contribution of all players in a given round. This way, I can ensure that my investment aligns with the potential return from the public good, maximizing my gain while minimizing the risk of exploitation. Additionally, I should consider contributing slightly more when others contribute less to encourage higher collective contributions, as the public good multiplier (2) makes it beneficial for all when the pot is larger.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (you) has been consistently contributing around 5 tokens per round, with a few instances of contributing 4 or 6 tokens. This strategy seems to result in an average gain of around 5 to 6 tokens per round. However, there is a potential issue with adaptability to other players' contributions. For example, in Round 2, when other players contributed more tokens, you could have potentially gained more by contributing more as well. \n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more dynamic strategy. This would involve observing the average contribution of other players in the previous round and adjusting your contribution to be slightly below that average. This way, you can benefit from the higher public pot without over-contributing and risking a lower individual gain. Additionally, if the average contribution decreases, you can maintain or slightly increase your contribution to potentially exploit the lower overall contribution from others. This adaptive approach should help optimize gains while minimizing the risk of over-contributing.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (you) has been consistently contributing around 5 tokens per round, with a few instances of contributing 4 or 6 tokens. This strategy seems to result in an average gain of around 5 to 6 tokens per round. However, there is a potential issue with adaptability to other players' contributions. For example, in Round 2, when other players contributed more tokens, you could have potentially gained more by contributing more as well. \n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more dynamic strategy. This would involve observing the average contribution of other players in the previous round and adjusting your contribution to be slightly below that average. This way, you can benefit from the higher public pot while minimizing the risk of over-contributing when others do not. Additionally, consider contributing slightly more when the total contribution in the previous round was particularly high, as this could indicate a potential for a larger public good payoff.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4 is contributing tokens to the public pot consistently, but not always optimally. There seems to be a lack of adaptability in response to the varying contributions of other players. For instance, in rounds where other players contribute more tokens, player_4 could potentially gain more by contributing slightly more as well. To mitigate this failure, a new plan could involve using a more dynamic strategy: player_4 should observe the average contribution of the other players and aim to contribute slightly above that average to benefit from the higher multiplier without over-contributing. This way, player_4 can better align with the overall group effort and potentially increase their gains.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (you) has been contributing a relatively consistent amount of tokens to the public pot, usually around 4 or 5 tokens per round. However, the total tokens in the pot have varied significantly, and your gains have not consistently increased. This suggests that there might be a lack of coordination or strategic understanding among the players, leading to inefficient contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more dynamic contribution strategy. This could involve observing the average contribution of other players and adjusting your contribution to maintain a slightly lower or equal amount, aiming to minimize free-riding while still benefiting from the public good. Additionally, consider contributing more when others contribute significantly more, as this could indicate a round with a higher potential payout. By adapting to the behavior of other players, you may be able to optimize your token retention and overall gain over time.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (you) has been contributing a consistent amount of tokens (mainly 4 or 5) to the public pot in each round. However, the total tokens contributed by all players vary, and your individual gain from the public good payoff seems to be fluctuating. The failure here lies in the lack of a dynamic strategy that adapts to the contributions of other players. To mitigate this, a new plan could be to adopt a conditional contribution strategy: contribute more tokens when others contribute more, and less when they contribute less. This way, you can potentially maximize your share of the public good while minimizing personal losses when others contribute less. Additionally, consider the potential for free-riding behavior in others and adjust your contributions accordingly to avoid being exploited.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot, sometimes contributing less than other players. This inconsistency could be due to a lack of strategy or an attempt to conserve tokens. To mitigate this failure, a new plan is needed. \n\nA high-level plan to improve performance would be to adopt a more strategic approach based on the average contribution of other players. Player_4 should aim to contribute just enough tokens to ensure the public pot is maximized without over-contributing. If the average contribution of other players is 4 tokens, player_4 should also contribute 4 tokens to maintain the equilibrium. This way, player_4 can balance the benefit from the public good with retaining tokens for future rounds. Additionally, if player_4 notices a trend of other players reducing their contributions, they should consider doing the same to avoid exploitation.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (you) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes individual gain. There seems to be a lack of coordination with other players, as contributions are not consistently aligned with the highest payoffs. A possible reason for this is that you might not be effectively predicting or adapting to the contribution patterns of the other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach based on the observed behavior of other players. This could involve:\n\n1. **Observation and pattern recognition**: Analyze the contribution patterns of other players to identify if they tend to contribute more or less when you contribute more.\n2. **Conditional contribution**: If others tend to contribute more when you do, consider increasing your contribution. If they contribute less, decrease your contribution to avoid exploitation.\n3. **Risk assessment**: Weigh the potential gain from contributing against the risk of others not contributing proportionally, and adjust your contribution accordingly.\n4. **Adaptation**: Continuously update your strategy based on the evolving game dynamics and the changing behavior of other players.\n5. **Optimal contribution level**: Determine an optimal contribution level that balances the trade-off between personal gain and the public good, considering the multiplier factor of 2.\n\nBy implementing this plan, you aim to better align your contributions with the potential for maximizing individual payoff while taking into account the actions of the other players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's contribution strategy has been relatively inconsistent, ranging from 3 to 6 tokens per round. This inconsistency might be causing player_4 to miss out on potential gains when other players contribute more tokens, leading to a lower average payoff. To mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. A high-level plan could be to monitor the average contribution of other players and contribute slightly less than that amount to benefit from the public good while minimizing personal loss. This way, player_4 can balance the risk of over-contributing with the potential for higher gains when others contribute more. Additionally, if the trend of other players' contributions decreases, player_4 should also adjust downward to conserve tokens.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's token contributions are not consistently aligned with the potential for maximizing their gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. For example, in Round 10, contributing 5 tokens instead of 4 would have led to a slightly higher gain. Additionally, in rounds with lower total contributions, like Round 14, contributing fewer tokens might have been more beneficial to avoid a lower payoff per token contributed.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic approach to their contributions. A high-level plan could be to:\n\n1. Assess the average contribution of other players in previous rounds and adjust contributions to slightly exceed this average, as this tends to result in a higher multiplier on the public pot.\n2. In rounds with low total contributions from others, consider contributing fewer tokens to minimize potential losses if the public pot multiplier is low.\n3. Monitor the tokens of other players to identify patterns or changes in their behavior and adapt contributions accordingly.\n4. Maintain a balance between contributing to the public good and preserving tokens for personal gain, especially when nearing the end of the game to maximize the final token count.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4's token contributions are not consistently optimized for maximizing their gains. There seems to be a lack of coordination with other players, as contributions vary round to round, leading to inconsistent payoffs. To mitigate this failure, Player 4 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing tokens to match the average contribution of other players or using a Tit-for-Tat strategy where they match the previous round's contribution of the player with the highest contribution. This way, Player 4 can potentially align with the cooperative behavior of others and increase their overall gain.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4's strategy has been somewhat inconsistent, contributing anywhere from 2 to 6 tokens in different rounds. This inconsistency might be causing Player 4 to miss out on potential gains when other players contribute more tokens to the public pot. A possible reason for this behavior could be a lack of anticipation or adaptation to the contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 4 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens based on the average contribution of the previous round. This would allow for a more adaptive strategy that responds to the behavior of other players. For example, if the average contribution in the previous round is above a certain threshold, Player 4 could contribute slightly more to take advantage of the larger public pot, and conversely, contribute less when others contribute less. This way, Player 4 can better align their contributions with the potential payoffs and minimize losses due to inconsistent decision-making.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where player_4 contributes more tokens to the public pot when the average contribution from other players is lower, leading to a lower individual return on investment. For example, in Round 15, player_4 contributed 5 tokens when the average contribution was low, resulting in a smaller than average gain.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_4 could be to adopt a more conditional contribution strategy. This would involve observing the average contribution of other players in previous rounds and adjusting player_4's contribution to match or slightly exceed that average. This way, player_4 can ensure a more balanced participation in the public good while minimizing personal losses when others contribute less. Additionally, player_4 should consider contributing more when there's an indication that other players might be contributing significantly more, as this could lead to a higher multiplied public good and a potentially larger payout.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for the failure or suboptimal performance is that Player 4 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their long-term gain. There seems to be a lack of strategic coordination with other players, as contributions are not consistently aligned with the highest paying rounds. Additionally, there are instances where Player 4 contributes significantly more tokens than others, leading to a lower individual gain due to the even division of the public good payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for Player 4 would be to adopt a more consistent contribution strategy, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens in each round. This would help balance risk and reward, and potentially align better with the average contribution of other players. Additionally, Player 4 should consider monitoring the contribution patterns of other players and adjust their own contributions accordingly, aiming to contribute slightly less than the average to avoid over-contributing in rounds where others are not contributing as much. This way, Player 4 can optimize their gains while minimizing the risk of exploitation.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's strategy is inconsistent, contributing varying amounts of tokens without a clear pattern. This inconsistency could lead to suboptimal gains, as seen in Round 21 when player_4 contributed 10 tokens to the pot, resulting in a low individual payoff. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan should be adopted. Player_4 should aim to contribute tokens to the pot in a way that balances personal gain with the potential public good. A potential strategy could be to contribute slightly less than the average contribution of other players to benefit from their contributions while minimizing personal risk. This can be dynamically adjusted based on the observed contributions of other players in each round.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's strategy is inconsistent, contributing varying amounts of tokens without a clear pattern. This inconsistency could lead to suboptimal gains, as seen in Round 21 when player_4 contributed 10 tokens, resulting in a low individual payoff. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan should be to adopt a more strategic and stable contribution level, such as contributing a fixed percentage of tokens or adjusting contributions based on the average contribution of other players. This way, player_4 can better predict their payoffs and minimize the risk of large losses while potentially benefiting from the public good.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with varying degrees of inconsistency. There seems to be no clear strategy in place, as contributions range from 2 to 10 tokens across the rounds. This inconsistent contribution pattern could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively balance the trade-off between personal gain and contributing to the public good.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I propose adopting a more consistent and strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of my current tokens to the public pot in each round. For example, contributing 20% of my tokens would provide a balance between supporting the public good and retaining tokens for personal gain. This way, I can maintain a predictable strategy while adapting to changes in my token count, which may encourage cooperation from other players and lead to more favorable outcomes.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's strategy is inconsistent, contributing different amounts of tokens across rounds without a clear pattern. This inconsistency could lead to suboptimal gains, as seen in Round 21 when player_4 contributed 10 tokens, resulting in a low return due to the low total contribution from other players. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan should be adopted. Player_4 should adopt a more cooperative and predictable strategy, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens or mirroring the average contribution of other players. This would help balance risk and reward, ensuring better long-term gains. Additionally, player_4 should consider adjusting their contribution based on the total tokens in the previous round, contributing more when others contribute more, to capitalize on the public good multiplier.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's strategy is inconsistent, contributing different numbers of tokens each round without a clear pattern. This inconsistency could lead to suboptimal gains, as seen in rounds like 21 where a large contribution (10 tokens) resulted in a low return, and round 22 where a small contribution (2 tokens) led to a higher gain. To mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the contributions of other players and aiming for a balance between personal gain and contributing to the public good. A potential high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of tokens based on the average contribution of other players, ensuring that the player neither exploits nor gets exploited by the group. This adaptive strategy would allow for better anticipation of the public pot's size and resulting payoff.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 4 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that optimizes their long-term gain. There seems to be a lack of strategic coordination with other players, as contributions are not always aligned with the highest payoffs. To mitigate this failure, Player 4 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing tokens when the expected public good payoff is high (when others are also contributing) and conserving tokens when others contribute less. This can be achieved by observing the contribution patterns of other players and adjusting contributions accordingly to maximize the average payoff per token contributed. Additionally, Player 4 should consider the potential for free-riding behavior in the group and weigh the benefits of contributing to the public good against the risk of others not contributing equally.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's strategy has been inconsistent, contributing different amounts of tokens each round without a clear pattern. This inconsistency could lead to suboptimal gains, as the player is not effectively leveraging the public pot's multiplying factor. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan is to adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of tokens based on the average contribution of other players. This way, player_4 can maintain a balanced contribution level relative to the group, maximizing the benefit from the public good while minimizing personal loss. Additionally, monitoring the round results to identify trends in other players' contributions could further refine the strategy.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's strategy is inconsistent, contributing different numbers of tokens each round without a clear pattern. This inconsistency could lead to suboptimal gains, as the player is not effectively leveraging the public good multiplier. To mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering factors such as the average contribution of other players and the potential impact on the public pot. A possible high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of tokens, slightly above the average contribution of other players, to benefit from the multiplied public good while minimizing personal loss. This strategy would ensure a more consistent and potentially more rewarding outcome over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 4 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that optimizes their long-term gain. There are instances where Player 4 contributes significantly more tokens than others (e.g., Round 21 with 10 tokens), resulting in a low individual payoff due to the low total contribution from other players. In contrast, there are rounds where Player 4 contributes less and could potentially gain more by contributing slightly more to take advantage of the higher total contributions from others.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 4 should adopt a more strategic and adaptive approach. A high-level plan could be to monitor the average contribution of other players and adjust their own contribution to be slightly below or equal to this average. This strategy aims to balance the benefit from the public good while minimizing personal loss. Additionally, in rounds where the total contribution is expected to be low, Player 4 should consider contributing less to avoid over-contributing and receiving a lower payoff.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for the player's (player_4) suboptimal performance is a lack of consistency in contribution strategy. The player tends to contribute varying amounts without a clear pattern, which might lead to missed opportunities for higher payoffs when other players contribute more. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of tokens (e.g., 50%) to the public pot in each round. This would ensure a balanced contribution regardless of the round dynamics, maximizing the benefit from the public good while retaining a stable private collection. Additionally, monitoring the average contribution of other players and adjusting the contribution accordingly could also lead to better outcomes.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's token contributions are not consistently aligned with the potential for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier, but player_4 chose to contribute less. For example, in Round 21, contributing 10 tokens led to a low gain of 0.4, while in Round 22, contributing only 2 tokens resulted in a much higher gain of 6.0.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic approach to contribution based on the expected contributions of other players. A potential high-level plan is to estimate the average contribution of the other players and contribute just enough to ensure the total pot multiplied by 2 exceeds the average contribution per player, thus ensuring a positive net gain. Additionally, player_4 should be cautious of rounds with low total contributions, as they might offer an opportunity to contribute more and benefit from the higher multiplier. This strategy requires adaptability and observation of the behavior of other players to make informed decisions.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for the player's failure to consistently maximize gains is the lack of a clear strategy in adjusting contributions to the public pot. The player seems to be contributing tokens randomly, without considering the contributions of other players or the potential impact on the public good payoff. This results in missed opportunities to benefit from rounds where others contribute more and instances where the player's contribution might have been more or less beneficial.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could be to adopt a conditional contribution strategy. This would involve observing the average contribution of other players in previous rounds and adjusting the player's contribution to be slightly below or equal to that average. This way, the player can benefit from the public good without over-contributing and potentially losing tokens when others contribute less. Additionally, the player should consider contributing more when the public pot can result in a higher multiplier (when the sum of contributions is closer to the total tokens available), to maximize the potential gain from the multiplied payoff.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, a possible reason for suboptimal performance is that Player 4 is not consistently contributing the optimal number of tokens to maximize their gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the higher public pot multiplication. For example, in Round 11, contributing 5 tokens instead of 4 would have led to a higher gain, as the pot was multiplied by 21.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 4 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the contributions of other players and adjusting their own contribution accordingly. A high-level plan could be to estimate the average contribution of other players and contribute just enough tokens to reach a threshold close to the total contribution, ensuring the public pot multiplier is maximized without over-contributing. Additionally, Player 4 should be prepared to adjust this strategy if other players' behavior changes, particularly if they notice a pattern of free-riding or cooperation.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly. For example, in Round 34, contributing 5 tokens instead of 3 would have led to a higher gain due to the higher total in the pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_4 could be to adopt a more adaptive strategy. This could involve monitoring the average contribution of other players and adjusting own contributions to match or slightly exceed that average, ensuring a fair share of the public good while also taking into account the potential multiplication factor. Additionally, in rounds where other players contribute significantly more, player_4 should also be willing to contribute more to capitalize on the larger pot. This balance between cooperation and self-interest should lead to improved long-term gains.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4's strategy is somewhat inconsistent, contributing anywhere from 2 to 10 tokens in different rounds. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively balance the tradeoff between contributing to the public good and retaining tokens for personal gain. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan would be to adopt a more consistent and strategic contribution level, such as always contributing a fixed percentage of one's tokens, say 30%, to the public pot. This way, the player can maintain a balance between supporting the group effort and preserving their own resources over the long run. Additionally, observing the contributions of other players and adjusting slightly based on their behavior (e.g., contributing slightly more when others contribute less) could also improve the overall outcome.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_4's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly. For example, in Round 14, contributing 2 tokens when others contributed 4 or more led to a lower gain compared to the previous round where a similar contribution was made but with higher total tokens in the pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A high-level plan could be to contribute a number of tokens that is proportional to the average contribution of the other players, ensuring a fairer share of the public good payoff. Additionally, when the total contribution from others is high, player_4 should be more inclined to contribute more tokens to capitalize on the larger multiplier. This way, player_4 can balance the risk of losing tokens with the potential for a higher payoff.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, player_4 seems to be contributing tokens to the public pot inconsistently, with a tendency to contribute less when other players contribute more. This strategy might lead to lower gains in rounds where the total contribution is high, as the public good payoff is divided equally among all players. To mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens or mirroring the average contribution of other players. This way, player_4 can potentially benefit more from the public good when others also contribute significantly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that player_4's strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where player_4 contributes more tokens to the public pot than others, but does not receive a proportionally higher share due to the even division of the public good payoff. This is particularly evident when player_4 contributes 5 tokens while others contribute less, resulting in a lower net gain.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more cooperative but selfish strategy. The new plan is to contribute just enough tokens to match the average contribution of the other players, ensuring a fair share of the public good without over-contributing. This way, player_4 can maintain a balance between contributing to the group's benefit and avoiding exploitation by other players who might contribute less. Additionally, if the average contribution decreases, player_4 should also contribute less to minimize losses, and if the average increases, player_4 should consider increasing contribution to potentially gain more from the multiplied pot.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, player_4 seems to be contributing tokens to the public pot with a varying strategy, but not consistently in a way that maximizes their gains. There are instances where player_4 contributes more tokens when other players contribute less, leading to lower individual payoffs. This could be due to a lack of coordination or information about other players' contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_4 would be to adopt a more cooperative and strategic approach. This could involve contributing tokens to the pot in a way that aligns with the average contribution of the other players, ensuring a more balanced pot size and maximizing the public good payoff. Additionally, player_4 could consider using a Tit-for-Tat strategy, where they match the contribution of the previous round's highest contributor, assuming that others might also adopt similar cooperative behavior. This should lead to more stable and potentially higher gains over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's token contributions are not consistently aligned with the potential for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier, but player_4 chose to contribute less. For example, in Round 19, contributing 5 tokens instead of 10 led to a significantly lower gain. Similarly, in Round 21, contributing more than 2 tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the potential return on investment for each contribution. A high-level plan could be to calculate the average contribution of the other players and aim to contribute just enough to push the total tokens in the pot close to a threshold where the 2x multiplier provides a significantly higher payoff. This way, player_4 can balance the risk of losing tokens with the potential for a larger share of the public good. Additionally, monitoring the token counts of other players may help identify rounds where contributing more could exploit the potential for a higher collective contribution, maximizing the public good payoff.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute significantly. For example, in Round 21, contributing only 2 tokens while other players contributed more led to a lower gain. To mitigate this failure, Player 4 should adopt a more adaptive strategy, observing the average contribution of other players and adjusting their own contribution to be closer to that average, ensuring a fairer share of the public good payoff without excessively depleting their private tokens. This approach should balance risk and reward more effectively and lead to better overall performance.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4's strategy is somewhat inconsistent, contributing anywhere from 2 to 10 tokens across different rounds. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively balance the tradeoff between personal gain and contributing to the public good. To mitigate this failure, Player 4 should adopt a more consistent and strategic approach. A possible high-level plan is to contribute a fixed percentage of their tokens, say 30%, to the public pot in each round. This would ensure a balanced contribution while still benefiting from the multiplier effect of the public good. Additionally, observing the contributions of other players and adjusting the contribution based on their behavior (e.g., if others are freeriding, contributing less) could also be beneficial.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's token contributions are not consistently aligned with the optimal strategy for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff, especially when other players contribute more tokens. The failure seems to stem from not effectively anticipating and adapting to the contributions of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_4 could be to adopt a more strategic approach based on the observed behavior of other players. This could involve tracking the average contribution of other players and adjusting own contributions to match or slightly exceed that average when the total contribution is likely to result in a higher multiplier for the public pot. Additionally, player_4 should consider contributing more tokens when the public pot is likely to be larger due to higher contributions from others, and hold back when others contribute very little to avoid potential free-ridership. This dynamic and adaptive strategy should lead to more optimal token allocation and increased gains over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 4's token contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, ranging from contributing as low as 2 tokens to as high as 10 tokens. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't seem to effectively balance personal gain with contributing to the public good. To mitigate this failure, Player 4 should adopt a more consistent and strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens or using a threshold-based strategy where they contribute more when others' contributions are high, ensuring a more balanced and potentially more rewarding participation in the game.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (myself) has been contributing tokens to the public pot with some consistency, but not always in a way that maximizes personal gain. There are instances where contributing more tokens would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier on the public pot. However, there are also rounds where contributing fewer tokens would have been more beneficial, especially when other players contribute less, reducing the overall pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. I should consider the contributions of other players and adjust my own contribution accordingly. If others are contributing significantly, I should contribute more to take advantage of the larger pot. Conversely, if others are contributing less, I should contribute less to conserve tokens. Additionally, I should aim to balance my contributions to avoid depleting my private tokens too quickly while still benefiting from the public good. This adaptive strategy should lead to better long-term gains.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's contribution strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute more tokens.

A potential high-level plan is to contribute tokens in a way that matches the average contribution of the other players, ensuring a fair share of the public good without over-contributing when others do not. Additionally, player_4 should avoid contributing significantly more tokens than the average, as this often results in a lower individual payoff due to the even division of the public good. By adjusting contributions based on the observed behavior of other players, player_4 can optimize their long-term token accumulation.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that Player 4's strategy is not consistently optimized for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute more tokens. For example, in Round 21, contributing fewer tokens led to a lower gain compared to the average contribution of other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, Player 4 should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players. A high-level plan could be to contribute tokens equal to or slightly above the average contribution of other players in order to benefit from the larger public good multiplier while ensuring a fair share of the payoff. Additionally, in rounds where other players contribute significantly less, Player 4 should consider conserving tokens to avoid subsidizing the public good without receiving proportionate benefits. This balanced approach should lead to more consistent gains over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's contribution strategy is not consistently aligned with the potential for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher individual payoff, especially when other players contribute more tokens.

The new plan is to monitor the average contribution of the other players and adjust contributions accordingly. If the average contribution is high, player_4 should contribute more to take advantage of the larger public good payoff. Conversely, if the average contribution is low, player_4 should contribute less to conserve tokens. This way, player_4 can balance the risk of contributing to a potentially small public good with the potential for a larger payoff when others also contribute significantly.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's token contributions are not consistently aligned with the potential for maximizing gains. There are instances where contributing more tokens to the public pot would have resulted in a higher payoff due to the 2x multiplier, but player_4 chose to contribute less. For example, in Round 21, contributing 10 tokens led to a low gain of 0.4, while in Round 22, contributing only 2 tokens resulted in a much higher gain of 6.0.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic approach, considering the contributions of other players and the potential for a higher multiplier effect. If the majority of other players are contributing more tokens, it might be beneficial for player_4 to do the same in order to capitalize on the larger public pot. Conversely, if other players are contributing fewer tokens, it might be wiser to contribute less to avoid potential free-ridership. By dynamically adjusting contributions based on the actions of others and the potential for a larger payout, player_4 can optimize their long-term token accumulation.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 4 (you) has been contributing an inconsistent number of tokens to the public pot, with a tendency to contribute less than the average contribution of other players. This strategy seems to have resulted in a fluctuating token balance, sometimes gaining less than the potential payoff. To improve, a more strategic approach would be to contribute an amount close to the average contribution of other players, ensuring a fair share of the public good payoff while avoiding over-contributing and depleting your private tokens unnecessarily. This can be achieved by observing the average contribution in previous rounds and adjusting your contribution accordingly.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good dynamics. In some rounds, player_4 contributes more tokens when others contribute less, leading to a lower individual gain (e.g., Round 21), while in other rounds, contributing less when others contribute more results in a higher gain (e.g., Round 22).\n\nTo mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic approach. A potential high-level plan is to adopt a conditional contribution strategy, where they contribute more tokens when the average contribution of other players is high, and less when it's low. This can be achieved by estimating the average contribution in the previous few rounds and adjusting the contribution accordingly to maximize the benefit from the public good. Additionally, player_4 should consider a threshold for the minimum return on investment, contributing only when the expected gain is likely to surpass the cost of the contribution.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's contribution strategy is inconsistent, often contributing less than the average number of tokens contributed by other players. This may result in lower gains compared to more cooperative players, as the public good payoff is multiplied by the total tokens in the pot and then evenly divided. To mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing the average amount contributed by other players in the previous round, or contributing slightly more to encourage others to contribute as well. This way, player_4 can potentially benefit from a larger public pot while maintaining a balanced contribution level.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 4 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their gains. There seems to be a lack of strategic coordination with other players, as contributions are not always aligned with the highest paying rounds.

This way, Player 4 can better balance their contributions with the expected public good payoff.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a reason for suboptimal performance, as it doesn't effectively exploit the public good dynamics.

Player_4 should aim to contribute tokens in a way that maximizes the expected return, considering the contributions of other players. If others are contributing more, player_4 should contribute less to avoid free-riding. If others contribute less, player_4 should contribute more to potentially benefit from a higher multiplier on the public pot. This can be achieved by monitoring the average contributions of other players and adjusting contributions accordingly, while also factoring in the current token balance to minimize risk.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a result of not effectively anticipating the collective contributions of other players or not optimizing for the long-term average gain. To mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens based on the average contribution of previous rounds, ensuring a balance between personal gain and contribution to the public good. This way, player_4 can adapt to the dynamics of the game while maximizing their overall tokens over time.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that Player 4 is not consistently contributing tokens to the public pot in a way that maximizes their long-term gain.

This way, Player 4 can balance their contributions to optimize their individual payoff while taking into account the behavior of other players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's strategy is to contribute an average of 3 tokens per round, with occasional higher contributions. This strategy seems to result in a mixed outcome, with gains ranging from 1.2 to 5.4 tokens per round. The failure lies in not adapting the contribution to the actions of other players, which could lead to missed opportunities for higher gains when others contribute more, and potentially over-contributing when others contribute less.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan for player_4 would be to adopt a more dynamic strategy. This could involve observing the average contribution of other players and adjusting contributions accordingly. If the average contribution of others is high, player_4 should consider contributing more to maximize the public good payoff. Conversely, if others contribute less, player_4 should contribute less to conserve tokens. Additionally, player_4 should consider the potential for free-riding when others contribute significantly more, and weigh the benefits of contributing against the risk of diluting the reward. This adaptive approach should lead to more consistent gains and better overall performance.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that player_4's contribution strategy is somewhat inconsistent, with contributions ranging from 2 to 5 tokens. This inconsistency could be a result of not effectively anticipating the collective contributions of other players or not optimizing for the long-term average gain. To mitigate this failure, player_4 should adopt a more strategic approach, such as contributing a fixed percentage of their tokens based on the average contribution of previous rounds, or using a Tit-for-Tat strategy where they match the previous round's contribution of the most successful player. This would help to better align contributions with potential payoffs and stabilize token accumulation over time.\n",
