          "content": "\n\nYou are participating in a game played by 5 players over 34 rounds.\n\nGame Rules:\n\n1. In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Target Optimal Contribution: Determine the optimal number of tokens to contribute in each round. If the average contribution is low, contributing more might be beneficial. If the average is high, contributing less might be more advantageous. Aim for a contribution level that maximizes the expected gain while minimizing the risk of a low return.\n - Monitor Average Gains: Calculate the average gain per round for all players and compare it to your own. If your gains are consistently lower, consider contributing more to the public pot to potentially increase your share. If your gains are consistently higher, you might want to contribute less to avoid being a target for exploitation.\n - Experimentation: Since the current strategy seems to be leading to decreasing returns, consider experimenting with different contribution amounts in the next few rounds to find the optimal balance between contributing to the public pot and retaining tokens.\n - Avoid Over-Reliance: While exploiting others' patterns can be beneficial, don't solely rely on it. Be prepared for changes in their behavior, especially towards the end of the game when players might adjust their strategies to optimize their final token count.\n - Targeted Contribution: If possible, aim to contribute just enough to push the public pot to a multiple of 2 (e.g., 10, 12, 14, etc.) to maximize the multiplier effect. This might encourage others to contribute as well, creating a larger public pot.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

        "27": "Track the Average: Keep monitoring the average token count after each round. If you notice that the average is decreasing, it might be a good opportunity to contribute more to catch up. If the average is increasing, you might want to be more conservative with your contributions.",
        "28": "Endgame Strategy: As the game progresses, the remaining rounds become more critical. You have 10 more rounds to reach your target. Consider becoming more aggressive in your strategy if you're still below the average, but also be mindful of not falling too far behind if you make a wrong prediction.",
        "29": "Safety Net: Given that you need a significant gain in the final round, consider contributing enough tokens to ensure a minimum gain, even if it's not the optimal strategy. This could help you reach the 30-token threshold.",

In rounds where others contribute more, player_0 might want to contribute slightly more to avoid being seen as a free-rider. Conversely, if others contribute less, player_0 can contribute less as well.",
        "36": "Assess the situation: Player_0 should note that their token count has been relatively stable around 21.6 for the last few rounds. This suggests that other players might also be trying to maintain a balance or are unsure about their strategies.",
        "37": "Cooperation: Alternatively, if some players are close to their target of 30 tokens, they might choose to cooperate and contribute more to help each other reach the goal. Player_0 should consider whether this is a possibility and if it's in their best interest to join in.",
        "38": "Final push: If player_0 is confident that a larger contribution will lead to a net gain, they could consider making a slightly higher contribution to reach the 30-token goal.",
        "39": "Signal and Influence: If possible, player_0 could try to signal their intentions to other players, either directly or indirectly, to encourage or discourage certain behaviors. This could lead to more cooperative rounds or deter others from over-contributing.",
        "40": "Anticipate and Adapt to Changes: Player_0 should be prepared for potential changes in other players' strategies. If others start contributing more or less, player_0 should adjust their own contributions accordingly to maintain a fair balance.",
        "41": "Risk Management: With a current token count of 21.8, player_0 is close to the target of 30 tokens. To avoid losing ground, player_0 should be cautious about contributing too much in a single round, which could lead to a lower gain if the public pot is small.",
        "42": "Maintain Consistency: Continue contributing 2 tokens to align with the group's behavior, maintaining a stable public pot and ensuring a consistent gain.",
        "43": "Coordination or Free-Riding: If you think other players will contribute more, you might choose to contribute less to benefit from their contributions (free-riding). Conversely, if you anticipate low contributions, contributing more could lead to a higher individual payoff.",
        "44": "Predicting Others' Behavior: Try to anticipate how other players will react to your past contributions and their own experiences. If they've noticed a pattern in your contributions, they might adjust their behavior accordingly.",
        "45": "Adaptability: Be prepared to change your strategy based on the actual contributions of other players once they are revealed.",
        "46": "Predictive Modeling: Try to predict the next round's pot size based on the past few rounds. If the pot size has been consistently lower than your prediction, reduce your contribution. If it's consistently higher, increase your contribution.",
        "47": "Avoid Over-contributing: Since your token count is now lower after Round 8, it's crucial to avoid over-contributing to the public pot, especially when the contributions from other players are low. This will help you retain more tokens for yourself.",
        "48": "Predict and Adapt: Try to predict the behavior of other players and adapt your strategy accordingly. If you notice a pattern, such as players contributing less as the game progresses, you might want to adjust your contributions accordingly.",
        "49": "Analyze Contribution Trends: Notice that player_0 has been contributing 1 or 2 tokens consistently, with a slight preference for 2 tokens. Observe that the public pot contributions have been fluctuating, with no clear pattern. This suggests that player_0 should continue monitoring the contributions of others to identify any emerging trends.",
        "50": "Set a Threshold for Contributions: Establish a threshold for the minimum number of tokens in the public pot that would justify contributing more than 1 token. For example, if the pot is below 8 tokens, contribute 1 token; if it's above 8 tokens, consider contributing 2 tokens.",
        "51": "Maintain a Stable Token Balance: You have been hovering around the 21-23 token range. Aim to maintain this balance while trying to increase it slightly to reach the target of 30 tokens.",
        "52": "Exploit Inconsistencies: In Round 13, you benefited from others' lower contributions by contributing only 1 token. Look for similar opportunities in future rounds.",
        "53": "Collaboration Opportunity: Although there's no clear alliance, consider if there's a pattern in other players' contributions that could indicate a potential collaboration. For instance, if some players consistently contribute more, try to align with their contributions.",
        "54": "Risk Management: As the game progresses, the risk of losing tokens becomes higher. Aim to contribute just enough to ensure a positive gain while minimizing the risk of a low multiplier.",
        "55": "Late-Game Surge: If you find yourself falling behind, consider increasing your contributions in the later rounds to make up for the deficit. However, this strategy should be balanced with the risk of over-contributing and losing tokens.",
        "56": "Contribution Variability: Notice that the contributions of other players are not consistent. Some rounds have more tokens contributed, while others have less. This suggests that players are likely adjusting their strategies based on the previous round's outcomes or their own observations.",
        "57": "Equal or Near-Equal Contributions: In rounds where multiple players contribute the same amount (e.g., round 13), it might suggest a coordinated effort or a response to a perceived optimal strategy. Keep an eye on these instances, as they might indicate a shift in the game's dynamics.",
        "58": "Individual Focus: Some players, like player_0, seem to be more focused on their own token count rather than contributing significantly to the public pot. This could mean that players are more concerned with their private token accumulation, which might lead to more conservative contributions in the future.",
        "59": "Average Contribution: Calculate the average contribution per player over the last few rounds to identify any trends. If the average is increasing or decreasing, it might indicate a shift in the overall strategy of the group.",
        "60": "Consistency in Pairwise Contributions: Look for any consistent patterns in the contributions of pairs or small groups of players. This could suggest cooperation or competition between them.",
        "61": "Maintain a Token Buffer: Since player_0 has 21.8 tokens and needs 8.2 more tokens, they should aim to maintain a buffer of at least 5 tokens (to reach 26.8 tokens) to account for potential low returns from the public pot.",
        "62": "Adaptability: Continuously monitor the game's progress and adjust the strategy as needed. If the game dynamics change, player_0 should be ready to change their approach.",
        "63": "Balance Risk and Reward: In Round 5, you contributed less (1 token) and still gained more (2.6 tokens) due to the higher multiplication factor. Analyze the potential multiplication factor based on the total contributions and decide whether to contribute more or less to maximize your gain.",
        "64": "Adapt to Changes: Monitor the game dynamics and adjust your strategy accordingly. If you notice a pattern where contributing less results in a higher individual gain, consider shifting your strategy.",
        "65": "Coordination (if possible): If you can communicate or infer other players' strategies, try to coordinate with those who might be contributing consistently. This could lead to a more stable public pot and better payoffs.",
        "66": "Buffer Target: Aim to maintain a buffer of at least 3 tokens. This would give you a cushion against one or two rounds with lower returns without falling below your desired token count.",
        "67": "Contribution Strategy: Observe the average contribution of other players. If they tend to contribute more, you might want to contribute less to benefit from their contributions. If they contribute less, contributing more could lead to a higher individual payoff. However, always consider the potential multiplication factor and the risk of a low public pot.",
        "68": "Target Optimal Gains: Calculate the expected gain from contributing to the public pot based on the current pot size and the multiplication factor (2). If the expected gain is less than the token contributed, consider retaining the token for personal gain.",
        "69": "Anticipate Endgame Scenarios: As the game progresses, the endgame is getting closer. Players might become more risk-averse or cooperative. Be prepared to adjust your strategy accordingly, especially if you notice a shift in the behavior of other players.",
        "70": "Avoid Consecutive Low Pot Contributions: If the public pot has been small for several rounds, it might be a good idea to contribute slightly more in the next round, assuming others might do the same, potentially creating a larger public good.",
        "71": "Learning from Others: Analyze the strategies of other players and try to identify any patterns or tendencies. If possible, coordinate with players who have similar strategies to maximize the public good's value.",
        "72": "Avoid Conformity: While consistency is important, don't blindly follow the crowd. Analyze each round's context and make informed decisions based on the game's dynamics.",
        "73": "Endgame Strategy: As the game progresses, the importance of maintaining a buffer increases. In the later rounds, you might want to be more conservative with your contributions to ensure you meet your target.",
        "74": "Avoid Over-contributing: Notice that contributing more than others doesn't always result in a higher gain (e.g., Round 1). Be cautious not to over-contribute, as it can lead to a lower individual payoff.",
        "75": "Final Round Push: If you're still short of your goal in the last few rounds, you might consider taking a higher risk by contributing more tokens in the hope of a larger public pot, especially if you see other players doing the same.",
        "76": "Equal Gain Strategy: If you can predict that all players will contribute the same amount, contributing the minimum to reach the threshold for a positive gain might be optimal, as the public pot will be evenly divided among all players.",
        "77": "Consider the Impact of Your Contribution: If you increase your contribution, it might encourage others to do the same, potentially increasing the public pot's value. However, it could also lead to a situation where you are contributing more than others, reducing your individual gain.",
        "78": "Target Higher Pot Sizes: Since the public pot size seems to be fluctuating between 6 and 13 tokens, aim to contribute more when you anticipate a larger pot. This could happen when other players are also contributing more tokens.",
        "79": "Endgame Strategy: As the game progresses, the remaining rounds become more critical. You might want to increase your contribution slightly in the last few rounds to maximize the potential for a larger public good payoff, but only if you believe it will result in a net gain.",
        "80": "Coordination Observation: Keep track of other players' contributions and try to identify any patterns or trends. If you notice that others are consistently contributing less, you might want to increase your contribution to take advantage of the higher multiplier.",
        "81": "Avoiding Ties: If possible, try to maintain a token count that is not easily matched by other players. This can help you avoid ending up with the same number of tokens as others, which could lead to a tie and potentially a lower average gain.",
        "82": "Exploit Inconsistencies: If you notice that other players are less likely to contribute when you do, you might want to exploit this by contributing more when you predict others will contribute less, maximizing the multiplier effect.",
        "83": "Relative Position: After Round 4, you have 21.6 tokens, which places you in the middle of the pack. Two players have slightly more tokens, and two have slightly fewer.",
        "84": "Risk Assessment: Since you're not significantly ahead or behind, you need to balance risk and reward. If you're too conservative, you might fall behind, but if you're too aggressive, you risk losing your current position.",
        "85": "Evaluate Public Pot Efficiency: The public pot's size has varied between 7 and 13 tokens. Analyze the relationship between the pot size and your gain. If the pot size is consistently low, contributing more might not be worth the risk.",
        "86": "Monitor Token Distributions: Your token count is close to other players. If you notice a player consistently gaining more tokens, consider increasing your contribution to catch up or maintain your position.",
        "87": "Endgame Strategy: As the game progresses, the endgame becomes more critical. If you're close to reaching your target of 30 tokens, you might want to become more conservative to protect your lead. If you're lagging, consider taking a more aggressive approach.",
        "88": "Evaluate Personal Strategy: Your contributions have been relatively consistent (mainly 2 tokens), which might make you predictable. Consider varying your contributions to avoid being exploited by other players who might adjust their strategies based on your pattern.",
        "89": "Monitor Others' Gains: Notice that your gains have been fluctuating, but generally low. This could indicate that other players are adjusting their contributions to maximize their individual payoffs. Keep an eye on their gains to understand if they are benefiting more from your contributions.",
        "90": "React to Changes: If you notice a sudden increase in contributions from others, it might be a signal that they are trying to exploit a larger public good. In such cases, consider contributing less to avoid diluting your own rewards.",
        "91": "Maintain a Consistent Strategy: Since contributing 2 tokens in the last few rounds has resulted in an average gain of around 1.6 to 2.6 tokens, it might be beneficial to continue this strategy, as it aligns with your target average gain.",
        "92": "Targeted Gains: In each round, aim for a gain that will help you stay on track with your average gain target. For example, if you are below the average after a round, you might need to contribute more in the following round to catch up.",
        "93": "Collaboration or Competition: If possible, try to gauge if any collaboration or competition is occurring among the players. If you sense a pattern of cooperation, contributing more might be beneficial. If it's a competitive environment, you might want to focus on retaining tokens for yourself.",
        "94": "Risk-Aversion: In rounds where the public pot is smaller (e.g., rounds 9 and 11), you contributed more tokens, but gained less. This might indicate that other players are also becoming more risk-averse when the pot is smaller, contributing less to avoid potential low payoffs.",
        "95": "Equalizing Strategy: In some rounds (e.g., rounds 10 and 12), the tokens contributed by other players seem to be evening out, possibly to maintain a similar token count among themselves. This could indicate a desire to avoid falling behind or getting too far ahead.",
        "96": "Maintain a balance: You've been contributing 1 or 2 tokens consistently, which seems to be a balanced approach. Continue this strategy, but be prepared to adjust based on the pot size and other players' contributions.",
        "97": "Monitor opponents' patterns: Observe that other players' contributions are not very predictable. Keep track of their tendencies to contribute 1 or 2 tokens, and if you notice a pattern, exploit it by adjusting your contribution accordingly.",
        "98": "Equalize gains: In some rounds, you've gained more tokens (e.g., Round 5 and 13), while in others, you've gained less (e.g., Round 9 and 11). Aim for rounds where you can make up for the lower gains by contributing strategically when the pot is likely to result in a higher payoff.",
        "99": "Coordination without communication: Although you can't directly communicate with other players, you can try to coordinate your contributions indirectly by observing their behavior and adjusting yours to create a more beneficial outcome for yourself.",
        "100": "Late-Game Adjustments: As the game progresses, players might become more conservative with their tokens to reach the 30-token goal. Be prepared for lower average contributions from others in the later rounds.",
        "101": "Maintaining a Buffer: Since your current token count is around 21.2, it's crucial to maintain a buffer to ensure you reach the 30-token goal. Avoid contributing too much in a single round, which could risk dropping your token count significantly.",
        "102": "Opportunistic Strategy: If you notice a round where other players contribute less, consider contributing more to take advantage of the higher multiplier on the public pot.",
        "103": "Predictive Modeling: Try to estimate if players will continue their current pattern or if they will adjust based on their previous gains. If they have lost tokens due to low contributions, they might increase their contributions in the next round.",
        "104": "Counter-Strategies: If you anticipate more free-riding, consider contributing slightly more to compensate and potentially benefit from the higher multiplier. However, be cautious not to over-contribute, as this could lead to a net loss.",
        "105": "Coordination: Although informal, try to identify if there are any patterns or groups forming among the players. If you can predict their collective behavior, it could inform your own strategy.",
        "106": "Risk vs. Reward: Since you have 22.2 tokens after round 15, you're close to your target of 30 tokens. You might want to play more conservatively to protect your current balance, contributing just enough to ensure a small gain without risking a significant loss.",

        "134": "Late-game strategy: As the game progresses and you get closer to the end, you might need to be more aggressive in your contributions if you're falling short of your target, but also be cautious of over-contributing if the public pot isn't growing significantly.",
        "135": "Coordination and Cooperation: Attempting to coordinate with other players, either informally or through signaling, could be a sub-goal. If you can form a group that contributes consistently, you might create a situation where the public good is more valuable, benefiting all group members.",
        "136": "Safety Net: You started with 10 tokens and ended Round 1 with 14.2 tokens. To maintain a safety net, you might set a target to end each round with at least 15 tokens in your private collection. This would provide a buffer against potential low returns in future rounds.",
        "137": "Predicting Others' Behavior: Since multiple players contributed 3 tokens in Round 1, it's possible that they might continue to do so if they believe it's beneficial. If you expect this pattern to continue, contributing less could be advantageous.",
        "138": "Adaptation: If you observe that the public pot's efficiency is consistently low, you might shift your strategy to focus more on retaining tokens rather than contributing to the public pot. However, if you anticipate that others might also reduce their contributions, contributing more could lead to a higher relative gain.",
        "139": "Avoiding Over-Reliance: Given the low return on investment in Round 1, it's crucial not to over-rely on the public pot for token accumulation. Focus on maintaining a balance between contributing to the public good and accumulating tokens through non-contributions.",
        "140": "Targeted Contribution: Since the average contribution is low, consider contributing 1 token more than the average to take advantage of the multiplier without over-contributing. This might lead to a higher individual gain.",
        "141": "Risk Management: Given the variability in your gains, maintain a balance between contributing to the public pot and retaining tokens for your private collection. Aim to have a safety net of tokens to ensure you reach your primary goal.",
        "142": "Risk Assessment: Weigh the potential gain from contributing more against the risk of over-contributing. If you believe that others will also increase their contributions, it might be safer to maintain or slightly increase your contribution.",
        "143": "Consistency: If you think that maintaining a consistent contribution strategy might be beneficial, stick with a similar contribution level (e.g., 2 or 3 tokens) to avoid signaling any changes to other players.",
        "144": "Target Specific Rounds: Since you have a limited number of rounds left, target the rounds where the public pot could multiply to a higher value (e.g., when the total contributions are close to a multiple of 5, as the multiplier is 2). This round (14) could be such an opportunity if others also contribute.",
        "145": "Monitor Payoff Gaps: Keep track of the token differences between you and other players. If the gap is closing, it might be safer to continue with the riskier strategy. If the gap is widening, you might need to reevaluate and adjust your approach.",
        "146": "Adapt to Changes: If your risk-taking strategy doesn't yield the desired results, be prepared to switch back to a more conservative approach or adjust your contribution based on the evolving game dynamics.",
        "147": "Predicting Future Contributions: Given the trend of decreasing contributions, it's reasonable to expect that players might continue to contribute less in the next rounds. However, be prepared for potential shifts if the public pot's value becomes more attractive due to higher contributions from others.",
        "148": "Consistency in Others' Contributions: Notice that there is no clear pattern in the contributions of other players. Keep monitoring their contributions to identify any emerging patterns or consistency.",
        "149": "Optimal Contribution: Consider the average contribution of others and adjust your contribution to maximize the multiplication factor while minimizing the risk of over-contributing.",
        "150": "Learning from Past Mistakes: Analyze your past decisions and their outcomes. Adjust your strategy to avoid repeating patterns of over-contributing in rounds with low public pot sizes.",
        "151": "Anticipating Strategic Adjustments: Players might start to adapt their strategies based on their current token counts. If someone is significantly behind or ahead, they might take more risks or become more conservative, respectively.",
        "152": "Contribution Pattern: There seems to be no clear pattern in the contributions of other players. However, there are instances where two or more players contribute the same amount, indicating that they might be trying to coordinate or respond to each other's actions.",
        "153": "Optimal Contribution: Your gains have been more consistent when contributing 1 token, with occasional higher gains when contributing 2 when the public pot is larger. This suggests that contributing 1 token might be a safer strategy, while contributing 2 tokens could be more rewarding when others also contribute more.",
        "154": "Divergence Strategy: If you observe that consistently contributing less than others is leading to higher payoffs, you might want to adopt a competitive strategy by contributing less than the average contribution of others.",
        "155": "Risk Assessment: Consider contributing less when the public pot's size is relatively small to avoid potential low returns due to the 2x multiplier.",
        "156": "Predictive Analysis: Observe the patterns in other players' contributions. Use this information to predict when the public pot might be larger.",
        "157": "Buffer Utilization: Target rounds where the public pot is likely to be 8 tokens or more. Contribute more tokens in these rounds to maximize the benefit from the multiplier.",
        "158": "Safety Net: Keep a minimum buffer of 1.4 tokens in reserve for the remaining rounds to remain above the average gain.",
        "159": "Adaptability: Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on the game's evolving dynamics. If there's a consistent pattern of low contributions, focus on retaining tokens rather than contributing.",
        "160": "Late-Game Aggressiveness: Since you're slightly behind your target, you might need to be more aggressive in the remaining rounds. However, this should be done cautiously, as it increases the risk of losing tokens if the public pot doesn't yield a high enough multiplier.",
        "161": "Track Others' Contributions: Notice that other players' contributions are generally between 1 and 2 tokens. This suggests a cautious approach. Keep an eye on any changes in their behavior, as it might indicate a shift in strategy.",
        "162": "Predict Public Pot Size: Given the recent history, the public pot has been around 7-9 tokens. Use this information to estimate your potential gain and adjust your contribution accordingly.",
        "163": "Avoid Being a Freerider: If you consistently contribute less than others, they might adjust their contributions downward, reducing the public pot's value. Contribute enough to maintain the pot's attractiveness but not so much that you are exploited.",
        "164": "Risk-averse Strategy: Given that you are close to other players' token counts, a risk-averse strategy might be more appropriate. This could involve contributing slightly less than the average contribution of others to maintain your position while benefiting from their contributions.",
        "165": "Buffer for Future Rounds: With only 3 rounds left, it's crucial to have a safety net. Aim to retain enough tokens to ensure you can adapt to any changes in the game dynamics or other players' strategies.",
        "166": "Information Gathering: Pay attention to the game master's announcements to understand how your contributions affect your gain and the overall game dynamics. This information can help you make better decisions in the upcoming rounds.",
        "167": "Balance between Gains and Losses: Calculate the average return on your contributions so far and compare it to the average contribution. If the return is consistently lower than your contribution, consider reducing your contributions in the remaining rounds.",
        "168": "Avoid Over-Reliance: While exploiting others' patterns can be beneficial, don't solely rely on it. Be prepared for changes in their behavior, especially towards the end of the game when players might adjust their strategies to optimize their final token count.",
        "169": "Coordination (if possible): If you can communicate or infer that other players are also aiming for an even distribution, try to coordinate your contributions to reach the 10-token mark without over-contributing.",
        "170": "Endgame Strategy: As the game nears its end, players are likely to become more protective of their tokens, contributing less to the public pot to secure their position. This could result in smaller public pots, so you need to adjust your strategy accordingly.",
        "171": "Conserving Tokens: Alternatively, you might choose to conserve tokens by contributing minimally, hoping that others will contribute enough to create a decent public pot. This strategy is less risky but may not guarantee the tokens you need.",
        "172": "Avoiding Over-contributing: Focus on contributing just enough to maintain or slightly increase your token count.",
        "173": "Contribution Analysis: In rounds 9 and 11, you contributed 2 tokens to the public pot when the average contribution was lower (1 or 1.5 tokens). This led to a lower multiplication factor (6 tokens in the pot) and a smaller share of the public good. In these situations, contributing less might have been more beneficial.",
        "174": "Risk vs. Reward: In rounds with higher contributions from others, contributing more might lead to a better payoff. However, if the total contribution is low, contributing less might be safer, as the public good's value will be lower.",
        "175": "Targeted Contribution: If possible, aim to contribute just enough to push the public pot to a multiple of 2 (e.g., 10, 12, 14, etc.) to maximize the multiplier effect. This might encourage others to contribute as well, creating a larger public pot.",
        "176": "Monitor Other Players' Tokens: Keep track of the tokens each player has. If others are close to or have surpassed 30 tokens, player_0 might need to increase their contribution to keep up."

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Predicting Others' Behavior: Observe that other players also tend to contribute 1 or 2 tokens. If you anticipate that this pattern will continue, contributing 1 token might be a safer choice, as it would likely result in a small gain while minimizing the risk of a net loss.\n - Coordination: Although it's challenging to coordinate in a secret contribution game, you can try to infer if there are any patterns or potential coalitions forming. If you notice a group consistently contributing more, consider matching their contributions to benefit from the larger public pot.\n - Track Others' Contributions: Keep track of the contribution patterns of other players. If you notice a trend of increasing or decreasing contributions, adjust your own contribution to maintain the average.\n - Consistency vs. Adaptability: Consider adapting your contribution based on the observed behavior of other players. If others are contributing less, you might want to contribute more to potentially benefit from the multiplier.\n - Conservative Strategy: Given the buffer goal, you might consider contributing a smaller number of tokens in the next round to minimize the risk of losing a significant portion of your tokens if the public pot multiplier results in a low gain.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

You might continue this strategy unless you observe a clear pattern of higher gains from contributing more.",
        "8": "Balancing Individual and Group Interests: If you notice that your gains are consistently lower than the average gain per player, it might be time to adjust your strategy. This could mean either contributing more to align with the group's behavior or contributing less to exploit the situation.",
        "9": "Observation and Adaptation: Keep track of the average contribution of other players and adjust your contribution accordingly to benefit from their generosity or to maximize individual payoff.",

Consider maintaining this strategy if it continues to yield a positive return.",
        "11": "Coordination or Influence: If possible, try to gauge if any other players are open to coordinating their contributions. This could lead to a more stable public pot and potentially higher payoffs for all involved. However, this is challenging in a one-shot game without communication.",

        "40": "Predict Public Pot Multiplier: Based on the past rounds, the public pot multiplier (2) has resulted in a gain that is less than the tokens contributed. This suggests that contributing more tokens might not always lead to a higher individual payoff. Be cautious with your contributions.",
        "41": "Predicting Endgame: As the game progresses, the endgame becomes closer. You might want to adjust your strategy to ensure you reach your target of 30 tokens. If you're close, you could choose to contribute less to safeguard your tokens. If you're further away, you might need to take a slightly more aggressive approach.",
        "42": "Predicting Others' Behavior: Observe that other players also tend to contribute 1 or 2 tokens. If you anticipate that this pattern will continue, contributing 1 token might be a safer choice, as it would likely result in a small gain while minimizing the risk of a net loss.",
        "43": "Buffer for Unexpected Events: Given that you have a relatively low token count, it's crucial to maintain a buffer for any unexpected high contributions from others or a change in the game dynamics.",
        "44": "Anticipate Others' Strategies: Try to predict if other players are also aiming for a buffer. If so, they might also be conservative in their contributions, which could impact your decision.",
        "45": "Adapt to Changing Dynamics: Monitor the game's progress and adjust your strategy as needed. If you notice a pattern of low contributions, it might be time to contribute more to take advantage of the multiplier.",

        "50": "Predicting Future Rounds: Estimate the average contribution per player for the remaining rounds. If it seems that the average will be high, consider contributing less to benefit from the public good. If the average is expected to be low, a moderate contribution might be more appropriate.",
        "51": "Risk Assessment: Evaluate the risk of each round. If the public pot seems likely to yield a low return, it might be better to retain tokens in your private collection. Conversely, if the pot seems likely to yield a high return, you can cautiously contribute to maximize your gain.",
        "52": "Buffer Management: Set a target for the buffer you want to achieve by the end of each round. For instance, you might aim to have a buffer of 3 tokens by the end of the next round. This will guide your decision-making process for the upcoming contribution.",
        "53": "Monitor Progress: Keep track of your tokens and the tokens of other players. If you see that your buffer is dwindling or other players are accumulating tokens rapidly, adjust your strategy accordingly.",
        "54": "End-Game Push: If significantly behind the target after Round 8 or 9, consider a more aggressive approach in the final round. Weigh the risks against the potential rewards.",
        "55": "Track the Average: Continue monitoring the average contribution of other players. If it stays around 1.5 tokens, you might want to stick to contributing 1 or 2 tokens, depending on whether you want to slightly over-contribute or play it safer.",
        "56": "React to Variance: If you notice a round where other players contribute significantly more or less, adjust your contribution accordingly. If they contribute more, you might want to contribute less to benefit from their largesse. If they contribute less, contributing more could lead to a higher individual payoff.",
        "57": "Consider Positional Advantage: In later rounds, players might be more risk-averse, as they approach their target token count. If you're ahead or near your target, consider contributing less to protect your position. If you're behind, you might need to take more risks to catch up.",
        "58": "Anticipate Others' Behavior: If you notice that other players are consistently contributing less, they might be adopting a similar risk assessment strategy. Be prepared for potential changes in their behavior, especially if the game is nearing its end.",
        "59": "Diversify Risk: Instead of consistently contributing the same amount, vary your contributions to balance risk and reward. This can help you adapt to changing circumstances and avoid being predictable.",
        "60": "Monitor Your Token Count: Keep a close eye on your token count and the counts of other players. If you're close to your target, you might want to focus on preserving your tokens rather than seeking additional gains.",
        "61": "Maintain or exceed the average: Your current token count (21.2) is slightly above the average tokens held by other players (21.4). To maintain or improve your position, you should aim to keep pace with or outperform the average contribution of other players.",
        "62": "Coordination: Although it's challenging to coordinate in a secret contribution game, you can try to infer if there are any patterns or potential coalitions forming. If you notice a group consistently contributing more, consider matching their contributions to benefit from the larger public pot.",
        "63": "Maintain a Consistent Contribution: Contribute around the average amount, which is currently 1.5 tokens, to blend in with the group. This will help avoid being a target for exploitation while still benefiting from the public pot.",
        "64": "Track Others' Contributions: Keep track of the contribution patterns of other players. If you notice a trend of increasing or decreasing contributions, adjust your own contribution to maintain the average.",
        "65": "Coordination: Although it's challenging in a one-shot game, try to infer if there's any pattern or cooperation among other players. If you can predict their behavior, you can adjust your strategy accordingly.",
        "66": "Consider the Impact of Others' Strategies: If other players seem to be targeting the same multiples of 2 as you, adjust your strategy to avoid directly competing with them. This could mean contributing slightly more or less to create a different multiple.",
        "67": "Token Count: Player_1 currently has 22.2 tokens. To reach the target of 30 tokens, an additional 7.8 tokens are needed over the remaining rounds. With an average gain of 1.5 tokens per round from contributing 2 tokens, reaching the goal is feasible but requires careful planning.",
        "68": "Avoid Overconfidence: Given the consistent gains from contributing 2 tokens, it's tempting to continue this strategy. However, be aware of the potential for other players to change their behavior in the final round, which could impact your gain.",
        "69": "Consistency vs. Adaptability: Consider adapting your contribution based on the observed behavior of other players. If others are contributing less, you might want to contribute more to potentially benefit from the multiplier.",
        "70": "Avoid Conformity: Don't always follow the crowd. If everyone else is contributing 1 token, consider contributing 2 tokens to potentially exploit a larger pot, especially if you think others might be under-contributing.",
        "71": "Adaptability: Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on the actual contributions in the current round. If the pot is smaller than expected, quickly adjust your contribution for the next round.",
        "72": "Maintain a Safety Net: Balance your contributions to ensure you don't fall below a comfortable safety net while still striving to reach your target.",
        "73": "Conservative Strategy: Given the buffer goal, you might consider contributing a smaller number of tokens in the next round to minimize the risk of losing a significant portion of your tokens if the public pot multiplier results in a low gain.",
        "74": "Predicting Others' Behavior: Observe the pattern of other players' contributions. If they tend to contribute less when you contribute more, you might want to follow their lead to avoid over-contributing.",
        "75": "Buffer Management: You started with 15 tokens and currently have 20.8 tokens. Aim to maintain a buffer of at least 5 tokens to ensure a safety net against potential low returns from the public pot. This will also allow you to take calculated risks when necessary.",
        "76": "Consistency: Maintaining a consistent contribution strategy can help you predict your potential gains and manage your tokens better. However, be prepared to deviate from this strategy if the situation demands it.",
        "77": "Contribution Pattern Analysis: It seems that other players are contributing an average of 1.5 to 2 tokens per round. In rounds where you contributed more, your gain was lower, while in rounds where you contributed less, your gain was higher. This suggests that contributing less might be more beneficial when others are contributing more.",
        "78": "Pot Size and Multiplier: The public pot multiplier is 2, which means that a pot of 6 tokens will result in a 12-token public good, while a pot of 13 tokens will result in a 26-token public good. However, the gains are divided equally among all players, so a larger pot doesn't necessarily lead to a proportionally higher gain for you.",
        "79": "Risk-Aversion: Since you have a relatively stable token count around 21, you might want to focus on preserving your tokens rather than taking risks by contributing more. This can help you reach your primary goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens.",
        "80": "Target Gains: Aim for a minimum gain of 1.5 to 2 tokens per round to steadily increase your token count without risking significant losses. This can be achieved by contributing 1 or 2 tokens, depending on the situation.",
        "81": "Maximizing Gain: Calculate the minimum contribution that would result in a gain that, when added to your current tokens, would maintain or increase your buffer. This will help you determine the optimal number of tokens to contribute.",
        "82": "Avoiding Greed: While maintaining a buffer is important, avoid being too conservative, as contributing nothing could result in a lower overall gain if the public pot multiplier is high.",
        "83": "Coordination (if possible): If you can communicate or infer any coordination among other players, adjust your contribution accordingly. If others are likely to contribute more, you might want to contribute less to benefit from their contributions.",
        "84": "Monitor Payoff Changes: Keep track of the difference in your gain between rounds. If the difference is consistently decreasing, it might indicate that the public pot is becoming less valuable due to more players contributing. In this case, consider reducing your contribution.",
        "85": "Maintain a Consistent Lead: Aim to contribute just enough to ensure the public pot multiplier (2) results in a net gain for you, without risking too much.",
        "86": "Protect Your Lead: If you accumulate more than 30 tokens before the end of the game, shift your strategy to a more conservative approach. Contribute just enough to maintain your lead without risking a significant loss.",
        "87": "Balance Individual and Collective Gain: Contribute in a way that benefits both the public good and your individual goal. If you can contribute to a pot that will multiply to a value that benefits everyone without significantly depleting your tokens, it could be a good strategy.",
        "88": "Avoid Last-Round Betting: In the final rounds, avoid making large contributions based on the assumption that others will follow. This can be risky, as others might not contribute as much, leaving you with a lower payoff.",
        "89": "Anticipate Changes: Players might adapt their strategies after Round 1, so be prepared for different levels of contribution. If you think others will increase their contributions, you might want to contribute less to avoid over-contributing. Conversely, if you expect a decrease, contributing more could be advantageous.",
        "90": "Balancing Risk and Reward: Since player_1's token count has been relatively stable around 21, it's crucial to balance the risk of contributing more tokens to the public pot with the potential reward. If the public pot is likely to multiply significantly, consider contributing more to capitalize on the higher payoff.",
        "91": "Adapt to Changes: Notice that in round 15, contributing 2 tokens did not result in a higher gain compared to previous rounds. This suggests that the other players might be adjusting their strategies as well. Be prepared to adapt your own strategy in response to these changes.",
        "92": "Targeted Contributions: Identify rounds where the public pot is likely to be larger due to other players' contributions. In these rounds, contributing more tokens could lead to a higher individual gain.",
        "93": "Equalizing Gains: If you see that other players are closing the gap in tokens, you might want to contribute more to maintain a comfortable lead, especially if you're close to the 30-token target.",
        "94": "Monitor Other Players' Contributions: Notice that other players' contributions are inconsistent. Keep track of their patterns to predict the potential size of the public pot. If others are contributing less, it might be more beneficial to contribute more to take advantage of the higher multiplier.",
        "95": "Public Pot Size: The public pot size has been relatively small, ranging from 6 to 9 tokens. This indicates that players are not contributing heavily, which could be due to the risk of sharing the multiplied value with others.",
        "96": "Goal for Round 12: Contribute 1 token to the public pot, anticipating that other players will also contribute conservatively due to the recent pattern of low contributions. Monitor the public pot size and adjust your strategy accordingly in the following rounds based on the actual contributions and the pot's multiplication factor.",
        "97": "Equalize Gains: Aim for a round where your gain is close to or equal to the average gain of other players if possible. This can help maintain a stable position in the game and avoid significant fluctuations in your token count.",
        "98": "Anticipate Others' Behavior: If you observe that other players are also adopting a more conservative approach, it might be wise to follow suit, as the public pot's size will likely be smaller, and contributing more could lead to lower individual gains.",
        "99": "Adapt to Increasing Returns: If you notice that the returns from the public pot are increasing, you can cautiously increase your contribution, but only to a level that still maintains your buffer.",
        "100": "Opportunistic Contributions: If you observe that other players are contributing significantly, contributing a moderate amount could lead to a higher public pot and a potentially larger return. However, be cautious not to over-contribute, as the public good is still divided equally.",
        "101": "Risk Assessment: You have a buffer of 8.8 tokens. You can afford to lose some tokens in a few rounds if it increases your chances of a higher gain in other rounds. However, be cautious not to lose your buffer entirely, as it provides a safety net against poor outcomes.",
        "102": "Risk Assessment: Since the game is nearing its end, you might need to take calculated risks. If you observe that others are contributing more, it might be beneficial to match or exceed their contributions to benefit from the multiplied public good. However, if others are not contributing significantly, avoid over-contributing.",
        "103": "Equalizing Strategy: If you notice that other players' token counts are converging, contributing just enough to maintain the status quo might be a good strategy to avoid becoming a target for other players' strategic moves.",
        "104": "Avoiding Overreliance: Don't solely rely on the public pot for your token accumulation. Focus on retaining and growing your private tokens, as they provide a more stable source of income.",
        "105": "Balance between Contribute and Retain: In each round, decide whether to contribute to the public pot or retain tokens. If the public pot's performance seems unpredictable, it might be safer to retain tokens to maintain your buffer.",
        "106": "Collaboration or Competition: Assess whether collaborating with other players (by coordinating contributions) or competing against them (by contributing less when they contribute more) would better serve your buffer goal.",
        "107": "Coordination and Cooperation: Attempting to coordinate with other players, either informally or through signaling, could be a sub-goal. If you can form a group that contributes consistently, you might create a situation where the public good is more valuable, benefiting all group members.",
        "108": "Learning from Past Rounds: Analyze the outcomes of your previous contributions. If contributing 2 tokens consistently results in a lower gain, shift to contributing 1 token more often.",
        "109": "Set a Personal Contribution Strategy: Given the trend, you might want to consider contributing 1 token more often, especially if you sense that others are likely to contribute less. This will help you maintain your token count while benefiting from the public pot.",
        "110": "Consider Contributing Less: Given the relatively low return on investment from the public good in Round 1, you might consider contributing fewer tokens in the next round, perhaps 1 or 2, to balance the risk and reward.",
        "111": "Consistency in Contributions: Notice that in Round 1, there were more contributions around the middle range (2 and 3 tokens), while in Round 2, contributions were more scattered. Keep track of whether players tend to maintain a consistent pattern or if they are more variable in their contributions.",
        "112": "Identify High and Low Contributors: In Round 1, players 3, 4, and 5 were the high contributors, while in Round 2, player 3 was the only high contributor. Identify these players and consider their potential influence on the public pot.",
        "113": "Match or Slightly Exceed the Average: A potential strategy could be to match or slightly exceed the average contribution of other players. This might help maximize your gain from the public pot without over-contributing. In Round 1, contributing 2 tokens was close to the average, while in Round 2, contributing 3 tokens was above the average.",
        "114": "Pot Multiplier Threshold: Determine a threshold for the public pot size that justifies your contribution. For example, if the pot is below 7 tokens, you might choose to contribute only 1 token, while if it's above 9 tokens, you might contribute 2 tokens.",
        "115": "Relative Position: Monitor your position compared to other players. If you're near the top, you might want to focus on maintaining your position rather than aggressively accumulating more tokens. If you're lagging behind, you might need to take more risks by contributing more tokens.",
        "116": "Predictive Modeling: Try to predict future contributions based on past behavior. If you observe a pattern, adjust your contribution accordingly. For instance, if players tend to contribute less as the game progresses, you might want to contribute more in the earlier rounds.",

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Pot Multiplication Factor: Aim to contribute when the total contribution from others is likely to result in a higher multiplication factor, as this will lead to a more significant payoff.\n - Target Tokens: Calculate the number of tokens needed to reach the goal. Currently have 21.6 tokens, so need at least 8.4 more tokens to reach 30 by the end of the game.\n - Coordination or Competition: If there's any indication that other players are coordinating, either adapt to their strategy or try to create a competitive situation by contributing differently to disrupt their coordination.\n - Final Push: In the last round, you might want to consider a slightly higher contribution if you believe others will also contribute more, as the multiplier effect could lead to a larger gain. However, if you think others will contribute less, maintain a conservative approach to secure your current token count.\n - Risk Assessment: Since you are close to the target, you may want to be more cautious with your contributions. The risk of over-contributing and not reaching the 30-token threshold is higher now.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

        "54": "Balance Gains: Aim for a balance between gaining tokens through the public pot and retaining tokens in your private collection. Consider the number of rounds remaining and the target of accumulating more than 30 tokens.",
        "55": "Average Contribution: The average contribution per player seems to be fluctuating between 1 and 3 tokens. This suggests that there is no clear pattern or consistent behavior among the other players.",
        "56": "Consistent Gains: Aim for an average gain of 0.9 tokens per round in the remaining rounds. This would allow you to reach 29.2 tokens, which is just shy of your goal but still within reach with a single well-timed contribution.",
        "57": "Take Advantage of High Contributions: When other players contribute more, it might be beneficial to contribute more tokens as well, to capitalize on the higher multiplier. For example, in Round 2, contributing 1 token when others contributed more might have resulted in a lower gain than if you had contributed more.",
        "58": "Information Gathering: Keep track of the average contribution per round and the average public pot size. This information can help you predict potential gains and adjust your strategy accordingly.",

        "60": "Endgame Strategy: Become more conservative with your contributions as the game progresses to ensure you meet your reserve goal and have a chance to accumulate more tokens in the remaining rounds.",
        "61": "Consistency in Others' Contributions: Be cautious about contributing too much, as the public pot might not consistently multiply to a high enough value to justify a large contribution.",
        "62": "Targeting Moderate Contributions: Consider contributing 2 tokens, as it's slightly above the average without being too high. This could potentially take advantage of the multiplier while minimizing the risk of over-contributing.",
        "63": "Monitoring Personal Tokens: Keep a target for the number of tokens player_2 wants to have after each round, ensuring a safety net against potential low returns from the public pot. For instance, aim to have at least 23 tokens after the next round to maintain a buffer.",
        "64": "Avoid Being a Freerider: If you consistently contribute less than others, they might adjust their strategies, leading to lower multipliers. Contribute enough to maintain a fair share of the public good without being a burden.",
        "65": "Maintain Token Count: Your primary goal should be to maintain or slightly increase your token count while staying above the 30-token threshold.",
        "66": "Risk Management: Be cautious with your contributions, especially in rounds where the public pot is expected to be small.",
        "67": "Endgame Strategy: Be more assertive in contributing as the game nears its end, but balance this with the risk of over-contributing and losing tokens.",

        "73": "Other Players' Contributions: Observe the pattern of other players' contributions. If they tend to contribute more, it might be beneficial to contribute as well. If they contribute less, consider retaining tokens for personal gain.",
        "74": "Equal or Near-Equal Tokens: Notice the token distribution among players is quite close. Be cautious of rounds where others might be trying to catch up, as they might contribute more, and you might need to adjust your strategy accordingly.",
        "75": "Estimate Public Pot: Based on the average contribution, you can estimate the potential size of the public pot in the next round. If the trend continues, the average contribution might decrease, leading to a smaller public pot.",
        "76": "Adapt Strategy: If the trend of decreasing contributions persists, you might want to shift your strategy towards retaining more tokens for personal gain, especially if you're close to your target of 30 tokens.",
        "77": "Monitor Your Position: Keep track of your token count relative to other players. If you're ahead, you might be more willing to take risks, while if you're behind, you might need to be more aggressive in contributing.",
        "78": "Set a Threshold for Contribution: Consider setting a personal threshold for contributing tokens. For example, if the total contribution from others is below a certain level, contribute minimally or not at all to avoid diluting your potential gain.",

        "81": "Low Contribution Threshold for Benefit: In rounds where the public pot is smaller (e.g., Round 3 and Round 5), contributing more tokens did not result in a proportionally higher gain. This suggests that a lower threshold of contribution might be more beneficial, especially when others are contributing less.",
        "82": "Equalizing Tokens: In some rounds, the token distribution among players seems to be converging (e.g., after Round 2 and Round 6). This could indicate a desire for fairness or a strategic attempt to balance power among players. You might consider contributing just enough to maintain this balance or exploit imbalances if they arise.",
        "83": "Risk-Aversion: Players seem to be cautious with their contributions, with no player consistently contributing the maximum (5 tokens). This suggests a risk-averse approach. You might adopt a similar strategy, contributing just enough to benefit from the public good without risking too much.",
        "84": "Anticipating Others' Adjustments: As the game progresses, players might adapt their strategies. Monitor their behavior and adjust your own accordingly. If others start contributing more, consider doing the same to maximize the public good's multiplication effect.",
        "85": "Optimal Contribution: Determine the optimal number of tokens to contribute in Round 3. Given the previous rounds, you might consider contributing 2 tokens, as it's a middle ground between Round 1 and Round 2 contributions, and it could potentially lead to a balanced gain.",
        "86": "Estimate the Average: Before contributing, try to predict the average contribution for the current round based on previous trends. If the average is likely to be around 2 tokens, aim to contribute 2 or slightly more to benefit from the multiplier.",
        "87": "Risk Assessment: Since the multiplier is 2, contributing just above the average can be beneficial, but it's also risky if others contribute significantly less. Weigh the potential gain against the possibility of a lower public pot.",
        "88": "Consistency: Maintaining a consistent contribution pattern might help you predict the public pot's size and other players' behavior. If you notice a trend in your own or others' contributions, try to align with it.",
        "89": "Risk Assessment: Since you are close to the target, you might want to be more risk-averse. This means contributing less when the public pot is likely to be small or when other players are contributing more.",
        "90": "Anticipate Others' Strategies: If other players are also trying to maintain a buffer, they might also be contributing less. Be prepared for rounds with lower total contributions, which could result in a higher individual gain from a smaller public pot.",

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Endgame Strategy: Focus on accumulating tokens without risking a significant loss. Consider contributing just enough to ensure a small but consistent gain, rather than attempting to make a large one in a single round.\n - Optimal Contribution: Since the public pot is multiplied by 2, a lower average contribution from others could mean a smaller potential public good. You might want to consider contributing less in anticipation of a smaller pot, but be cautious, as a sudden increase in others' contributions could lead to regret if you've contributed too little.\n - Player Behavior Analysis: Observe the contribution patterns of other players and try to identify any patterns or strategies that other players might be following.\n - Equalize Gains: When the tokens of other players are close to player_3's, it might be beneficial to maintain the status quo rather than trying to outperform. This can be achieved by contributing the same amount as the average contribution of others.\n - Diversify Strategy: Vary your contributions based on the game's dynamics, the behavior of other players, and the current public pot size.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

This could involve contributing more than the average to create a larger public good, hoping others will follow suit.",
        "76": "Track Individual Gains: Your gains have been mostly around 1.2 to 1.8 tokens per round. To accumulate more tokens, you need to find opportunities to increase this gain. This could involve contributing more when the pot is likely to be larger or contributing less when others are contributing more.",
        "77": "Maintain a Consistent Token Reserve: Player_3 should aim to maintain a buffer of at least 9 tokens (30 - current tokens) to reach the goal. This means they should avoid contributing too many tokens in a single round, risking falling below this safety net.",

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Avoid Over-contributing: Given the variability in contributions, it's crucial not to over-contribute when others are contributing less. This can lead to a lower individual gain, as the public good payoff will be divided among more tokens.\n - Target Pot Size: Since a larger pot size (9 tokens) has resulted in a higher gain for Player_4 in the past, it might be beneficial to contribute more if the pot is expected to be large. However, with only one round left, it's crucial to weigh the potential gain against the risk of losing tokens.\n - Risk Management: Prioritize retaining tokens over contributing to the public pot. Contribute minimally or not at all, unless there's a clear indication that a high contribution from others will result in a substantial payoff.\n - Adaptive Strategy: If the pot size consistently falls within the target range without your contribution, consider contributing less or not at all to preserve your tokens. Conversely, if the pot size consistently falls below the target range, increase your contribution to capitalize on the multiplier.\n - Track Contribution Shifts: Observe if players are consistently increasing, decreasing, or alternating their contributions. In this case, player_1 and player_3 decreased their contributions, while player_2 remained constant. Player_4 and player_5 also decreased their contributions in Round 2.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

        "73": "Maintain Token Count: A primary goal could be to maintain or slightly increase your token count without risking a significant loss.",
        "74": "Balance between Public and Private: Focus more on retaining tokens for your private collection. This could mean contributing 1 token or abstaining from contributing in the next round.",
        "75": "Monitor Contribution Trends: Keep track of the number of tokens other players are contributing. If you notice a pattern of higher contributions, especially from a single player, consider matching or exceeding that contribution to benefit from the larger public pot.",

        "77": "Consistency: Maintain a consistent contribution pattern that is neither too high nor too low. This can help avoid drawing attention to yourself while still benefiting from the public pot.",
        "78": "Avoid Extreme Contributions: Avoid contributing the maximum or minimum tokens in a round, as this could signal a specific strategy, making you a target for other players.",
        "79": "Coordination or Competition: If possible, try to gauge if there's any coordination among other players. If they are working together, consider increasing your contribution to benefit from their collective action. If they are competing, maintain a more individualistic strategy.",
        "80": "Predicting Others' Next Move: If you notice a trend in other players' contributions, try to predict their next move. For example, if they alternate between 1 and 2 tokens, you might want to do the same or contribute slightly more to take advantage of their higher contribution in the previous round.",
        "81": "Target high multipliers: Since you need a higher return, aim to contribute more when you anticipate that others will also contribute more, creating a larger public pot. This could be when you see a pattern of increasing contributions or if you can coordinate with other players.",
        "82": "Maintain a stable token balance: You have been hovering around 21 tokens, which is close to your initial balance. Aim to maintain or slightly increase this balance without taking too much risk.",
        "83": "Expect More Low Contributions: Given the recent trend, it's reasonable to anticipate that more players might continue contributing 1 token.",
        "84": "Watch for Changes: Since there is no clear pattern, be prepared for a change in behavior. If a player has consistently contributed less, they might increase their contribution to exploit the public good.",
        "85": "Consider Your Own Strategy: Your recent contributions have also been inconsistent, so consider how your choice might influence others. If you contribute more, others might follow to take advantage of the larger pot, or they might contribute less to benefit from your generosity.",
        "86": "Avoid over-contributing: When the public pot is small (as in rounds 9, 10, 11, and 12), contributing more tokens might not result in a significant gain. Stick to contributing 1 or 2 tokens to minimize potential losses.",
        "87": "Consider the impact on others: Your decisions may influence other players' strategies. If you think others might be observing your behavior, mix up your contributions to avoid being predictable.",
        "88": "Consistency: If you notice that other players are consistently contributing low amounts, it might be beneficial to follow their lead and contribute minimally, as the multiplier will likely be low.",
        "89": "Endgame burst: If you're still short of your goal in the final rounds, you might consider making a larger contribution in the hope of a high multiplier. However, this should be balanced with the risk of over-contributing if others don't follow suit.",
        "90": "Set a Threshold: Determine a threshold for the number of tokens you're willing to contribute in Round 6. For example, if the pot size is less than 10 tokens, you might choose to contribute only 1 token to minimize risk. If the pot size is larger, you might consider contributing more to take advantage of the multiplier.",
        "91": "Monitor Others' Tokens: Keep track of the tokens other players have. If they are also close to the target, they might become more aggressive, and you should adjust your strategy accordingly.",
        "92": "Game Progress: With only 10 rounds played out of 20, you still have time to accumulate tokens. However, as the game progresses, the risk of contributing to the public pot might increase, especially if other players start contributing more.",
        "93": "Avoid Sudden Changes: Sudden increases in your contribution might signal to other players that you're desperate to reach the target. Try to maintain a consistent but strategic approach to avoid becoming a target for exploitation.",
        "94": "Coordination or Prediction: Try to predict other players' behavior. If you observe a pattern, such as players alternating between low and high contributions, you can adjust your strategy accordingly. If possible, coordinate with other players to create a round where everyone contributes more, maximizing the public pot's value.",
        "95": "Target Optimal Contribution: Given that the public pot has been around 7-10 tokens in recent rounds, contributing 2 tokens seems to result in a gain of around 2 tokens. Player_4 could aim for a slightly higher contribution (e.g., 2.5 tokens) if they believe it will result in a higher multiplier due to others' contributions.",

Player_1 reduced their contribution to 1 token, and player_3 reduced it to 2 tokens. This suggests that players might be experimenting with different contribution levels.",
        "98": "Track Contribution Shifts: Observe if players are consistently increasing, decreasing, or alternating their contributions. In this case, player_1 and player_3 decreased their contributions, while player_2 remained constant. Player_4 and player_5 also decreased their contributions in Round 2.",
        "99": "Maintain or Decrease Contributions: Given the decreasing trend, it might be wise to maintain your current level of contribution (1 token) or even decrease it slightly, as the public good's value seems to be diminishing with lower contributions.",

If you believe that a higher total contribution would lead to a better public good payoff, contribute slightly more to encourage others to do the same. If not, stick to a lower contribution to protect your tokens.",
        "106": "Maintain a Consistent Position: A conservative strategy might be appropriate to maintain your position and avoid making risky moves that could lead to a loss.",
        "107": "Conservative Approach: Given that you are close to your safety net target, a conservative strategy might be to contribute minimally in the remaining rounds. This would allow you to retain more tokens in your private collection and minimize the risk of losing tokens due to the public pot's distribution.",

        "111": "Target higher multipliers: If you can predict that the next round might have a higher multiplier (e.g., due to a rule change or a pattern in player behavior), it might be worth contributing more tokens to capitalize on the increased public good payoff.",
        "112": "Avoid being a free-rider: If you consistently contribute less than others, they might adjust their strategies, leading to a lower multiplier. Keep an eye on the group dynamics and contribute enough to maintain a fair balance.",
        "113": "Consistency: Maintain a consistent strategy to avoid signaling your intentions to other players. If you suddenly contribute more, others might follow suit, reducing the benefit for you.",

        "115": "Late-Game Aggressiveness: As the game progresses, you might want to become more aggressive in your contribution strategy, especially in the last 5-6 rounds. This could involve contributing more tokens when you perceive that others are contributing less, to take advantage of the multiplier effect.",
        "116": "Target Rounds for Increased Contribution: Identify rounds where the public pot is likely to be larger due to higher contributions. In these rounds, you might contribute more to capitalize on the potential high-value public good.",
        "117": "Predicting Others' Behavior: Try to anticipate how other players might respond to your increased contributions. If you think they might follow suit, it might be best to maintain your current strategy to avoid a potential 'race to the bottom' where everyone contributes heavily, diluting the public good's value.",
        "118": "Monitor Contribution Trends: Keep track of the average contribution per round and the public pot size. If you notice a consistent decline, be prepared for a potential increase in the next round.",
        "119": "Balance Short-Term and Long-Term Gains: Consider the long-term implications of your decisions. While it might be tempting to conserve tokens for a potential reversal, you also need to ensure that you're accumulating enough tokens to meet your primary goal.",

        "121": "Monitor Public Pot Size: Observe the size of the public pot and adjust contributions accordingly. If the pot is small, contributing less might be more beneficial, as the multiplier (2) might not result in a significant increase in the public good.",
        "122": "Track Other Players' Patterns: Notice that other players are also contributing 1 or 2 tokens. This suggests a cautious approach is prevalent. Keep an eye on any changes in their behavior and adapt yours if necessary.",
        "123": "Risk Assessment: Since you're close to the target, minimize risk by not contributing too many tokens in a single round. A balanced approach is safer, especially if you notice other players are also close to their targets.",
        "124": "Coordination: If possible, attempt to coordinate with other players, even if it's informal. This could involve contributing the same amount as another player or contributing more when others are expected to do the same.",
        "125": "Buffer: Maintain a small buffer of tokens to protect against potential low returns in the last few rounds. This could mean contributing slightly less than the average needed to reach the target.",
        "126": "Balance Risk and Reward: Weigh the potential gain from the public good against the tokens you're contributing. If the gain is not significantly higher than the tokens contributed, it might be better to retain more tokens for personal collection.",
        "127": "Risk Assessment: Player_4 currently has 21.8 tokens, and their goal is to accumulate more than 30 tokens. They can afford to take a slightly higher risk in the next round by contributing more tokens if they believe it could lead to a larger public pot and a higher individual gain. However, they should also consider the potential loss if the pot doesn't perform as expected.",
        "128": "Endgame Strategy: With only a few rounds left, player_4 should start considering their endgame strategy. If they believe that the remaining rounds will have similar patterns, they might want to contribute slightly more to catch up with their target. However, if they think that other players will become more risk-averse, they should adjust their strategy accordingly.",
        "129": "Coordination: Although there's no direct communication, try to infer if other players are coordinating their contributions. If you notice a pattern, you can adjust your strategy accordingly.",
        "130": "Predicting Shifts: Consider if players might adjust their strategies based on the previous round's results. If they realize that contributing less could be more beneficial, they might contribute less, which could prompt you to contribute more to maintain the balance.",

        "132": "Contribution Threshold: Determine a threshold for the average contribution above which you will contribute less and below which you will contribute more. For example, if the average contribution falls below 2 tokens, you might consider contributing more to take advantage of the multiplier.",

        "134": "Consistency: Notice that your token count has been relatively stable around 22 tokens. To accumulate more than 30 tokens, you need to start contributing more strategically to capitalize on larger pots or when you predict that others will contribute more.",
        "135": "Pot Size Threshold: From the data, it seems that pots above 8-10 tokens have resulted in lower marginal gains. However, it's not clear if this is a consistent pattern. To establish a more accurate threshold, you could analyze the previous rounds' data to find the point where the marginal gain per token contributed starts to decline significantly.",
        "136": "Player Behavior Observation: Keep track of other players' contributions to predict the pot size. If others are also adopting a similar threshold strategy, the threshold might shift, and you'll need to adjust accordingly.",

        "138": "Risk Assessment: Analyze the average contribution of other players. If they tend to contribute more tokens, it might be safer to contribute less to avoid a significant loss. Conversely, if they contribute less, contributing more could lead to a higher individual gain.",
        "139": "Target Gains: In each round, aim for a gain that keeps you above the 20-token threshold. For example, if you have 21 tokens, a gain of 1 token would be enough to maintain the buffer.",
        "140": "Late-Game Strategy: As the game progresses, the risk of falling below the threshold increases. Towards the end, you might want to be more conservative with your contributions, especially if you're close to the threshold.",
        "141": "Learning from Past Rounds: Observe the relationship between the number of tokens contributed and the public pot multiplication. If contributing more tokens consistently leads to a lower individual gain, it might be better to focus on retaining tokens.",
        "142": "Identify Consistency: Notice that player_1 and player_3 have consistently contributed the least, while player_2 has contributed more in some rounds. Players_4 and _5 have shown a mix of contributions. Keep track of these patterns to predict future contributions.",
        "143": "Predict Public Pot Size: Based on the past rounds, the public pot size has ranged from 7 to 13 tokens. Estimate the potential pot size for the next round by considering the average contribution and adjust your contribution accordingly.",
        "144": "Coordination (if possible): If there's an opportunity to communicate or infer cooperation with other players, try to coordinate with those who also seem to be following a risk-averse strategy. This could lead to a more stable and predictable game environment.",
        "145": "Evaluate Risk-Taking: In Round 4, when you contributed 2 tokens, the public pot was only slightly larger than in Round 3, but your gain was lower. This indicates that players might be more risk-averse, contributing just enough to benefit from the public good without over-contributing.",
        "146": "Predict Future Contributions: Given the observed pattern, it's reasonable to expect that players might continue contributing around 1-2 tokens in the next round. However, be prepared for potential changes if players start to adapt their strategies.",

        "153": "Coordination and Cooperation: Attempting to coordinate with other players, either informally or through signaling, could be a sub-goal. If you can form a group that contributes consistently, you might create a situation where the public good is more valuable, benefiting all group members.",
        "154": "Set a Round Target: Given your starting tokens and the goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens, you might set a target for each round. For example, you might aim to end each round with at least 22 tokens to ensure a buffer for potential losses in future rounds.",
