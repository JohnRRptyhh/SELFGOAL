In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Retain Enough Tokens: Ensure that you retain enough tokens to reach your primary goal. If your token count dips below what is necessary to reach 30 tokens, consider reducing your contributions to the public pot and prioritizing your own token accumulation.\n - Analyze Other Players' Contributions: Pay attention to the contributions of other players and adjust your strategy accordingly. If other players are contributing more or less than you, consider adjusting your contributions to remain competitive.\n - Avoid Over-Contributing: While contributing more tokens than the leaders may help you gain more tokens in the short term, it may also deplete your token count and make it harder to reach your long-term goal. Be mindful of your token count and avoid over-contributing.\n - Stay Persistent: Don't give up on your goal, even if you experience setbacks. Stay persistent and continue to adjust your strategy as needed to reach your goal.\n - Set a Gradual Increase or Decrease: Decide on a gradual increase or decrease in your contribution rate. For example, if you have been contributing 7 tokens per round, consider contributing 6 or 8 tokens in the next round instead.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Adapt to changing contributions: Be prepared to adjust your contribution level if the average contribution changes over time. Stay flexible and be ready to adapt to new situations.\n - Analyze the current standings: You are currently in second place with 26.6 tokens, only 0.6 tokens behind the leader. This suggests that you are in a strong position and should focus on protecting your lead rather than taking significant risks to catch up.\n - Maintain a consistent contribution level: To avoid drawing attention to yourself and potentially becoming a target for other players, consider maintaining a consistent contribution level. This can help you blend in with the other players and avoid being singled out as a threat.\n - Avoid Large Swings in Contributions: Try to avoid making large swings in your contributions from one round to the next. This can make it difficult to predict how many tokens you will have in your private collection and can leave you vulnerable to other players who are contributing more consistently.\n - Maintain a safe distance from 30 tokens: With 27.6 tokens, you are close to reaching your primary objective. To secure your position, consider contributing fewer tokens to the public pot to minimize the risk of falling below 30 tokens if the public pot's return is low.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Adjust your contributions based on the game stage: As the game progresses, consider contributing more to the public pot to increase your overall payoff and catch up to other players who may have a higher token count. However, be mindful of the minimum token threshold and avoid contributing too much too early in the game.\n - Adjust Contributions: Adjust your contributions to match those of your potential allies, while still keeping in mind your overall goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens by the end of the game. This can help build trust and encourage reciprocation from your potential allies.\n - Identify Consistent Contributors: Players 1 and 4 have consistently contributed higher numbers of tokens, with an average contribution of 7 tokens per round. Keep a close eye on their contributions and adjust your strategy accordingly.\n - Balance contributions and retention: Aim to contribute enough tokens to stay competitive, but also retain enough tokens to remain a viable contender. A good balance might be to contribute slightly less than the player in third place and slightly more than the player in fifth place.\n - Communicate and Coordinate: Initiate communication with potential allies to discuss strategies and coordinate contributions to the public pot. This could involve agreeing to contribute a certain number of tokens in each round or adjusting contributions based on the actions of players 1 and 3.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

        "83": "Evaluate Success: Regularly evaluate the success of the alliance by comparing your token balance and gains to those of other players. If the alliance is not providing sufficient benefits, consider finding new allies or adjusting your strategy.",
        "84": "Monitor your position relative to other players: Keep track of your token balance and contribution level relative to other players. If you find yourself falling behind, consider adjusting your strategy to prioritize maintaining a positive balance over maximizing gains.",
        "85": "Be prepared to adjust your strategy: Be flexible and willing to adjust your strategy as needed based on the actions of other players and the state of the game. This can help ensure that you maintain a positive balance while also maximizing gains.",
        "86": "Stay vigilant: Keep a close eye on your token balance and adjust your strategy as needed to ensure that you maintain a positive balance after each round.",
        "87": "Analyze Gains: Review your gains from the public pot in each round. In the current game, you have received a high payoff from the public pot in rounds 1, 4, and 7 (6.0, 6.2, and 8.2, respectively).",
        "88": "Identify Contribution Patterns: Examine your contribution patterns in relation to your gains. In rounds 1, 4, and 7, you contributed 8, 5, and 5 tokens to the public pot, respectively. These contributions were lower than in rounds 2, 3, 5, and 6, where you contributed 7, 10, 6, and 7 tokens, respectively.",
        "89": "Monitor Other Players' Balances: Keep an eye on the token balances of other players. If a player is close to being eliminated due to a negative balance, consider reducing your contributions to the public pot to avoid being eliminated yourself.",

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Analyze the contributions of other players: Look at the contributions of the other players in the previous rounds and identify the lowest contributors. This will give you an idea of who you need to outperform in the current round.\n - Set a minimum contribution threshold: Based on the lowest contributors in the previous rounds, set a minimum contribution threshold for yourself to ensure that you don't end up being the lowest contributor.\n - Monitor the game progress: Keep track of the game progress and adjust your strategy accordingly. If you find that you are consistently being outperformed by other players, consider adjusting your contribution strategy to increase your chances of success.\n - Stay Informed: Continuously gather information about the actions of other players and adjust your strategy accordingly. Staying informed and responsive to changing conditions is key to success in this game.\n - Identify potential alliances: Look for patterns in player_2's contributions that suggest they may be forming alliances with other players.

          "content": "\n\nYou are participating in a game played by 5 players over 35 rounds.\n\nGame Rules:\n\n1. In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Maintain competitiveness: While it's essential to avoid over-investing in the public pot, ensure that your token count remains competitive with other players. If your token count falls significantly below the average, consider adjusting your strategy to increase your token accumulation.\n - Maintain a balance between personal gain and public pot contributions: While reducing contributions can improve your gain-to-contribution ratio, contributing too little may lead to free-riding behavior.\n - Analyze Payoff Multiplier Patterns: Pay attention to the pattern of payoff multipliers in previous rounds. If you notice a trend of higher multipliers in certain rounds, consider contributing a larger number of tokens in those rounds to maximize your gain-to-contribution ratio.\n - Identify High Ratio Players: First, identify the players with the highest token-to-contribution ratios. In this case, players 1 and 2 have consistently high ratios, indicating they may be employing successful strategies.\n - Monitor Contribution Fluctuations: Keep track of players whose contribution patterns fluctuate significantly. For example, player_2's contributions range from 5 to 10 tokens, indicating a less consistent strategy.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

        "164": "Long-Term Thinking: Keep in mind the long-term objective of accumulating more than 30 tokens by the end of the game. Avoid short-term thinking that prioritizes immediate gains over long-term success.",
        "165": "Identify dominant players: Consider monitoring the contributions of Players 2 and 3 closely to determine if they consistently contribute high numbers of tokens, prioritizing the public good payoff over their private collections.",
        "166": "Identify consistent contributors: Monitor the contributions of Players 1, 3, and 4 in future rounds to determine if they maintain consistent contributions, and consider forming alliances or adjusting your strategy accordingly.",
        "167": "Identify potential free-riders: Monitor the contributions of Player 5 in future rounds to counteract their free-riding behavior if they consistently contribute low numbers of tokens.",
        "168": "Monitor token distribution: Note the distribution of tokens among players after Round 1 to anticipate future contributions based on players' token counts.",
        "169": "Analyze the multiplier effect: Monitor the impact of the multiplier effect in future rounds to determine if it consistently benefits players who contribute more tokens to the public pot.",
        "170": "Identify contribution trends: Look for any trends in contribution patterns. For example, players 1 and 2 may have a tendency to contribute similar amounts, while players 4 and 5 may be more generous contributors.",
        "171": "Consider the public pot: Note the total number of tokens in the public pot in Round 1 (35 tokens). Also, observe how the public pot amount relates to individual contributions. For example, players 4 and 5, who contributed the most, received the highest gains (8.0 and 7.0 tokens, respectively).",
        "172": "Consider the potential for reciprocity: Note that players 1 and 2 contributed similar amounts in Round 1. Consider whether contributing similar amounts in future rounds could encourage reciprocity and potentially lead to higher gains.",
        "173": "Evaluate the risk of higher contributions: Note that players 4 and 5 contributed the most in Round 1 and received the highest gains. However, consider the risk of contributing higher amounts in future rounds, as this could result in lower gains if other players contribute lower amounts.",
        "174": "Monitor the contributions of other players: Continue to monitor the contribution patterns of other players in future rounds. Adjust your own contribution strategy as needed based on your observations.",
        "175": "Monitor changes in strategy: Keep track of any changes in each player's strategy over the course of the game to gain valuable insights into their decision-making process.",
        "176": "Identify potential alliances: Consider forming alliances with other players who share similar goals or strategies, involving coordinating contributions to the public pot or sharing information about other players' behavior.",
        "177": "Monitor your own performance: Keep track of your own token count and contributions to the public pot to determine if your strategy is effective in achieving your goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens by the end of the game.",
