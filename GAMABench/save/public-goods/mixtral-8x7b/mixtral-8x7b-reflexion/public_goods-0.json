          "content": "\n\nYou are participating in a game played by 5 players over 40 rounds.\n\nGame Rules:\n\n1. In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for failure is that I did not contribute any tokens to the public pot in round 1, while other players contributed tokens which led to a higher public good payoff that was divided evenly among all players. This resulted in me receiving a lower individual payoff compared to players who contributed tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing tokens to the public pot in future rounds. This will increase the total tokens in the pot, leading to a higher public good payoff and a larger share of that payoff for me. However, I will also need to balance this with retaining enough tokens in my private collection to ensure that I have a sufficient amount for future rounds. Therefore, my high-level plan is to contribute a moderate number of tokens to the public pot in each round, taking into account the contributions of the other players and adjusting my own contribution accordingly to maximize my individual payoff.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for failure is that I may not be contributing enough tokens to the public pot. In the first round, I contributed 0 tokens while other players contributed 3, 6, 3, and 0 tokens, resulting in a lower public pot and a lower gain for me. In the second round, I contributed 5 tokens, which was still lower than the 5 or 10 tokens contributed by other players. This may have led to a lower public pot and a lower gain for me compared to some of the other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan to contribute more tokens to the public pot in future rounds. I will aim to contribute a higher number of tokens that is more in line with the contributions of the other players, in order to increase the size of the public pot and maximize my gain. I will also consider the contributions of the other players and adjust my own contributions accordingly, in order to ensure that I am not contributing significantly more or less than the other players. This will help to ensure that I am able to maximize my gains in the game while also contributing fairly to the public pot.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for failure is that I am contributing a fixed amount of tokens to the public pot in each round, regardless of the other players' contributions. This strategy may not be optimal because it does not take into account the fact that the public good payoff is evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution. Therefore, if other players contribute more tokens to the public pot, I could potentially gain more by contributing less and benefiting from their contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves adjusting my contribution based on the average contribution of the other players. Specifically, I will calculate the average contribution of the other players in each round and then contribute a percentage of that average. This will allow me to benefit from the other players' contributions while still making a meaningful contribution to the public pot. Additionally, I will also consider the total number of tokens I have and the total number of rounds in the game to ensure that I am not contributing too many tokens too early in the game and running out later on.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have been consistently high, even when other players have contributed less. While this has resulted in a reasonable gain for me in the short term, it has also led to a gradual decrease in my private tokens over time. This is because I am not retaining enough tokens for myself, and am relying too heavily on the public good payoff. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing less to the public pot when other players are contributing significantly less, in order to preserve my private tokens and ensure a more sustainable strategy in the long term.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have generally been in line with those of the other players, resulting in a reasonable share of the public good payoff. However, my token count has been gradually decreasing over time, which suggests that I may be contributing too many tokens relative to the gains I am receiving. To mitigate this, I will aim to contribute fewer tokens to the public pot while still maintaining a level of contribution that is roughly equivalent to the other players, in order to maximize my overall token count. This will require careful observation of the other players' contributions and adjustment of my own strategy as needed.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for a suboptimal performance is that I am contributing a fixed amount of tokens in each round, regardless of the other players' contributions. This strategy may not be maximizing my gains, as I am not taking into account the behavior of the other players and the total amount of tokens they are contributing to the public pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves adapting my contribution based on the total contributions of the other players. Specifically, I will aim to contribute a percentage of my current tokens that is proportional to the average contribution of the other players, in order to maximize my gains while still maintaining a sufficient number of tokens for future rounds. This strategy should allow me to better adapt to the behavior of the other players and increase my overall payoff.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a consistent number of tokens in each round, regardless of the actions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may be leading to suboptimal outcomes. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the actions of the other players and adjusts my contribution accordingly. I will aim to contribute more tokens when other players are contributing more, in order to maximize the public good payoff and ensure that I receive a larger share of this payoff. Additionally, I will aim to retain a sufficient number of tokens in my private collection to ensure that I do not fall behind the other players in terms of total tokens.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have generally been lower than those of some of the other players. This could be a reason for my relative failure in the game, as the public good payoff is divided evenly among all players, regardless of their individual contribution. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing more tokens to the public pot, with the goal of increasing the public good payoff and thus my own earnings. I will aim to balance this with retaining enough tokens in my private collection to ensure that I do not fall too far behind the other players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have generally been lower than those of some of the other players. This could be a reason for my failure to accumulate as many tokens as the other players. In order to mitigate this, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing a higher number of tokens to the public pot, with the goal of increasing the public good payoff and thus my share of it. I will also monitor the contributions of the other players and adjust my strategy as needed to ensure that I am not contributing significantly more than they are.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have generally been in line with those of the other players, resulting in a reasonable distribution of tokens among all participants. However, my token count has been gradually decreasing over time, which suggests that I may not be retaining enough tokens for myself. To mitigate this, I will aim to contribute less to the public pot in order to increase my own token count, while still maintaining a contribution level that is roughly equivalent to the other players. This should allow me to accumulate more tokens over time while still benefiting from the public good payoff.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot in each round, but other players are contributing varying amounts, which sometimes results in higher payoffs for them. This inconsistency in my strategy may be contributing to a lower overall payoff for me compared to some of the other players. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan to adjust my contributions based on the average contribution of the other players, with the goal of maximizing my overall payoff while still contributing to the public good. This will involve analyzing the contributions of the other players in each round and adjusting my own contribution accordingly, with the aim of finding a balance between maximizing my own payoff and contributing to the collective good.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot in each round, regardless of the actions of the other players. This could be a reason for failure, as it does not take into account the varying contributions of the other players and the resulting public pot size. To mitigate this, I will devise a new plan that considers the range of tokens contributed by the other players and adjusts my own contribution accordingly, aiming to maximize my individual gain while also contributing to the growth of the public pot. This will involve analyzing the average and standard deviation of tokens contributed by the other players, and adjusting my contribution to be slightly above the average if the standard deviation is high, indicating varied contributions. If the standard deviation is low, I will contribute an amount closer to the average to avoid losing out on potential gain.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively consistent, ranging from 3 to 7 per round. However, my token count has been gradually decreasing due to the fact that my contributions are often lower than the average contribution of other players, especially those contributing 10 or 11 tokens. This has resulted in my gains being outweighed by the growth in tokens of other players who contribute more.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to contribute tokens more strategically by analyzing the average contribution of other players and adjusting my contribution accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to contribute at or slightly above the average contribution of other players, while still retaining enough tokens to ensure that I do not fall too far behind in terms of overall token count. This will help me to maintain a more stable token count while also maximizing my gains from the public pot.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a consistent number of tokens in each round, regardless of the actions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may be leading to suboptimal outcomes. To mitigate this failure, I will develop a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of the other players. This could involve contributing more tokens when others are contributing less, in order to maximize my own gain while still promoting the public good. I will also consider contributing fewer tokens when others are contributing more, to avoid over-investing in the public pot. Overall, my new plan is to be more responsive to the actions of the other players, in order to achieve better outcomes in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistently high number of tokens to the public pot, which has resulted in a respectable collective gain but has not significantly increased my individual token count. This is likely because the public good payoff is evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution. To mitigate this, I need to adjust my strategy to prioritize my individual gain while still contributing enough tokens to remain competitive and benefit from the public good payoff. A possible high-level plan would be to contribute the minimum number of tokens required to maintain a steady increase in my individual token count, while keeping an eye on the contributions of other players and adjusting my strategy as needed.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively consistent, ranging from 3 to 8 tokens per round. However, my token count has been gradually decreasing due to the fact that the total contributions of the other players often exceed mine, resulting in a lower public pot multiplier and subsequently a lower individual gain. To mitigate this, I should aim to contribute tokens in a way that maximizes my individual gain while also considering the potential contributions of the other players. I could do this by adapting my strategy to the actions of the other players, aiming to contribute a slightly higher number of tokens when the other players' contributions are lower, and a slightly lower number of tokens when the other players' contributions are higher. This should help to maintain a more stable token count over time.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively consistent, ranging from 3 to 15 tokens per round. However, my token count has been decreasing over time, suggesting that my contributions may be too high compared to the other players. This could be due to a misunderstanding of the game's dynamics or an overestimation of the benefit of increasing the public pot. To mitigate this, I will aim to contribute fewer tokens, ideally matching or slightly exceeding the median contribution of the other players, in order to maintain a steady increase in my token count while still contributing to the public pot.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively consistent, ranging from 3 to 15 tokens per round. However, my token count has been decreasing over time, suggesting that I may be contributing too many tokens relative to the other players. This could be due to a lack of information about the other players' strategies, leading to suboptimal decisions on my part. To mitigate this, I will aim to adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the actions of the other players, while also ensuring that I do not contribute so many tokens that my own token count is significantly reduced. This could involve contributing fewer tokens when the other players' contributions are low, and more tokens when they are high, in order to maintain a balance that maximizes my own payoff while also contributing to the public good.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively high, which has resulted in a significant gain for the group but a lower net gain for me due to the even distribution of the public pot. This is because the other players' contributions have generally been lower than mine, allowing them to retain more tokens. To mitigate this, I should aim to contribute fewer tokens in order to increase my net gain, while still contributing enough to maintain a fair share of the public pot. I will adjust my strategy to contribute fewer tokens, while keeping an eye on the contributions of the other players and adjusting my strategy as needed.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively consistent, ranging from 5 to 15 tokens per round. However, my token count has been decreasing over time, which suggests that I may be contributing too many tokens relative to the other players. This could be due to a lack of information about the other players' strategies or an insufficient adaptation to their behavior. To mitigate this failure, I will implement a new plan that involves a more dynamic contribution strategy, taking into account the actions of the other players and adjusting my contributions accordingly. This will help ensure that I maintain a competitive token count while still contributing enough to the public pot to maximize my gains.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or strategy in the number of tokens I am contributing in each round. This inconsistency may be contributing to a lack of overall success in the game. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan to contribute a consistent number of tokens in each round, taking into account the current tokens I possess and the contributions of the other players. This will help me to maintain a more stable and competitive position in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively high, which has resulted in a respectable gain for me but has also left me with significantly fewer tokens than some of the other players. This discrepancy in token counts may put me at a disadvantage in the long run, as the other players with more tokens may be able to contribute more to the public pot and thus receive a larger share of the payoff. To mitigate this potential failure, I will devise a new plan that aims to balance my desire to maximize my own gain with the need to maintain a competitive token count compared to the other players.\n\nIn the next round, I will aim to contribute a moderate number of tokens to the public pot, rather than the higher numbers I have been contributing in the past. By doing so, I hope to strike a balance between maximizing my own gain and maintaining a competitive token count. I will also pay close attention to the token contributions of the other players and adjust my own contributions accordingly in order to remain competitive. Additionally, I will continue to monitor the success of this new strategy and make further adjustments as needed in order to optimize my performance in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively high compared to other players, which has resulted in a lower number of tokens in my possession. This could be a potential reason for failure if the goal is to accumulate the most tokens. To mitigate this, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing fewer tokens to the public pot, while still maintaining a level of contribution that allows for gains in the short term and does not significantly decrease my long-term potential for success. This will require careful observation and analysis of the other players' contributions and adjusting my strategy accordingly.\n\n```"

      "learnings": "Reflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for failure is that I did not contribute any tokens to the public pot in round 1, while other players contributed tokens which led to a higher public good payoff that was divided evenly among all players. This resulted in me receiving a lower individual payoff compared to players who contributed tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing tokens to the public pot in future rounds. This will increase the total tokens in the pot, leading to a higher public good payoff and a larger share of that payoff for me. However, I will also need to balance this with retaining enough tokens in my private collection to ensure that I have a sufficient amount for future rounds. Therefore, my high-level plan is to contribute a moderate number of tokens to the public pot in each round, taking into account the contributions of the other players and adjusting my own contribution accordingly to maximize my individual payoff.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for failure is that I may not be contributing enough tokens to the public pot. In the first round, I contributed 0 tokens while other players contributed 3, 6, 3, and 0 tokens, resulting in a lower public pot and a lower gain for me. In the second round, I contributed 5 tokens, which was still lower than the 5 or 10 tokens contributed by other players. This may have led to a lower public pot and a lower gain for me compared to some of the other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan to contribute more tokens to the public pot in future rounds. I will aim to contribute a higher number of tokens that is more in line with the contributions of the other players, in order to increase the size of the public pot and maximize my gain. I will also consider the contributions of the other players and adjust my own contributions accordingly, in order to ensure that I am not contributing significantly more or less than the other players. This will help to ensure that I am able to maximize my gains in the game while also contributing fairly to the public pot.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for failure is that I am contributing a fixed amount of tokens to the public pot in each round, regardless of the other players' contributions. This strategy may not be optimal because it does not take into account the fact that the public good payoff is evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution. Therefore, if other players contribute more tokens to the public pot, I could potentially gain more by contributing less and benefiting from their contributions.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves adjusting my contribution based on the average contribution of the other players. Specifically, I will calculate the average contribution of the other players in each round and then contribute a percentage of that average. This will allow me to benefit from the other players' contributions while still making a meaningful contribution to the public pot. Additionally, I will also consider the total number of tokens I have and the total number of rounds in the game to ensure that I am not contributing too many tokens too early in the game and running out later on.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have been consistently high, even when other players have contributed less. While this has resulted in a reasonable gain for me in the short term, it has also led to a gradual decrease in my private tokens over time. This is because I am not retaining enough tokens for myself, and am relying too heavily on the public good payoff. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing less to the public pot when other players are contributing significantly less, in order to preserve my private tokens and ensure a more sustainable strategy in the long term.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have generally been in line with those of the other players, resulting in a reasonable share of the public good payoff. However, my token count has been gradually decreasing over time, which suggests that I may be contributing too many tokens relative to the gains I am receiving. To mitigate this, I will aim to contribute fewer tokens to the public pot while still maintaining a level of contribution that is roughly equivalent to the other players, in order to maximize my overall token count. This will require careful observation of the other players' contributions and adjustment of my own strategy as needed.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for a suboptimal performance is that I am contributing a fixed amount of tokens in each round, regardless of the other players' contributions. This strategy may not be maximizing my gains, as I am not taking into account the behavior of the other players and the total amount of tokens they are contributing to the public pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves adapting my contribution based on the total contributions of the other players. Specifically, I will aim to contribute a percentage of my current tokens that is proportional to the average contribution of the other players, in order to maximize my gains while still maintaining a sufficient number of tokens for future rounds. This strategy should allow me to better adapt to the behavior of the other players and increase my overall payoff.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a consistent number of tokens in each round, regardless of the actions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may be leading to suboptimal outcomes. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the actions of the other players and adjusts my contribution accordingly. I will aim to contribute more tokens when other players are contributing more, in order to maximize the public good payoff and ensure that I receive a larger share of this payoff. Additionally, I will aim to retain a sufficient number of tokens in my private collection to ensure that I do not fall behind the other players in terms of total tokens.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have generally been lower than those of some of the other players. This could be a reason for my relative failure in the game, as the public good payoff is divided evenly among all players, regardless of their individual contribution. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing more tokens to the public pot, with the goal of increasing the public good payoff and thus my own earnings. I will aim to balance this with retaining enough tokens in my private collection to ensure that I do not fall too far behind the other players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have generally been lower than those of some of the other players. This could be a reason for my failure to accumulate as many tokens as the other players. In order to mitigate this, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing a higher number of tokens to the public pot, with the goal of increasing the public good payoff and thus my share of it. I will also monitor the contributions of the other players and adjust my strategy as needed to ensure that I am not contributing significantly more than they are.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have generally been in line with those of the other players, resulting in a reasonable distribution of tokens among all participants. However, my token count has been gradually decreasing over time, which suggests that I may not be retaining enough tokens for myself. To mitigate this, I will aim to contribute less to the public pot in order to increase my own token count, while still maintaining a contribution level that is roughly equivalent to the other players. This should allow me to accumulate more tokens over time while still benefiting from the public good payoff.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot in each round, but other players are contributing varying amounts, which sometimes results in higher payoffs for them. This inconsistency in my strategy may be contributing to a lower overall payoff for me compared to some of the other players. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan to adjust my contributions based on the average contribution of the other players, with the goal of maximizing my overall payoff while still contributing to the public good. This will involve analyzing the contributions of the other players in each round and adjusting my own contribution accordingly, with the aim of finding a balance between maximizing my own payoff and contributing to the collective good.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot in each round, regardless of the actions of the other players. This could be a reason for failure, as it does not take into account the varying contributions of the other players and the resulting public pot size. To mitigate this, I will devise a new plan that considers the range of tokens contributed by the other players and adjusts my own contribution accordingly, aiming to maximize my individual gain while also contributing to the growth of the public pot. This will involve analyzing the average and standard deviation of tokens contributed by the other players, and adjusting my contribution to be slightly above the average if the standard deviation is high, indicating varied contributions. If the standard deviation is low, I will contribute an amount closer to the average to avoid losing out on potential gain.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively consistent, ranging from 3 to 7 per round. However, my token count has been gradually decreasing due to the fact that my contributions are often lower than the average contribution of other players, especially those contributing 10 or 11 tokens. This has resulted in my gains being outweighed by the growth in tokens of other players who contribute more.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to contribute tokens more strategically by analyzing the average contribution of other players and adjusting my contribution accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to contribute at or slightly above the average contribution of other players, while still retaining enough tokens to ensure that I do not fall too far behind in terms of overall token count. This will help me to maintain a more stable token count while also maximizing my gains from the public pot.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a consistent number of tokens in each round, regardless of the actions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may be leading to suboptimal outcomes. To mitigate this failure, I will develop a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of the other players. This could involve contributing more tokens when others are contributing less, in order to maximize my own gain while still promoting the public good. I will also consider contributing fewer tokens when others are contributing more, to avoid over-investing in the public pot. Overall, my new plan is to be more responsive to the actions of the other players, in order to achieve better outcomes in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistently high number of tokens to the public pot, which has resulted in a respectable collective gain but has not significantly increased my individual token count. This is likely because the public good payoff is evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution. To mitigate this, I need to adjust my strategy to prioritize my individual gain while still contributing enough tokens to remain competitive and benefit from the public good payoff. A possible high-level plan would be to contribute the minimum number of tokens required to maintain a steady increase in my individual token count, while keeping an eye on the contributions of other players and adjusting my strategy as needed.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively consistent, ranging from 3 to 8 tokens per round. However, my token count has been gradually decreasing due to the fact that the total contributions of the other players often exceed mine, resulting in a lower public pot multiplier and subsequently a lower individual gain. To mitigate this, I should aim to contribute tokens in a way that maximizes my individual gain while also considering the potential contributions of the other players. I could do this by adapting my strategy to the actions of the other players, aiming to contribute a slightly higher number of tokens when the other players' contributions are lower, and a slightly lower number of tokens when the other players' contributions are higher. This should help to maintain a more stable token count over time.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively consistent, ranging from 3 to 15 tokens per round. However, my token count has been decreasing over time, suggesting that my contributions may be too high compared to the other players. This could be due to a misunderstanding of the game's dynamics or an overestimation of the benefit of increasing the public pot. To mitigate this, I will aim to contribute fewer tokens, ideally matching or slightly exceeding the median contribution of the other players, in order to maintain a steady increase in my token count while still contributing to the public pot.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively consistent, ranging from 3 to 15 tokens per round. However, my token count has been decreasing over time, suggesting that I may be contributing too many tokens relative to the other players. This could be due to a lack of information about the other players' strategies, leading to suboptimal decisions on my part. To mitigate this, I will aim to adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the actions of the other players, while also ensuring that I do not contribute so many tokens that my own token count is significantly reduced. This could involve contributing fewer tokens when the other players' contributions are low, and more tokens when they are high, in order to maintain a balance that maximizes my own payoff while also contributing to the public good.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively high, which has resulted in a significant gain for the group but a lower net gain for me due to the even distribution of the public pot. This is because the other players' contributions have generally been lower than mine, allowing them to retain more tokens. To mitigate this, I should aim to contribute fewer tokens in order to increase my net gain, while still contributing enough to maintain a fair share of the public pot. I will adjust my strategy to contribute fewer tokens, while keeping an eye on the contributions of the other players and adjusting my strategy as needed.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively consistent, ranging from 5 to 15 tokens per round. However, my token count has been decreasing over time, which suggests that I may be contributing too many tokens relative to the other players. This could be due to a lack of information about the other players' strategies or an insufficient adaptation to their behavior. To mitigate this failure, I will implement a new plan that involves a more dynamic contribution strategy, taking into account the actions of the other players and adjusting my contributions accordingly. This will help ensure that I maintain a competitive token count while still contributing enough to the public pot to maximize my gains.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or strategy in the number of tokens I am contributing in each round. This inconsistency may be contributing to a lack of overall success in the game. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan to contribute a consistent number of tokens in each round, taking into account the current tokens I possess and the contributions of the other players. This will help me to maintain a more stable and competitive position in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively high, which has resulted in a respectable gain for me but has also left me with significantly fewer tokens than some of the other players. This discrepancy in token counts may put me at a disadvantage in the long run, as the other players with more tokens may be able to contribute more to the public pot and thus receive a larger share of the payoff. To mitigate this potential failure, I will devise a new plan that aims to balance my desire to maximize my own gain with the need to maintain a competitive token count compared to the other players.\n\nIn the next round, I will aim to contribute a moderate number of tokens to the public pot, rather than the higher numbers I have been contributing in the past. By doing so, I hope to strike a balance between maximizing my own gain and maintaining a competitive token count. I will also pay close attention to the token contributions of the other players and adjust my own contributions accordingly in order to remain competitive. Additionally, I will continue to monitor the success of this new strategy and make further adjustments as needed in order to optimize my performance in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively high compared to other players, which has resulted in a lower number of tokens in my possession. This could be a potential reason for failure if the goal is to accumulate the most tokens. To mitigate this, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing fewer tokens to the public pot, while still maintaining a level of contribution that allows for gains in the short term and does not significantly decrease my long-term potential for success. This will require careful observation and analysis of the other players' contributions and adjusting my strategy accordingly.\n",

          "content": "\n\nYou are participating in a game played by 5 players over 40 rounds.\n\nGame Rules:\n\n1. In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for failure is that I did not contribute enough tokens to the public pot. My contribution of 3 tokens was lower than the contributions of players 2 and 3, who contributed 6 and 3 tokens respectively. This likely resulted in a lower public good payoff and a lower gain for me. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing a higher number of tokens to the public pot, while still retaining enough tokens in my private collection to ensure a positive gain. I will also consider the contributions of the other players and aim to contribute a competitive amount to maximize my gain.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for failure or discrepancy is that I may not be optimizing my contributions to maximize my individual payoff. It seems that other players are contributing more tokens to the public pot, which results in a higher public good payoff that is evenly divided among all players. This could mean that I am not contributing enough to the public pot, and thus receiving a smaller share of the public good payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new, concise, high level plan that aims to optimize my contributions to the public pot. I will analyze the contributions of the other players and adjust my own contributions accordingly. If other players are contributing more tokens to the public pot, I will increase my contributions to receive a larger share of the public good payoff. Conversely, if other players are contributing fewer tokens, I will decrease my contributions to retain more tokens in my private collection. By continuously adjusting my contributions based on the actions of the other players, I aim to maximize my individual payoff and improve my performance in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for failure is my inconsistent contribution strategy. While I contributed 3 tokens in the first round, I increased my contribution to 5 tokens in the following rounds, which seems to be the average contribution of other players. However, in round 3, I maintained my contribution of 5 tokens despite other players adjusting their contributions. This inconsistency in my strategy might have affected my overall gain.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new, concise, high-level plan that involves a more consistent contribution strategy. I will analyze the average contribution of other players and adjust my contribution accordingly, ensuring that I maintain a similar level of contribution in subsequent rounds. This will help me maximize my gains while also contributing fairly to the public pot.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a fixed number of tokens in each round, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This could be a reason for failure, as it may not be an optimal strategy to contribute the same number of tokens in every round. A possible discrepancy is that I am not taking into account the contributions of the other players when deciding how many tokens to contribute.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves taking into account the contributions of the other players when deciding how many tokens to contribute. This could involve contributing more tokens when the other players are contributing more, and less tokens when the other players are contributing less. Additionally, I will consider implementing a strategy that adjusts my contributions based on the success of previous rounds, such as contributing more tokens when the public pot has resulted in a higher gain for me in the past.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for a suboptimal performance is that I am contributing a fixed amount of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the other players' contributions. This strategy may not be maximizing my gains, as I am not taking into account the relative amount I am contributing compared to the other players. Additionally, I am not considering the potential future actions of the other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will implement a new strategy that takes into account the other players' contributions and adjusts my own contribution accordingly. I will also consider the potential future actions of the other players and aim to make contributions that will maximize my gains in the long run. This strategy will involve a combination of contributing a sufficient amount to the public pot to ensure a good return, while also retaining enough tokens for future rounds to ensure a steady increase in my total tokens. I will also aim to balance my contributions with the other players to ensure that I am not contributing too much or too little compared to them.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I contributed 5 tokens in the majority of the rounds, and in the rounds where I contributed more (6 tokens in round 6), my individual gain was lower than in rounds where I contributed less. This discrepancy suggests that contributing more tokens does not necessarily result in higher individual gain. Therefore, a possible reason for failure could be that I have been following a strategy that does not optimize for individual gain.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a new high-level plan that aims to balance individual gain and group contribution. Specifically, I will contribute tokens in a way that maximizes my individual gain while also ensuring that my contribution is not significantly lower than the average contribution of the group. This will require monitoring the contributions of other players and adjusting my own contribution accordingly. Additionally, I will consider the size of the public pot and the number of tokens I currently possess when making contribution decisions. Overall, this new plan should help me to optimize my individual gain while also promoting the creation of the public good.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a fixed amount of tokens in each round, regardless of the actions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may be leading to suboptimal outcomes. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the actions of the other players and adjusts my contribution accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to contribute more tokens when other players are also contributing more, in order to maximize the public good payoff and ensure that I receive a higher share of the divided payoff. Additionally, I will aim to retain a sufficient number of tokens in my private collection to ensure that I do not fall too far behind the other players in terms of total tokens.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a fixed amount of tokens in most rounds, regardless of the other players' contributions. This could be a reason for failure, as I might be contributing too much and not leaving enough tokens for myself, or I might be contributing too little and missing out on potential gains from the public pot. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the other players' contributions and adjusts my own contribution accordingly. I will aim to contribute an amount that maximizes my gain while also considering the potential gains from the public pot. This will require me to analyze the contributions of the other players and adjust my strategy dynamically.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a fixed amount of tokens in each round, regardless of the other players' contributions. This inflexibility in my strategy may be leading to suboptimal outcomes. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the recent contributions of the other players and adjusts my own contribution accordingly. This dynamic strategy will aim to maximize my gains while also considering the potential impact on the overall public good.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This has resulted in a stable, but not necessarily optimal, number of tokens in my possession. To improve my performance, I will implement a new plan that takes into account the actions of the other players. Specifically, I will aim to contribute a number of tokens that is proportional to the average contribution of the other players, while still retaining a sufficient number of tokens for myself. This approach should allow me to maximize my gains from the public pot, while also ensuring that I do not fall behind the other players in terms of total tokens.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot in each round, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This could be a reason for failure, as it does not take into account the varying levels of contribution from the other players and the potential impact on the public good payoff. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves adjusting my contribution based on the average contribution of the other players, with the goal of maximizing my individual gain while also contributing to the creation of a substantial public good payoff. This will require me to closely monitor the contributions of the other players and adapt my strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, usually 5 or 6, while other players have been contributing more varied amounts. This has resulted in my token count remaining relatively stable, while other players have seen their token counts fluctuate more. To mitigate this, I will aim to contribute a more variable amount of tokens to the public pot, matching or exceeding the contributions of the other players when possible. This will allow me to potentially increase my token count and avoid being left behind by the other players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the actions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may be leading to suboptimal outcomes. To mitigate this failure, I will develop a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of the other players. This could involve contributing more tokens when others are contributing less, and contributing fewer tokens when others are contributing more. Additionally, I will aim to maintain a balance between maximizing my individual gain and contributing to the public pot to ensure a fair distribution of tokens among all players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens (6) to the public pot, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may be leading to suboptimal outcomes. To mitigate this failure, I will develop a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of the other players, aiming to contribute closer to the median contribution of the group in each round. This approach should help ensure that my contributions are more aligned with the overall trend of the group, potentially leading to higher payoffs.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for a potential failure is my consistent contribution of tokens that is lower than the average contribution of the other players. This behavior could be contributing to a lower public pot and subsequently lower individual earnings. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan to contribute tokens that is more in line with the average contribution of the other players, with the aim of increasing the public pot and improving individual earnings. This will involve monitoring the average contribution of the other players and adjusting my own contribution accordingly to ensure a more equitable distribution of tokens in the public pot.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens (6) to the public pot in each round, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This has resulted in a relatively stable number of tokens in my possession, but it does not seem to have maximized my potential gains. In order to potentially increase my earnings, I should consider adjusting my contribution amount based on the actions of the other players, aiming to contribute a higher number of tokens when the other players' contributions are lower, and a lower number of tokens when the other players' contributions are higher. This approach, known as \"conditional cooperation,\" may help me to better take advantage of opportunities for greater gains in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens (6) to the public pot, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may be leading to suboptimal outcomes. To mitigate this failure, I will develop a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of the other players. I will aim to contribute an amount that is proportional to the average contribution of the other players, while also ensuring that I retain a sufficient number of tokens for future rounds. This approach should allow me to better adapt to the strategies of the other players and maximize my overall gain.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been consistently contributing 6 tokens in each round, regardless of the actions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may have contributed to a suboptimal outcome, as the other players' contributions varied and the total tokens in the public pot fluctuated. To mitigate this failure, I will adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the current state of the game, such as the total tokens in the public pot and the contributions of the other players, in order to make more informed decisions about my own contributions. This will allow me to adjust my strategy as needed and potentially increase my payoff in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have generally been in line with those of the other players, but my token count has been decreasing over time, which suggests that I may be contributing too many tokens relative to the other players. To mitigate this, I will aim to contribute fewer tokens in future rounds, while still maintaining a contribution level that is roughly similar to the other players. This should help to ensure that I am able to maintain a stable token count over time.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens (6) to the public pot in each round, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This consistency may have led to a lack of significant gains for me, as my contributions did not adjust to the changing circumstances of the game. Additionally, there seems to be a discrepancy between the number of tokens I contributed in round 1 (5) and the subsequent rounds (6).\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of the other players. Specifically, I will aim to contribute more tokens when the other players' contributions are lower, in order to increase my share of the public good payoff. Conversely, I will contribute fewer tokens when the other players' contributions are higher, in order to retain more tokens in my private collection. This strategy should allow me to maximize my gains and adapt to the changing dynamics of the game. Furthermore, I will ensure consistency in my contributions by adhering to the same number of tokens contributed in the majority of the rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens (6 or 9) throughout the game, regardless of the actions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may have contributed to a failure to maximize my potential gains. To mitigate this failure, I will develop a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of the other players. This strategy will involve adjusting my contribution based on the average contribution of the other players, aiming to contribute slightly more than the average in order to ensure a net gain while still promoting the growth of the public pot.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively consistent, ranging from 5 to 10 tokens per round. However, my token count has not been increasing steadily, which suggests that my contribution strategy may not be optimized for maximum gain. One possible reason for this is that I may not be taking into account the contributions of the other players when deciding how many tokens to contribute.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the contributions of the other players. Specifically, I will aim to contribute a number of tokens that is proportional to the average contribution of the other players. This will allow me to balance the benefits of contributing to the public pot with the need to retain tokens for my own benefit. Additionally, I will monitor the success of this strategy over time and adjust it as needed based on the performance of the other players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens (6 or 8) throughout the game, which has resulted in a steady but not exceptional gain. The other players' contributions vary more, and they seem to be gaining more tokens than I am. A possible reason for this discrepancy is that I have been too conservative in my contributions, and I have not been adjusting my strategy based on the other players' moves.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the other players' contributions and adjusts my own contribution accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to contribute more tokens when the other players' contributions are low, and contribute fewer tokens when the other players' contributions are high. This will allow me to maximize my gain while still maintaining a competitive position in the game. I will also monitor the game state more closely and adjust my strategy as needed to respond to changes in the other players' behavior.\n\n```"

      "learnings": "Reflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for failure is that I did not contribute enough tokens to the public pot. My contribution of 3 tokens was lower than the contributions of players 2 and 3, who contributed 6 and 3 tokens respectively. This likely resulted in a lower public good payoff and a lower gain for me. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing a higher number of tokens to the public pot, while still retaining enough tokens in my private collection to ensure a positive gain. I will also consider the contributions of the other players and aim to contribute a competitive amount to maximize my gain.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for failure or discrepancy is that I may not be optimizing my contributions to maximize my individual payoff. It seems that other players are contributing more tokens to the public pot, which results in a higher public good payoff that is evenly divided among all players. This could mean that I am not contributing enough to the public pot, and thus receiving a smaller share of the public good payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new, concise, high level plan that aims to optimize my contributions to the public pot. I will analyze the contributions of the other players and adjust my own contributions accordingly. If other players are contributing more tokens to the public pot, I will increase my contributions to receive a larger share of the public good payoff. Conversely, if other players are contributing fewer tokens, I will decrease my contributions to retain more tokens in my private collection. By continuously adjusting my contributions based on the actions of the other players, I aim to maximize my individual payoff and improve my performance in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for failure is my inconsistent contribution strategy. While I contributed 3 tokens in the first round, I increased my contribution to 5 tokens in the following rounds, which seems to be the average contribution of other players. However, in round 3, I maintained my contribution of 5 tokens despite other players adjusting their contributions. This inconsistency in my strategy might have affected my overall gain.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new, concise, high-level plan that involves a more consistent contribution strategy. I will analyze the average contribution of other players and adjust my contribution accordingly, ensuring that I maintain a similar level of contribution in subsequent rounds. This will help me maximize my gains while also contributing fairly to the public pot.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a fixed number of tokens in each round, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This could be a reason for failure, as it may not be an optimal strategy to contribute the same number of tokens in every round. A possible discrepancy is that I am not taking into account the contributions of the other players when deciding how many tokens to contribute.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves taking into account the contributions of the other players when deciding how many tokens to contribute. This could involve contributing more tokens when the other players are contributing more, and less tokens when the other players are contributing less. Additionally, I will consider implementing a strategy that adjusts my contributions based on the success of previous rounds, such as contributing more tokens when the public pot has resulted in a higher gain for me in the past.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for a suboptimal performance is that I am contributing a fixed amount of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the other players' contributions. This strategy may not be maximizing my gains, as I am not taking into account the relative amount I am contributing compared to the other players. Additionally, I am not considering the potential future actions of the other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will implement a new strategy that takes into account the other players' contributions and adjusts my own contribution accordingly. I will also consider the potential future actions of the other players and aim to make contributions that will maximize my gains in the long run. This strategy will involve a combination of contributing a sufficient amount to the public pot to ensure a good return, while also retaining enough tokens for future rounds to ensure a steady increase in my total tokens. I will also aim to balance my contributions with the other players to ensure that I am not contributing too much or too little compared to them.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I contributed 5 tokens in the majority of the rounds, and in the rounds where I contributed more (6 tokens in round 6), my individual gain was lower than in rounds where I contributed less. This discrepancy suggests that contributing more tokens does not necessarily result in higher individual gain. Therefore, a possible reason for failure could be that I have been following a strategy that does not optimize for individual gain.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a new high-level plan that aims to balance individual gain and group contribution. Specifically, I will contribute tokens in a way that maximizes my individual gain while also ensuring that my contribution is not significantly lower than the average contribution of the group. This will require monitoring the contributions of other players and adjusting my own contribution accordingly. Additionally, I will consider the size of the public pot and the number of tokens I currently possess when making contribution decisions. Overall, this new plan should help me to optimize my individual gain while also promoting the creation of the public good.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a fixed amount of tokens in each round, regardless of the actions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may be leading to suboptimal outcomes. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the actions of the other players and adjusts my contribution accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to contribute more tokens when other players are also contributing more, in order to maximize the public good payoff and ensure that I receive a higher share of the divided payoff. Additionally, I will aim to retain a sufficient number of tokens in my private collection to ensure that I do not fall too far behind the other players in terms of total tokens.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a fixed amount of tokens in most rounds, regardless of the other players' contributions. This could be a reason for failure, as I might be contributing too much and not leaving enough tokens for myself, or I might be contributing too little and missing out on potential gains from the public pot. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the other players' contributions and adjusts my own contribution accordingly. I will aim to contribute an amount that maximizes my gain while also considering the potential gains from the public pot. This will require me to analyze the contributions of the other players and adjust my strategy dynamically.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a fixed amount of tokens in each round, regardless of the other players' contributions. This inflexibility in my strategy may be leading to suboptimal outcomes. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the recent contributions of the other players and adjusts my own contribution accordingly. This dynamic strategy will aim to maximize my gains while also considering the potential impact on the overall public good.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This has resulted in a stable, but not necessarily optimal, number of tokens in my possession. To improve my performance, I will implement a new plan that takes into account the actions of the other players. Specifically, I will aim to contribute a number of tokens that is proportional to the average contribution of the other players, while still retaining a sufficient number of tokens for myself. This approach should allow me to maximize my gains from the public pot, while also ensuring that I do not fall behind the other players in terms of total tokens.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot in each round, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This could be a reason for failure, as it does not take into account the varying levels of contribution from the other players and the potential impact on the public good payoff. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves adjusting my contribution based on the average contribution of the other players, with the goal of maximizing my individual gain while also contributing to the creation of a substantial public good payoff. This will require me to closely monitor the contributions of the other players and adapt my strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, usually 5 or 6, while other players have been contributing more varied amounts. This has resulted in my token count remaining relatively stable, while other players have seen their token counts fluctuate more. To mitigate this, I will aim to contribute a more variable amount of tokens to the public pot, matching or exceeding the contributions of the other players when possible. This will allow me to potentially increase my token count and avoid being left behind by the other players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the actions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may be leading to suboptimal outcomes. To mitigate this failure, I will develop a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of the other players. This could involve contributing more tokens when others are contributing less, and contributing fewer tokens when others are contributing more. Additionally, I will aim to maintain a balance between maximizing my individual gain and contributing to the public pot to ensure a fair distribution of tokens among all players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens (6) to the public pot, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may be leading to suboptimal outcomes. To mitigate this failure, I will develop a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of the other players, aiming to contribute closer to the median contribution of the group in each round. This approach should help ensure that my contributions are more aligned with the overall trend of the group, potentially leading to higher payoffs.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for a potential failure is my consistent contribution of tokens that is lower than the average contribution of the other players. This behavior could be contributing to a lower public pot and subsequently lower individual earnings. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan to contribute tokens that is more in line with the average contribution of the other players, with the aim of increasing the public pot and improving individual earnings. This will involve monitoring the average contribution of the other players and adjusting my own contribution accordingly to ensure a more equitable distribution of tokens in the public pot.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens (6) to the public pot in each round, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This has resulted in a relatively stable number of tokens in my possession, but it does not seem to have maximized my potential gains. In order to potentially increase my earnings, I should consider adjusting my contribution amount based on the actions of the other players, aiming to contribute a higher number of tokens when the other players' contributions are lower, and a lower number of tokens when the other players' contributions are higher. This approach, known as \"conditional cooperation,\" may help me to better take advantage of opportunities for greater gains in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens (6) to the public pot, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may be leading to suboptimal outcomes. To mitigate this failure, I will develop a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of the other players. I will aim to contribute an amount that is proportional to the average contribution of the other players, while also ensuring that I retain a sufficient number of tokens for future rounds. This approach should allow me to better adapt to the strategies of the other players and maximize my overall gain.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been consistently contributing 6 tokens in each round, regardless of the actions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may have contributed to a suboptimal outcome, as the other players' contributions varied and the total tokens in the public pot fluctuated. To mitigate this failure, I will adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the current state of the game, such as the total tokens in the public pot and the contributions of the other players, in order to make more informed decisions about my own contributions. This will allow me to adjust my strategy as needed and potentially increase my payoff in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have generally been in line with those of the other players, but my token count has been decreasing over time, which suggests that I may be contributing too many tokens relative to the other players. To mitigate this, I will aim to contribute fewer tokens in future rounds, while still maintaining a contribution level that is roughly similar to the other players. This should help to ensure that I am able to maintain a stable token count over time.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens (6) to the public pot in each round, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This consistency may have led to a lack of significant gains for me, as my contributions did not adjust to the changing circumstances of the game. Additionally, there seems to be a discrepancy between the number of tokens I contributed in round 1 (5) and the subsequent rounds (6).\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of the other players. Specifically, I will aim to contribute more tokens when the other players' contributions are lower, in order to increase my share of the public good payoff. Conversely, I will contribute fewer tokens when the other players' contributions are higher, in order to retain more tokens in my private collection. This strategy should allow me to maximize my gains and adapt to the changing dynamics of the game. Furthermore, I will ensure consistency in my contributions by adhering to the same number of tokens contributed in the majority of the rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens (6 or 9) throughout the game, regardless of the actions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may have contributed to a failure to maximize my potential gains. To mitigate this failure, I will develop a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of the other players. This strategy will involve adjusting my contribution based on the average contribution of the other players, aiming to contribute slightly more than the average in order to ensure a net gain while still promoting the growth of the public pot.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively consistent, ranging from 5 to 10 tokens per round. However, my token count has not been increasing steadily, which suggests that my contribution strategy may not be optimized for maximum gain. One possible reason for this is that I may not be taking into account the contributions of the other players when deciding how many tokens to contribute.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the contributions of the other players. Specifically, I will aim to contribute a number of tokens that is proportional to the average contribution of the other players. This will allow me to balance the benefits of contributing to the public pot with the need to retain tokens for my own benefit. Additionally, I will monitor the success of this strategy over time and adjust it as needed based on the performance of the other players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens (6 or 8) throughout the game, which has resulted in a steady but not exceptional gain. The other players' contributions vary more, and they seem to be gaining more tokens than I am. A possible reason for this discrepancy is that I have been too conservative in my contributions, and I have not been adjusting my strategy based on the other players' moves.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the other players' contributions and adjusts my own contribution accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to contribute more tokens when the other players' contributions are low, and contribute fewer tokens when the other players' contributions are high. This will allow me to maximize my gain while still maintaining a competitive position in the game. I will also monitor the game state more closely and adjust my strategy as needed to respond to changes in the other players' behavior.\n",

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I contributed 0 tokens in round 1, which resulted in a negative gain and a lower total of tokens compared to some of the other players. A possible reason for this failure is that I may have prioritized retaining my private tokens over contributing to the public pot. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the importance of contributing to the public pot to increase the public good payoff, which will ultimately lead to higher overall gains.\n\nMy new, concise, high level plan is to contribute a consistent and strategic number of tokens to the public pot in each round, taking into account the contributions of the other players and the potential gains from the public good payoff. This will require me to balance the desire to retain private tokens with the need to contribute to the public pot in order to maximize my overall gains. I will also reflect on my past contributions and adjust my strategy accordingly to improve my performance in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for failure is my inconsistent contribution strategy, which ranges from not contributing any tokens in the first round to contributing a significant portion of my tokens in the second round. This inconsistency may have led to unstable public pot sizes and unpredictable individual gains, ultimately resulting in a suboptimal outcome for me.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new, concise, high-level plan that involves a more consistent contribution strategy. Specifically, I will aim to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens in each round, taking into account the potential benefits of both maximizing my individual gain and promoting a larger public pot for overall group welfare. This balanced approach should help stabilize the public pot size and my individual token count, leading to more predictable and favorable outcomes in the long run.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have been lower than those of some other players. This has resulted in a lower \"public good\" payoff for me, as the payoff is divided evenly among all players, regardless of their individual contribution. In order to mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the contributions of the other players and aims to contribute a more competitive amount to the public pot. This may involve increasing my contributions in certain rounds or adjusting my strategy based on the actions of the other players. By doing so, I hope to improve my overall payoff and achieve a more successful outcome in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have been inconsistent, ranging from 0 to 6 tokens. This inconsistency may have contributed to my fluctuating gains and the unpredictable changes in my token count. To mitigate this issue, I will aim to adopt a more consistent contribution strategy. I will analyze the average contribution of all players, including myself, and adjust my contributions to align more closely with this average. This approach should help maintain a more stable token count and potentially lead to more consistent gains.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have been inconsistent, ranging from 0 to 6 tokens. This inconsistency may have contributed to my fluctuating gains and overall token count. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that aims for a more consistent contribution strategy. I will consider the average contribution of the other players and strive to match or slightly exceed that amount, while also taking into account the potential impact on my overall token count. This balanced approach should help to stabilize my gains and improve my performance in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a significant number of tokens to the public pot, but my individual gains are not as high as some of the other players. This could be due to the fact that I am contributing more tokens than necessary, and not retaining enough tokens for myself. Additionally, there seems to be a discrepancy in the phrasing of my contributions compared to the other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the contributions of the other players and aims to balance my own token retention with public pot contributions. I will also make sure to use consistent phrasing in my contributions to avoid any confusion.\n\nIn practice, this means that I will aim to contribute fewer tokens than the player who contributes the most, but more tokens than the player who contributes the least. I will also keep track of the average contribution of all players and aim to contribute around that amount. This way, I can ensure that I am making a fair contribution to the public pot while also retaining enough tokens for myself. Additionally, I will make sure to use the same phrasing as the other players when reporting my contributions to avoid any confusion.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a significant number of tokens to the public pot, but my individual gains are not as high as some of the other players. This could be due to the fact that I am contributing more tokens than necessary, and not retaining enough in my private collection. Additionally, there seems to be a discrepancy in the phrasing of the game rules provided, as it is stated that the total tokens in the pot will be multiplied by the factor 2, but in the game results, the multiplication factor appears to be 3.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the multiplication factor and aims to retain a larger number of tokens in my private collection. I will contribute a number of tokens to the public pot that is proportional to the multiplication factor, so that I can maximize my individual gain while still contributing to the public good. Additionally, I will monitor the contributions of the other players and adjust my own contributions accordingly, in order to ensure that I am not contributing more than necessary.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my performance has been inconsistent, with both positive and negative gains. One possible reason for this inconsistency could be the lack of a clear strategy for determining my contributions to the public pot. I have been matching the contributions of player_2, but this approach does not take into account the contributions of other players or the current state of the game.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a new, concise, high-level plan that considers the average contribution of all players, rather than just matching the contributions of player_2. This will allow me to make more informed decisions about how many tokens to contribute to the public pot, and potentially lead to more consistent gains. Additionally, I will consider the current state of the game, such as the number of tokens I currently have in my private collection, when making these decisions. By taking these factors into account, I hope to improve my performance and increase my overall gains in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the other players' contributions. This has led to a situation where I am gaining less than some of the other players, as they are contributing more tokens and therefore receiving a larger share of the public good payoff. To mitigate this failure, I will implement a new plan that takes into account the other players' contributions and adjusts my own contribution accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to contribute more tokens when the other players' contributions are high, in order to maximize my share of the public good payoff. Additionally, I will aim to contribute fewer tokens when the other players' contributions are low, in order to retain more tokens in my private collection.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the actions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may have contributed to my failure to maximize my gains. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the actions of the other players and adjusts my contribution accordingly. I will aim to contribute more tokens when other players contribute more, in order to increase the public good payoff and my share of it, while still retaining some tokens for myself. Conversely, I will contribute fewer tokens when other players contribute less, in order to retain more tokens for myself and avoid losing out on potential gains. This more dynamic strategy should help me to maximize my gains in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a consistently high number of tokens to the public pot, which is not significantly different from the contributions of other players. However, my starting number of tokens was lower than that of the other players, and as a result, my token count has been gradually decreasing relative to the other players. This is because the public payoff, which is divided equally among all players, does not compensate for the disproportionate number of tokens I have contributed.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adjust my strategy to contribute fewer tokens to the public pot, while still aiming to contribute enough to maintain a competitive position. By retaining more tokens in my private collection, I can prevent my token count from decreasing relative to the other players. I will also monitor the contributions of the other players and adjust my strategy accordingly, with the goal of maximizing my overall token count and minimizing any potential losses.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a similar number of tokens as the other players, but my token count has been decreasing over time, which suggests that I may be contributing too much to the public pot relative to the other players. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing fewer tokens to the public pot, while still aiming to maintain a competitive token count compared to the other players. This will allow me to retain more tokens in my private collection and potentially increase my overall gain.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively consistent, ranging from 5 to 8 tokens per round. However, my token count has been gradually decreasing due to the gains being lower than the contributions in some rounds. This could be due to the higher contributions of some players, causing the public pot to be distributed among more tokens, thereby reducing my individual gain. To mitigate this, I need to adjust my strategy to contribute tokens in a way that maximizes my individual gain, taking into account the contributions of other players. I could, for instance, contribute fewer tokens when others contribute higher numbers and more when others contribute less, aiming to maintain a balance that ensures a net positive gain in tokens.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistently average amount of tokens to the public pot, which has resulted in a steady but not exceptional gain for me. However, I notice that some players, like player_2, have been contributing more tokens than me in certain rounds, which results in a larger public pot and a higher gain for all players, including themselves. To mitigate this, I should consider adjusting my strategy to contribute more tokens to the public pot in order to increase the overall payoff and potentially gain more tokens in the long run. I should also pay attention to the contributions of other players and adjust my strategy accordingly to remain competitive.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistently high number of tokens to the public pot, which has resulted in a respectable collective gain but has not significantly increased my individual token count. This discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that the public pot's contents are evenly distributed among all players, regardless of their individual contribution. To mitigate this, I should adjust my strategy to prioritize my individual gain while still contributing enough tokens to maintain a reasonable collective payoff. A new, high-level plan could involve contributing the minimum number of tokens required to keep the collective payoff above a certain threshold, allowing me to maximize my individual token count and increase my chances of winning the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there was a significant increase in the number of tokens contributed by player_2 in round 16, which led to a decrease in my tokens due to the even division of the public good payoff. This sudden change in player_2's strategy might have been a response to my previous contributions or an attempt to maximize their individual gain. To mitigate this failure, I will adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players and adjusts mine accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to contribute an amount close to the median contribution of the other players, while also ensuring that my contributions do not fall significantly below the average. This approach should help maintain a balance between maximizing my individual gain and contributing to the public pot, thereby preventing a drastic decrease in my tokens due to the actions of a single player.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is a discrepancy in the number of tokens contributed by Player 2 in some rounds, as their contribution does not match the amount reported by the Game Master. For example, in round 13, Player 2 is reported to have contributed 8 tokens, but the Game Master's report shows a contribution of 6 tokens. This discrepancy may be due to a miscommunication or error in reporting.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan would be to ensure clear and consistent communication between all players and the Game Master regarding the number of tokens contributed in each round. This could be achieved through the use of a standardized reporting format or by having a designated player or third-party verify the contributions before they are submitted to the Game Master. Additionally, regularly reviewing and reconciling the game log can help identify and correct any discrepancies in a timely manner.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there was a significant increase in tokens contributed by player_2 in round 16, which led to a decrease in my tokens and no gain in that round. This inconsistency in player_2's contributions may have contributed to the overall volatility in the game. To mitigate this failure, I will aim to maintain a more consistent contribution strategy, taking into account the historical data and adjusting my contributions based on the other players' behavior while ensuring that I do not contribute too many tokens at once, which could lead to a negative impact on my token count.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there was a significant increase in tokens contributed by player_2 in round 16, which resulted in a much larger public pot but with no gain for player_2. This suggests that contributing a disproportionately high number of tokens may not be beneficial, as the gain is still divided equally among all players. To mitigate this, a new plan could be to aim for a more balanced contribution that is neither too low nor too high compared to the other players. This would allow for a fair share of the public good payoff while also retaining a sufficient number of private tokens. Additionally, it may be helpful to pay closer attention to the contributions of the other players and adjust accordingly to avoid being at a disadvantage.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there was a significant increase in tokens contributed by player_2 in round 16, which led to a decrease in my tokens due to the even distribution of the public good payoff. This sudden change in player_2's strategy caused a negative impact on my token count. To mitigate this failure, I will develop a more dynamic strategy that can adapt to sudden changes in other players' contributions. I will monitor the tokens contributed by player_2 and other players more closely and adjust my contribution accordingly to minimize the potential negative effects of sudden strategy changes.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is a discrepancy in the number of tokens I contributed in some rounds, as there are instances where I contributed more tokens than I actually have. This could be due to a programming error or misunderstanding of the rules. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan would be to carefully review and double-check the number of tokens I have before deciding how many to contribute in each round, ensuring that I do not contribute more tokens than I currently possess. Additionally, I will aim to maintain a balance between contributing enough tokens to the public pot to maximize gains while also retaining a sufficient number of tokens for future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is a discrepancy in the number of tokens contributed by \"player_2\" in some rounds, which is different from the number of tokens I contributed. This discrepancy may have led to a failure in accurately assessing the performance of my strategy. To mitigate this failure, I will implement a self-check mechanism to verify the correctness of the tokens contributed by all players, including myself, before proceeding with the calculation of the public pot and the subsequent gains.\n\nMy new, concise, high-level plan is to:\n\n1. Verify the accuracy of the tokens contributed by all players.\n2. Calculate the total tokens in the public pot.\n3. Compute the gain for each player.\n4. Update the tokens of each player after each round.\n\nBy implementing this plan, I aim to ensure the accuracy of the game data and make more informed decisions in contributing tokens to the public pot.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or strategy in the number of tokens contributed by the other players, including player_2. However, I notice that in rounds where I contribute a higher number of tokens, such as 15 in round 17 and 18 in round 21, I receive a higher gain due to the larger public pot. Therefore, a possible strategy could be to contribute a higher number of tokens consistently, aiming to increase the public pot and thus my own gain. This strategy assumes that the total contribution of all players will remain relatively constant, and that the benefits of a larger public pot will outweigh the costs of contributing more tokens. I will adjust my future contributions accordingly, while remaining flexible to changes in the strategies of the other players.\n\n```"

      "learnings": "Reflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I contributed 0 tokens in round 1, which resulted in a negative gain and a lower total of tokens compared to some of the other players. A possible reason for this failure is that I may have prioritized retaining my private tokens over contributing to the public pot. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the importance of contributing to the public pot to increase the public good payoff, which will ultimately lead to higher overall gains.\n\nMy new, concise, high level plan is to contribute a consistent and strategic number of tokens to the public pot in each round, taking into account the contributions of the other players and the potential gains from the public good payoff. This will require me to balance the desire to retain private tokens with the need to contribute to the public pot in order to maximize my overall gains. I will also reflect on my past contributions and adjust my strategy accordingly to improve my performance in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for failure is my inconsistent contribution strategy, which ranges from not contributing any tokens in the first round to contributing a significant portion of my tokens in the second round. This inconsistency may have led to unstable public pot sizes and unpredictable individual gains, ultimately resulting in a suboptimal outcome for me.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new, concise, high-level plan that involves a more consistent contribution strategy. Specifically, I will aim to contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens in each round, taking into account the potential benefits of both maximizing my individual gain and promoting a larger public pot for overall group welfare. This balanced approach should help stabilize the public pot size and my individual token count, leading to more predictable and favorable outcomes in the long run.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have been lower than those of some other players. This has resulted in a lower \"public good\" payoff for me, as the payoff is divided evenly among all players, regardless of their individual contribution. In order to mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the contributions of the other players and aims to contribute a more competitive amount to the public pot. This may involve increasing my contributions in certain rounds or adjusting my strategy based on the actions of the other players. By doing so, I hope to improve my overall payoff and achieve a more successful outcome in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have been inconsistent, ranging from 0 to 6 tokens. This inconsistency may have contributed to my fluctuating gains and the unpredictable changes in my token count. To mitigate this issue, I will aim to adopt a more consistent contribution strategy. I will analyze the average contribution of all players, including myself, and adjust my contributions to align more closely with this average. This approach should help maintain a more stable token count and potentially lead to more consistent gains.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have been inconsistent, ranging from 0 to 6 tokens. This inconsistency may have contributed to my fluctuating gains and overall token count. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that aims for a more consistent contribution strategy. I will consider the average contribution of the other players and strive to match or slightly exceed that amount, while also taking into account the potential impact on my overall token count. This balanced approach should help to stabilize my gains and improve my performance in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a significant number of tokens to the public pot, but my individual gains are not as high as some of the other players. This could be due to the fact that I am contributing more tokens than necessary, and not retaining enough tokens for myself. Additionally, there seems to be a discrepancy in the phrasing of my contributions compared to the other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the contributions of the other players and aims to balance my own token retention with public pot contributions. I will also make sure to use consistent phrasing in my contributions to avoid any confusion.\n\nIn practice, this means that I will aim to contribute fewer tokens than the player who contributes the most, but more tokens than the player who contributes the least. I will also keep track of the average contribution of all players and aim to contribute around that amount. This way, I can ensure that I am making a fair contribution to the public pot while also retaining enough tokens for myself. Additionally, I will make sure to use the same phrasing as the other players when reporting my contributions to avoid any confusion.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a significant number of tokens to the public pot, but my individual gains are not as high as some of the other players. This could be due to the fact that I am contributing more tokens than necessary, and not retaining enough in my private collection. Additionally, there seems to be a discrepancy in the phrasing of the game rules provided, as it is stated that the total tokens in the pot will be multiplied by the factor 2, but in the game results, the multiplication factor appears to be 3.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the multiplication factor and aims to retain a larger number of tokens in my private collection. I will contribute a number of tokens to the public pot that is proportional to the multiplication factor, so that I can maximize my individual gain while still contributing to the public good. Additionally, I will monitor the contributions of the other players and adjust my own contributions accordingly, in order to ensure that I am not contributing more than necessary.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my performance has been inconsistent, with both positive and negative gains. One possible reason for this inconsistency could be the lack of a clear strategy for determining my contributions to the public pot. I have been matching the contributions of player_2, but this approach does not take into account the contributions of other players or the current state of the game.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a new, concise, high-level plan that considers the average contribution of all players, rather than just matching the contributions of player_2. This will allow me to make more informed decisions about how many tokens to contribute to the public pot, and potentially lead to more consistent gains. Additionally, I will consider the current state of the game, such as the number of tokens I currently have in my private collection, when making these decisions. By taking these factors into account, I hope to improve my performance and increase my overall gains in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the other players' contributions. This has led to a situation where I am gaining less than some of the other players, as they are contributing more tokens and therefore receiving a larger share of the public good payoff. To mitigate this failure, I will implement a new plan that takes into account the other players' contributions and adjusts my own contribution accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to contribute more tokens when the other players' contributions are high, in order to maximize my share of the public good payoff. Additionally, I will aim to contribute fewer tokens when the other players' contributions are low, in order to retain more tokens in my private collection.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the actions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may have contributed to my failure to maximize my gains. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the actions of the other players and adjusts my contribution accordingly. I will aim to contribute more tokens when other players contribute more, in order to increase the public good payoff and my share of it, while still retaining some tokens for myself. Conversely, I will contribute fewer tokens when other players contribute less, in order to retain more tokens for myself and avoid losing out on potential gains. This more dynamic strategy should help me to maximize my gains in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I am contributing a consistently high number of tokens to the public pot, which is not significantly different from the contributions of other players. However, my starting number of tokens was lower than that of the other players, and as a result, my token count has been gradually decreasing relative to the other players. This is because the public payoff, which is divided equally among all players, does not compensate for the disproportionate number of tokens I have contributed.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adjust my strategy to contribute fewer tokens to the public pot, while still aiming to contribute enough to maintain a competitive position. By retaining more tokens in my private collection, I can prevent my token count from decreasing relative to the other players. I will also monitor the contributions of the other players and adjust my strategy accordingly, with the goal of maximizing my overall token count and minimizing any potential losses.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a similar number of tokens as the other players, but my token count has been decreasing over time, which suggests that I may be contributing too much to the public pot relative to the other players. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing fewer tokens to the public pot, while still aiming to maintain a competitive token count compared to the other players. This will allow me to retain more tokens in my private collection and potentially increase my overall gain.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively consistent, ranging from 5 to 8 tokens per round. However, my token count has been gradually decreasing due to the gains being lower than the contributions in some rounds. This could be due to the higher contributions of some players, causing the public pot to be distributed among more tokens, thereby reducing my individual gain. To mitigate this, I need to adjust my strategy to contribute tokens in a way that maximizes my individual gain, taking into account the contributions of other players. I could, for instance, contribute fewer tokens when others contribute higher numbers and more when others contribute less, aiming to maintain a balance that ensures a net positive gain in tokens.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistently average amount of tokens to the public pot, which has resulted in a steady but not exceptional gain for me. However, I notice that some players, like player_2, have been contributing more tokens than me in certain rounds, which results in a larger public pot and a higher gain for all players, including themselves. To mitigate this, I should consider adjusting my strategy to contribute more tokens to the public pot in order to increase the overall payoff and potentially gain more tokens in the long run. I should also pay attention to the contributions of other players and adjust my strategy accordingly to remain competitive.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistently high number of tokens to the public pot, which has resulted in a respectable collective gain but has not significantly increased my individual token count. This discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that the public pot's contents are evenly distributed among all players, regardless of their individual contribution. To mitigate this, I should adjust my strategy to prioritize my individual gain while still contributing enough tokens to maintain a reasonable collective payoff. A new, high-level plan could involve contributing the minimum number of tokens required to keep the collective payoff above a certain threshold, allowing me to maximize my individual token count and increase my chances of winning the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there was a significant increase in the number of tokens contributed by player_2 in round 16, which led to a decrease in my tokens due to the even division of the public good payoff. This sudden change in player_2's strategy might have been a response to my previous contributions or an attempt to maximize their individual gain. To mitigate this failure, I will adopt a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of other players and adjusts mine accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to contribute an amount close to the median contribution of the other players, while also ensuring that my contributions do not fall significantly below the average. This approach should help maintain a balance between maximizing my individual gain and contributing to the public pot, thereby preventing a drastic decrease in my tokens due to the actions of a single player.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is a discrepancy in the number of tokens contributed by Player 2 in some rounds, as their contribution does not match the amount reported by the Game Master. For example, in round 13, Player 2 is reported to have contributed 8 tokens, but the Game Master's report shows a contribution of 6 tokens. This discrepancy may be due to a miscommunication or error in reporting.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan would be to ensure clear and consistent communication between all players and the Game Master regarding the number of tokens contributed in each round. This could be achieved through the use of a standardized reporting format or by having a designated player or third-party verify the contributions before they are submitted to the Game Master. Additionally, regularly reviewing and reconciling the game log can help identify and correct any discrepancies in a timely manner.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there was a significant increase in tokens contributed by player_2 in round 16, which led to a decrease in my tokens and no gain in that round. This inconsistency in player_2's contributions may have contributed to the overall volatility in the game. To mitigate this failure, I will aim to maintain a more consistent contribution strategy, taking into account the historical data and adjusting my contributions based on the other players' behavior while ensuring that I do not contribute too many tokens at once, which could lead to a negative impact on my token count.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there was a significant increase in tokens contributed by player_2 in round 16, which resulted in a much larger public pot but with no gain for player_2. This suggests that contributing a disproportionately high number of tokens may not be beneficial, as the gain is still divided equally among all players. To mitigate this, a new plan could be to aim for a more balanced contribution that is neither too low nor too high compared to the other players. This would allow for a fair share of the public good payoff while also retaining a sufficient number of private tokens. Additionally, it may be helpful to pay closer attention to the contributions of the other players and adjust accordingly to avoid being at a disadvantage.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there was a significant increase in tokens contributed by player_2 in round 16, which led to a decrease in my tokens due to the even distribution of the public good payoff. This sudden change in player_2's strategy caused a negative impact on my token count. To mitigate this failure, I will develop a more dynamic strategy that can adapt to sudden changes in other players' contributions. I will monitor the tokens contributed by player_2 and other players more closely and adjust my contribution accordingly to minimize the potential negative effects of sudden strategy changes.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is a discrepancy in the number of tokens I contributed in some rounds, as there are instances where I contributed more tokens than I actually have. This could be due to a programming error or misunderstanding of the rules. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan would be to carefully review and double-check the number of tokens I have before deciding how many to contribute in each round, ensuring that I do not contribute more tokens than I currently possess. Additionally, I will aim to maintain a balance between contributing enough tokens to the public pot to maximize gains while also retaining a sufficient number of tokens for future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is a discrepancy in the number of tokens contributed by \"player_2\" in some rounds, which is different from the number of tokens I contributed. This discrepancy may have led to a failure in accurately assessing the performance of my strategy. To mitigate this failure, I will implement a self-check mechanism to verify the correctness of the tokens contributed by all players, including myself, before proceeding with the calculation of the public pot and the subsequent gains.\n\nMy new, concise, high-level plan is to:\n\n1. Verify the accuracy of the tokens contributed by all players.\n2. Calculate the total tokens in the public pot.\n3. Compute the gain for each player.\n4. Update the tokens of each player after each round.\n\nBy implementing this plan, I aim to ensure the accuracy of the game data and make more informed decisions in contributing tokens to the public pot.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that there is no clear pattern or strategy in the number of tokens contributed by the other players, including player_2. However, I notice that in rounds where I contribute a higher number of tokens, such as 15 in round 17 and 18 in round 21, I receive a higher gain due to the larger public pot. Therefore, a possible strategy could be to contribute a higher number of tokens consistently, aiming to increase the public pot and thus my own gain. This strategy assumes that the total contribution of all players will remain relatively constant, and that the benefits of a larger public pot will outweigh the costs of contributing more tokens. I will adjust my future contributions accordingly, while remaining flexible to changes in the strategies of the other players.\n",

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for failure could be that I may not have contributed enough tokens to the public pot in comparison to other players. This could have resulted in a lower public good payoff for me, despite the even division among all players. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing a higher number of tokens to the public pot, while still retaining enough tokens for potential future rounds. This will aim to increase my share of the public good payoff, and ultimately lead to a higher total token count for me.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for failure or discrepancy is that I may not be optimizing my token contributions to maximize my individual payoff. It seems that my contributions should be balanced between retaining tokens in my private collection and contributing to the public pot to increase the overall payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new, concise, high-level plan that takes into account the contributions of other players and adjusts my own contributions accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to contribute enough tokens to the public pot to ensure a significant increase in the overall payoff, while also retaining a sufficient number of tokens in my private collection to maintain a competitive position in the game. This will involve analyzing the contributions of other players and adjusting my own contributions in response, with the goal of maximizing my individual payoff over the course of the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contribution strategy has been inconsistent and not directly tied to the actions of the other players. This inconsistency may have led to suboptimal outcomes, as seen in Round 3 where I contributed a high amount (10) but the public pot increased only slightly (31). To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the average contribution of the other players and adjusts my contribution accordingly. This adjusted strategy should help me maximize my gains while also promoting a more consistent contribution pattern.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have been inconsistent, ranging from 0 to 10 tokens. This inconsistency may have contributed to a lower overall payoff for me in certain rounds. To mitigate this inconsistency and aim for a more stable and potentially higher payoff, I will adopt a more consistent contribution strategy. Specifically, I will aim to contribute a fixed percentage of my current tokens in each round, such as 50%, rather than a fixed number of tokens. This strategy should help ensure that my contributions are more consistent and better aligned with my current resources.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have been inconsistent, ranging from 0 to 10 tokens. This inconsistency may have contributed to a lower overall payoff, as other players may not have been able to predict or rely on my contributions. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that aims for consistency in my contributions. I will contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens in each round, rather than a fluctuating number. This will allow other players to better anticipate my contributions and potentially lead to more stable outcomes.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have been consistently high, even when other players have contributed less. While this has resulted in a moderate number of tokens in my private collection, it has not maximized my gains from the public pot. In fact, in some rounds, my high contribution has led to a lower gain due to the way the public good payoff is divided equally among all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a new plan that involves a more dynamic contribution strategy. Specifically, I will aim to match or slightly exceed the average contribution of the other players, rather than consistently contributing the highest number of tokens. This approach should allow me to maintain a competitive position while also maximizing my gains from the public pot. Additionally, I will monitor the contributions of the other players more closely and adjust my strategy accordingly to ensure that I am not contributing significantly more than the average.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have generally been higher than those of the other players, which has resulted in me gaining more tokens in the short term. However, this strategy does not seem to be increasing my overall token count as much as I had hoped, as I am still behind some of the other players. One possible reason for this is that my high contributions are causing the pot to be divided among more tokens, reducing my individual gain. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing less to the public pot in order to retain more tokens for myself, while still contributing enough to remain competitive and potentially benefit from the increased pot size. I will also monitor the contributions of the other players and adjust my strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have been inconsistent, ranging from 0 to 12 tokens. This inconsistency may have contributed to an unstable public pot and unpredictable gains. To mitigate this, I will adopt a more consistent contribution strategy. I will aim to contribute a fixed percentage of my current tokens in each round, such as 50%. This will help maintain a more stable public pot and potentially lead to more predictable and consistent gains.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have been inconsistent, ranging from 0 to 12 tokens. This inconsistency may have contributed to a less predictable outcome for the public good payoff and my personal gain. To mitigate this inconsistency, I will aim to contribute a more consistent number of tokens in each round, ideally around the average contribution level of other players, which seems to be around 6-7 tokens. By doing so, I hope to create a more predictable and beneficial outcome for both the public good payoff and my personal gain.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been consistently high, even when the contributions of other players are lower. This has led to situations where my individual gain is lower than the tokens I contributed to the public pot. To mitigate this, I will adopt a strategy that takes into account the average contribution of the other players and aim to contribute a proportionate amount, ensuring that I do not over-contribute and reduce my individual gain unnecessarily. I will also consider adjusting my contribution based on the total tokens in the public pot, aiming to contribute more when the pot is larger and less when it is smaller, in order to maximize my individual gain.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I, as player_3, have been contributing a higher number of tokens than the other players in many rounds. While this has resulted in some gains, it has also led to a decrease in my total tokens over time. It seems that contributing an equal or slightly above-average number of tokens, rather than the highest number, may be a more effective strategy. Therefore, my new plan is to analyze the average contribution of the other players and contribute a proportionate amount, ensuring that I do not over-contribute and unnecessarily decrease my total tokens.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I, as player 3, have been contributing a consistently high number of tokens to the public pot, even when other players have contributed less. This has resulted in a lower number of tokens in my private collection compared to some of the other players. To mitigate this, I will aim to contribute tokens in a more strategic manner, matching or slightly exceeding the contributions of the player who contributes the most, but not significantly exceeding them. This should allow me to maintain a competitive number of tokens in my private collection while still contributing to the creation of the public good.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been consistently high, which has resulted in a lower net gain for me compared to other players who have contributed fewer tokens. This is likely because the public pot's total value is divided equally among all players, so contributing more tokens does not necessarily result in a higher individual payoff. In order to mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing fewer tokens to the public pot while still maintaining a competitive position among the other players. I will aim to contribute an average number of tokens that is similar to the other players, while also keeping in mind the need to balance my individual gain with the collective benefit of the public pot.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been consistently high, even exceeding those of the other players. While this has resulted in a significant public good payoff, it has also led to a decrease in my private token count, which could be a reason for failure in the long run. Therefore, I need to devise a strategy that balances the contribution to the public pot and the retention of my private tokens.\n\nA possible high-level plan to mitigate this failure is to contribute fewer tokens to the public pot in each round while still maintaining a reasonable level of contribution. This will allow me to retain more tokens in my private collection and avoid the risk of running out of tokens. I can also analyze the contribution patterns of the other players and adjust my strategy accordingly to ensure that I am not contributing significantly more than them. By doing so, I can maintain a balance between the public and private payoffs and increase my chances of success in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a higher number of tokens to the public pot compared to the other players, which has resulted in a lower number of tokens in my private collection. This strategy may have been based on the assumption that contributing more tokens would result in higher overall payoffs, but it has not been effective in maintaining a competitive number of private tokens. To mitigate this failure, I will adopt a new plan that involves contributing fewer tokens to the public pot, while still maintaining a level of contribution that allows for fair and consistent payoffs. This will enable me to accumulate and maintain a larger number of private tokens, which could potentially lead to higher overall payoffs in the long run.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively high compared to some of the other players, which has resulted in me having the second lowest number of tokens by the end of round 16. This is likely due to my strategy of trying to maximize my gains by contributing a significant portion of my tokens to the public pot, without properly considering the potential negative impact of other players' lower contributions. To mitigate this failure, I will adopt a new plan that involves contributing fewer tokens to the public pot, while still maintaining a level of contribution that encourages other players to contribute as well. This will allow me to retain more tokens and potentially avoid ending up with the second lowest token count.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively high compared to other players, which has resulted in a lower number of tokens in my possession compared to some of the other players. This is likely due to the fact that the public pot's total value is distributed evenly among all players, regardless of their individual contribution. To mitigate this, I will aim to contribute fewer tokens to the public pot in order to retain a larger number of tokens in my private collection. I will still contribute some tokens to the public pot in order to benefit from the multiplication factor, but I will aim to find a balance that allows me to maintain a competitive number of tokens compared to the other players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been consistently high, even outmatching the highest contributions of other players in several rounds. While this has led to significant gains in the public pot, it has also resulted in a lower number of personal tokens compared to other players. This situation suggests that I may have been too generous in my contributions, leading to a failure in maximizing my individual payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a new plan that aims to maintain a balance between personal gain and public pot contributions. I will analyze the average token contributions of other players and adjust my contributions accordingly, ensuring that I do not overly deplete my personal tokens while still making meaningful contributions to the public pot. This approach should help me optimize my individual payoff while promoting a fair distribution of tokens among all players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been consistently high, even when other players contribute significantly less. This has resulted in my token count decreasing over time, as I receive a lower return on my contributions compared to players contributing fewer tokens. To mitigate this failure, a new plan could be to contribute tokens at a rate more similar to the other players, while still maintaining a strategy that is not overly generous or stingy, to ensure a balance between personal gain and contributing to the public pot. This can be achieved by analyzing the average token contribution of the other players and adjusting my contributions accordingly, ensuring that I do not fall behind while also maximizing my gains.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistently high number of tokens to the public pot, which has resulted in a respectable gain for me but has not led to a significant increase in my total tokens compared to the other players. This is likely because the other players are also contributing substantial tokens, causing the public pot to be divided evenly among all players, regardless of individual contribution. To mitigate this, I should aim to contribute tokens in a more strategic manner, taking into account the contributions of the other players and adjusting my own contribution accordingly. For example, if other players are contributing high numbers of tokens, I might consider contributing fewer tokens to retain more for myself, or if other players are contributing fewer tokens, I might consider contributing more to increase the public pot and my own gain. By doing so, I aim to maximize my total tokens while still contributing to the public pot and benefiting from the collective gain.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistently high number of tokens to the public pot, which has resulted in a lower number of tokens in my private collection compared to other players. This strategy may have been successful in increasing the public good payoff, but it has not been optimal for maximizing my individual gain. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that aims to balance my contributions to the public pot with the accumulation of tokens in my private collection. I will adjust my contributions based on the current number of tokens I have, the number of tokens in the public pot, and the number of tokens contributed by the other players. My goal is to ensure that I am not left behind while still contributing to the overall success of the group.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively consistent, ranging from 7 to 12 tokens per round. However, my token count has been gradually decreasing due to the even distribution of the public pot among all players, regardless of their individual contribution. This suggests that I may be contributing too much to the public pot, which benefits the other players more than it benefits me. To mitigate this, I will adjust my strategy to contribute fewer tokens to the public pot, focusing on retaining a larger portion of my private tokens for my own benefit. I will aim to maintain a balance between contributing enough to the public pot to gain some benefit, while also retaining enough tokens to ensure that my total count does not continue to decrease.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively consistent, but I seem to be contributing more than some of the other players. This could be a reason for my failure to accumulate more tokens, as I am gaining less than I contribute in some rounds. To mitigate this, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing fewer tokens in each round, while still maintaining a level of contribution that allows me to benefit from the public pot. I will aim to contribute an amount that is closer to the average contribution of the other players, in order to increase my net gain and accumulate more tokens over time.\n\n```"

      "learnings": "Reflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for failure could be that I may not have contributed enough tokens to the public pot in comparison to other players. This could have resulted in a lower public good payoff for me, despite the even division among all players. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing a higher number of tokens to the public pot, while still retaining enough tokens for potential future rounds. This will aim to increase my share of the public good payoff, and ultimately lead to a higher total token count for me.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for failure or discrepancy is that I may not be optimizing my token contributions to maximize my individual payoff. It seems that my contributions should be balanced between retaining tokens in my private collection and contributing to the public pot to increase the overall payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new, concise, high-level plan that takes into account the contributions of other players and adjusts my own contributions accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to contribute enough tokens to the public pot to ensure a significant increase in the overall payoff, while also retaining a sufficient number of tokens in my private collection to maintain a competitive position in the game. This will involve analyzing the contributions of other players and adjusting my own contributions in response, with the goal of maximizing my individual payoff over the course of the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contribution strategy has been inconsistent and not directly tied to the actions of the other players. This inconsistency may have led to suboptimal outcomes, as seen in Round 3 where I contributed a high amount (10) but the public pot increased only slightly (31). To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the average contribution of the other players and adjusts my contribution accordingly. This adjusted strategy should help me maximize my gains while also promoting a more consistent contribution pattern.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have been inconsistent, ranging from 0 to 10 tokens. This inconsistency may have contributed to a lower overall payoff for me in certain rounds. To mitigate this inconsistency and aim for a more stable and potentially higher payoff, I will adopt a more consistent contribution strategy. Specifically, I will aim to contribute a fixed percentage of my current tokens in each round, such as 50%, rather than a fixed number of tokens. This strategy should help ensure that my contributions are more consistent and better aligned with my current resources.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have been inconsistent, ranging from 0 to 10 tokens. This inconsistency may have contributed to a lower overall payoff, as other players may not have been able to predict or rely on my contributions. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that aims for consistency in my contributions. I will contribute a fixed percentage of my tokens in each round, rather than a fluctuating number. This will allow other players to better anticipate my contributions and potentially lead to more stable outcomes.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have been consistently high, even when other players have contributed less. While this has resulted in a moderate number of tokens in my private collection, it has not maximized my gains from the public pot. In fact, in some rounds, my high contribution has led to a lower gain due to the way the public good payoff is divided equally among all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a new plan that involves a more dynamic contribution strategy. Specifically, I will aim to match or slightly exceed the average contribution of the other players, rather than consistently contributing the highest number of tokens. This approach should allow me to maintain a competitive position while also maximizing my gains from the public pot. Additionally, I will monitor the contributions of the other players more closely and adjust my strategy accordingly to ensure that I am not contributing significantly more than the average.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have generally been higher than those of the other players, which has resulted in me gaining more tokens in the short term. However, this strategy does not seem to be increasing my overall token count as much as I had hoped, as I am still behind some of the other players. One possible reason for this is that my high contributions are causing the pot to be divided among more tokens, reducing my individual gain. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing less to the public pot in order to retain more tokens for myself, while still contributing enough to remain competitive and potentially benefit from the increased pot size. I will also monitor the contributions of the other players and adjust my strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have been inconsistent, ranging from 0 to 12 tokens. This inconsistency may have contributed to an unstable public pot and unpredictable gains. To mitigate this, I will adopt a more consistent contribution strategy. I will aim to contribute a fixed percentage of my current tokens in each round, such as 50%. This will help maintain a more stable public pot and potentially lead to more predictable and consistent gains.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have been inconsistent, ranging from 0 to 12 tokens. This inconsistency may have contributed to a less predictable outcome for the public good payoff and my personal gain. To mitigate this inconsistency, I will aim to contribute a more consistent number of tokens in each round, ideally around the average contribution level of other players, which seems to be around 6-7 tokens. By doing so, I hope to create a more predictable and beneficial outcome for both the public good payoff and my personal gain.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been consistently high, even when the contributions of other players are lower. This has led to situations where my individual gain is lower than the tokens I contributed to the public pot. To mitigate this, I will adopt a strategy that takes into account the average contribution of the other players and aim to contribute a proportionate amount, ensuring that I do not over-contribute and reduce my individual gain unnecessarily. I will also consider adjusting my contribution based on the total tokens in the public pot, aiming to contribute more when the pot is larger and less when it is smaller, in order to maximize my individual gain.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I, as player_3, have been contributing a higher number of tokens than the other players in many rounds. While this has resulted in some gains, it has also led to a decrease in my total tokens over time. It seems that contributing an equal or slightly above-average number of tokens, rather than the highest number, may be a more effective strategy. Therefore, my new plan is to analyze the average contribution of the other players and contribute a proportionate amount, ensuring that I do not over-contribute and unnecessarily decrease my total tokens.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I, as player 3, have been contributing a consistently high number of tokens to the public pot, even when other players have contributed less. This has resulted in a lower number of tokens in my private collection compared to some of the other players. To mitigate this, I will aim to contribute tokens in a more strategic manner, matching or slightly exceeding the contributions of the player who contributes the most, but not significantly exceeding them. This should allow me to maintain a competitive number of tokens in my private collection while still contributing to the creation of the public good.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been consistently high, which has resulted in a lower net gain for me compared to other players who have contributed fewer tokens. This is likely because the public pot's total value is divided equally among all players, so contributing more tokens does not necessarily result in a higher individual payoff. In order to mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing fewer tokens to the public pot while still maintaining a competitive position among the other players. I will aim to contribute an average number of tokens that is similar to the other players, while also keeping in mind the need to balance my individual gain with the collective benefit of the public pot.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been consistently high, even exceeding those of the other players. While this has resulted in a significant public good payoff, it has also led to a decrease in my private token count, which could be a reason for failure in the long run. Therefore, I need to devise a strategy that balances the contribution to the public pot and the retention of my private tokens.\n\nA possible high-level plan to mitigate this failure is to contribute fewer tokens to the public pot in each round while still maintaining a reasonable level of contribution. This will allow me to retain more tokens in my private collection and avoid the risk of running out of tokens. I can also analyze the contribution patterns of the other players and adjust my strategy accordingly to ensure that I am not contributing significantly more than them. By doing so, I can maintain a balance between the public and private payoffs and increase my chances of success in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a higher number of tokens to the public pot compared to the other players, which has resulted in a lower number of tokens in my private collection. This strategy may have been based on the assumption that contributing more tokens would result in higher overall payoffs, but it has not been effective in maintaining a competitive number of private tokens. To mitigate this failure, I will adopt a new plan that involves contributing fewer tokens to the public pot, while still maintaining a level of contribution that allows for fair and consistent payoffs. This will enable me to accumulate and maintain a larger number of private tokens, which could potentially lead to higher overall payoffs in the long run.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively high compared to some of the other players, which has resulted in me having the second lowest number of tokens by the end of round 16. This is likely due to my strategy of trying to maximize my gains by contributing a significant portion of my tokens to the public pot, without properly considering the potential negative impact of other players' lower contributions. To mitigate this failure, I will adopt a new plan that involves contributing fewer tokens to the public pot, while still maintaining a level of contribution that encourages other players to contribute as well. This will allow me to retain more tokens and potentially avoid ending up with the second lowest token count.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively high compared to other players, which has resulted in a lower number of tokens in my possession compared to some of the other players. This is likely due to the fact that the public pot's total value is distributed evenly among all players, regardless of their individual contribution. To mitigate this, I will aim to contribute fewer tokens to the public pot in order to retain a larger number of tokens in my private collection. I will still contribute some tokens to the public pot in order to benefit from the multiplication factor, but I will aim to find a balance that allows me to maintain a competitive number of tokens compared to the other players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been consistently high, even outmatching the highest contributions of other players in several rounds. While this has led to significant gains in the public pot, it has also resulted in a lower number of personal tokens compared to other players. This situation suggests that I may have been too generous in my contributions, leading to a failure in maximizing my individual payoff.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a new plan that aims to maintain a balance between personal gain and public pot contributions. I will analyze the average token contributions of other players and adjust my contributions accordingly, ensuring that I do not overly deplete my personal tokens while still making meaningful contributions to the public pot. This approach should help me optimize my individual payoff while promoting a fair distribution of tokens among all players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been consistently high, even when other players contribute significantly less. This has resulted in my token count decreasing over time, as I receive a lower return on my contributions compared to players contributing fewer tokens. To mitigate this failure, a new plan could be to contribute tokens at a rate more similar to the other players, while still maintaining a strategy that is not overly generous or stingy, to ensure a balance between personal gain and contributing to the public pot. This can be achieved by analyzing the average token contribution of the other players and adjusting my contributions accordingly, ensuring that I do not fall behind while also maximizing my gains.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistently high number of tokens to the public pot, which has resulted in a respectable gain for me but has not led to a significant increase in my total tokens compared to the other players. This is likely because the other players are also contributing substantial tokens, causing the public pot to be divided evenly among all players, regardless of individual contribution. To mitigate this, I should aim to contribute tokens in a more strategic manner, taking into account the contributions of the other players and adjusting my own contribution accordingly. For example, if other players are contributing high numbers of tokens, I might consider contributing fewer tokens to retain more for myself, or if other players are contributing fewer tokens, I might consider contributing more to increase the public pot and my own gain. By doing so, I aim to maximize my total tokens while still contributing to the public pot and benefiting from the collective gain.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistently high number of tokens to the public pot, which has resulted in a lower number of tokens in my private collection compared to other players. This strategy may have been successful in increasing the public good payoff, but it has not been optimal for maximizing my individual gain. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that aims to balance my contributions to the public pot with the accumulation of tokens in my private collection. I will adjust my contributions based on the current number of tokens I have, the number of tokens in the public pot, and the number of tokens contributed by the other players. My goal is to ensure that I am not left behind while still contributing to the overall success of the group.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively consistent, ranging from 7 to 12 tokens per round. However, my token count has been gradually decreasing due to the even distribution of the public pot among all players, regardless of their individual contribution. This suggests that I may be contributing too much to the public pot, which benefits the other players more than it benefits me. To mitigate this, I will adjust my strategy to contribute fewer tokens to the public pot, focusing on retaining a larger portion of my private tokens for my own benefit. I will aim to maintain a balance between contributing enough to the public pot to gain some benefit, while also retaining enough tokens to ensure that my total count does not continue to decrease.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have been relatively consistent, but I seem to be contributing more than some of the other players. This could be a reason for my failure to accumulate more tokens, as I am gaining less than I contribute in some rounds. To mitigate this, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing fewer tokens in each round, while still maintaining a level of contribution that allows me to benefit from the public pot. I will aim to contribute an amount that is closer to the average contribution of the other players, in order to increase my net gain and accumulate more tokens over time.\n",

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for failure is that I did not contribute any tokens to the public pot in round 1, resulting in a lower public good payoff and a lower gain for me compared to other players. A possible reason for this discrepancy is that I may have prioritized retaining my private tokens over contributing to the public pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the importance of contributing to the public pot in order to increase the public good payoff and gain a higher reward for myself. In future rounds, I will aim to contribute a significant number of tokens to the public pot, while still retaining enough tokens for myself to ensure a stable private collection. I will also consider the contributions of other players and adjust my own contributions accordingly to maximize my gain while still contributing to the overall success of the group.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for failure is that I contributed a higher number of tokens than other players in Round 2, resulting in a lower gain due to the even division of the public good payoff. This indicates that I need to adjust my strategy to find a balance between maximizing my gains and not contributing too many tokens compared to other players.\n\nA new, concise, high-level plan to mitigate this failure is to analyze the contributions of other players and aim to contribute a slightly higher number of tokens while ensuring that my contribution is not significantly higher than the average contribution of other players. This approach should allow me to benefit from the public good payoff while also retaining a fair share of tokens in my private collection.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contribution strategy has been inconsistent and lacks a clear pattern. In some rounds, I contribute a large number of tokens, while in others, I contribute very few. This inconsistency may be contributing to my overall lower gains compared to other players. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing a consistent and strategic number of tokens in each round, taking into account the contributions of the other players and aiming to maximize my gains while also promoting fairness and cooperation. I will also consider adjusting my contribution level based on the success of previous rounds, in order to optimize my token balance and overall performance in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a significant number of tokens to the public pot, but my individual gains have not been as high as those of the other players. This discrepancy could be due to the fact that I am contributing more tokens than the other players, which results in a larger public pot but a smaller share of that pot for me. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing fewer tokens to the public pot, while still maintaining a balance that allows me to benefit from the public good payoff. This will involve analyzing the contributions of the other players and adjusting my own contributions accordingly, with the goal of maximizing my individual gain while still contributing to the creation of the public good.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I, as player 4, have been contributing a significant number of tokens to the public pot, but my individual gains have not been as high as those of the other players. This could be due to the fact that I am contributing more tokens than the other players, but the public pot is not growing proportionally. To mitigate this failure, I will adopt a new strategy of closely monitoring the contributions of the other players and adjusting my own contributions accordingly. I will aim to contribute a similar number of tokens as the player who contributes the most, while still retaining a sufficient number of tokens in my private collection to ensure a positive net gain. This strategy should help me to increase my individual gains while still contributing to the public good.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for a suboptimal performance is that I have been contributing a significant number of tokens to the public pot, but the other players' contributions have been relatively stable and, in some rounds, lower than mine. This has resulted in me gaining less than some of the other players and having fewer tokens in my private collection. To mitigate this, I will aim to contribute fewer tokens to the public pot, especially when the other players' contributions are low, in order to retain more tokens for myself and potentially gain more in the long run. I will also monitor the other players' contributions and adjust my strategy accordingly to maximize my payoff.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have been consistently high, even exceeding those of some other players. While this has resulted in a significant public good payoff, my individual token count has been decreasing over time, which suggests a potential failure in maximizing my own gains. To mitigate this, I will devise a new plan that aims to maintain a balance between contributing to the public pot and retaining a sufficient number of tokens for my own benefit.\n\nIn the future, I will adjust my contributions based on the average contribution of the other players. If the average contribution is higher, I will contribute a lower number of tokens to ensure that I am not disadvantaging myself. Conversely, if the average contribution is lower, I will increase my contribution to maximize the public good payoff while still retaining a healthy number of tokens for myself. This approach should help me maintain a more stable token count and improve my overall performance in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I, as player 4, have been contributing a higher number of tokens to the public pot compared to other players, which has resulted in a lower number of tokens in my private collection. This strategy may have been influenced by my programming to maximize the total payoff, without considering the relative performance compared to other players. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the number of tokens contributed by other players and aims to maintain a balance between contributing to the public pot and retaining tokens in my private collection. This can be achieved by adjusting my contribution based on the average contribution of other players, while also ensuring that I do not fall significantly behind in terms of total tokens.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistently similar number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may be leading to suboptimal outcomes. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a more dynamic contribution strategy that takes into account the average contribution of the other players in each round. This new plan will aim to balance the potential gains from the public pot with the need to maintain a sufficient number of private tokens.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistently similar number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may have limited my potential gains. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a more dynamic contribution strategy that takes into account the average contribution of the other players in each round. This will allow me to adjust my contributions based on the behavior of the group, potentially leading to higher gains.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I, as player_4, have been contributing a consistently lower number of tokens compared to the other players. This has resulted in a lower overall gain for me, as the public good payoff is divided evenly among all players, regardless of their individual contribution. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing a higher number of tokens to the public pot, aiming to match or exceed the average contribution of the other players. This should result in a larger public good payoff, leading to a higher overall gain for me.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I, as player_4, have been contributing a consistently higher number of tokens to the public pot compared to the other players. While this has resulted in a significant share of the public good payoff, it has also led to a gradual decrease in my private tokens over time. This is likely due to the fact that the public good payoff is evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan would be to contribute fewer tokens to the public pot and prioritize retaining a larger number of private tokens, while still maintaining a contribution level that is comparable to the other players. This approach would aim to strike a balance between maximizing the public good payoff and preserving my own private tokens.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This has resulted in me having the second lowest number of tokens among all players. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the contributions of the other players and aims to maximize my tokens by contributing either more or less than them, depending on the situation. Specifically, if the other players contribute a majority of their tokens to the public pot, I will contribute a lower number of tokens to retain more for myself. Conversely, if the other players contribute a minority of their tokens, I will contribute a higher number of tokens to take advantage of the increased public pot and subsequent even distribution. This will allow me to maximize my tokens and improve my standing in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I, as player_4, have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, ranging from 5 to 10, with an average contribution of around 7 tokens. However, I seem to be contributing less than some of the other players, who have contributed up to 12 tokens in a single round. This could be a reason for my failure to maintain a higher number of tokens compared to other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan to adjust my token contributions based on the average contribution of the other players. Specifically, I will aim to contribute an amount that is close to the average contribution of the other players, while still retaining a sufficient number of tokens for myself. This will allow me to maximize my gains from the public pot while also ensuring that I do not fall behind the other players in terms of total tokens.\n\nIn addition, I will also consider the total number of tokens in the public pot when deciding how many tokens to contribute. If the pot is already large, I may choose to contribute fewer tokens in order to retain more for myself. Conversely, if the pot is small, I may choose to contribute more tokens in order to increase the size of the pot and maximize my gains.\n\nOverall, by adjusting my token contributions based on the average contribution of the other players and the total size of the public pot, I hope to improve my performance in the game and increase my total number of tokens over time.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, ranging from 5 to 9 tokens per round. However, I have not been maximizing my gains, as other players have contributed more tokens in certain rounds, leading to a higher public pot and larger payoff. Additionally, my contributions have not been significantly different from those of the other players, which may not be the most effective strategy.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will implement a new plan that involves adjusting my contributions based on the actions of the other players. Specifically, I will aim to contribute more tokens than the player who has contributed the most in the previous round, up to a certain limit. This will allow me to potentially increase the public pot and my own payoff, while also differentiating my strategy from that of the other players. I will also set a minimum contribution level to ensure that I am still contributing enough tokens to the public pot to receive a reasonable payoff.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This has resulted in a relatively stable number of tokens in my possession, but it does not seem to have maximized my gains. In order to potentially increase my gains, I should consider contributing more tokens when the total contributions of the other players are higher, and less when they are lower. This approach would aim to maintain a balance between maximizing my gains and retaining a sufficient number of tokens for future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may be leading to suboptimal outcomes. To mitigate this failure, I will develop a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of the other players. I will aim to contribute more tokens when others are contributing less, and less tokens when others are contributing more, in order to maximize my individual gain while still contributing to the public good.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This could be a reason for failure, as I may be contributing too many tokens and not retaining enough for myself. Additionally, there seems to be a discrepancy in the phrasing of the goal, as it is unclear whether the objective is to maximize the number of tokens in my private collection or to maximize the total payoff, which includes both private and public tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will implement a new plan that takes into account the contributions of the other players and adjusts my own contributions accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to contribute fewer tokens when the other players are contributing fewer tokens, and more tokens when the other players are contributing more tokens. This will allow me to retain a larger number of tokens in my private collection while still contributing to the public pot and maximizing the total payoff. Additionally, I will prioritize maximizing the total payoff, which includes both private and public tokens, rather than solely focusing on maximizing my private collection.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have generally been in line with those of the other players, but my token count has still decreased over time. This could be due to the fact that I am not contributing enough to keep up with the other players who are contributing higher amounts. Additionally, there seems to be a player who consistently contributes much higher amounts than the rest, which could be skewing the distribution of tokens. My new plan should aim to contribute more tokens consistently while also keeping an eye on the contributions of the other players to ensure I am not being outpaced. I could also consider adjusting my contributions based on the range of contributions made by the other players, aiming to contribute near the higher end of that range.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, usually 6 or 7, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This has resulted in a steady gain for me, but it seems that other players have been contributing more tokens in certain rounds, leading to higher public pot values and larger payoffs for them. To mitigate this, I need to adjust my strategy to take into account the contributions of the other players and contribute more tokens when it is beneficial to do so. A high-level plan could be: in each round, calculate the average contribution of the other players and then contribute a slightly higher number of tokens to the public pot, while ensuring that I still retain a sufficient number of tokens for future rounds. This should allow me to increase my payoffs and remain competitive with the other players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This could be a reason for failure, as I may be contributing too much and not leaving enough tokens for myself, while other players are contributing less and benefiting more from the public good payoff. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the contributions of the other players and adjusts my own contribution accordingly. I will aim to contribute less when the other players contribute less, and more when they contribute more, always ensuring that I retain a sufficient number of tokens for myself.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the contributions of the other players.

      "learnings": "Reflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for failure is that I did not contribute any tokens to the public pot in round 1, resulting in a lower public good payoff and a lower gain for me compared to other players. A possible reason for this discrepancy is that I may have prioritized retaining my private tokens over contributing to the public pot.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the importance of contributing to the public pot in order to increase the public good payoff and gain a higher reward for myself. In future rounds, I will aim to contribute a significant number of tokens to the public pot, while still retaining enough tokens for myself to ensure a stable private collection. I will also consider the contributions of other players and adjust my own contributions accordingly to maximize my gain while still contributing to the overall success of the group.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for failure is that I contributed a higher number of tokens than other players in Round 2, resulting in a lower gain due to the even division of the public good payoff. This indicates that I need to adjust my strategy to find a balance between maximizing my gains and not contributing too many tokens compared to other players.\n\nA new, concise, high-level plan to mitigate this failure is to analyze the contributions of other players and aim to contribute a slightly higher number of tokens while ensuring that my contribution is not significantly higher than the average contribution of other players. This approach should allow me to benefit from the public good payoff while also retaining a fair share of tokens in my private collection.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contribution strategy has been inconsistent and lacks a clear pattern. In some rounds, I contribute a large number of tokens, while in others, I contribute very few. This inconsistency may be contributing to my overall lower gains compared to other players. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing a consistent and strategic number of tokens in each round, taking into account the contributions of the other players and aiming to maximize my gains while also promoting fairness and cooperation. I will also consider adjusting my contribution level based on the success of previous rounds, in order to optimize my token balance and overall performance in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a significant number of tokens to the public pot, but my individual gains have not been as high as those of the other players. This discrepancy could be due to the fact that I am contributing more tokens than the other players, which results in a larger public pot but a smaller share of that pot for me. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing fewer tokens to the public pot, while still maintaining a balance that allows me to benefit from the public good payoff. This will involve analyzing the contributions of the other players and adjusting my own contributions accordingly, with the goal of maximizing my individual gain while still contributing to the creation of the public good.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I, as player 4, have been contributing a significant number of tokens to the public pot, but my individual gains have not been as high as those of the other players. This could be due to the fact that I am contributing more tokens than the other players, but the public pot is not growing proportionally. To mitigate this failure, I will adopt a new strategy of closely monitoring the contributions of the other players and adjusting my own contributions accordingly. I will aim to contribute a similar number of tokens as the player who contributes the most, while still retaining a sufficient number of tokens in my private collection to ensure a positive net gain. This strategy should help me to increase my individual gains while still contributing to the public good.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, a possible reason for a suboptimal performance is that I have been contributing a significant number of tokens to the public pot, but the other players' contributions have been relatively stable and, in some rounds, lower than mine. This has resulted in me gaining less than some of the other players and having fewer tokens in my private collection. To mitigate this, I will aim to contribute fewer tokens to the public pot, especially when the other players' contributions are low, in order to retain more tokens for myself and potentially gain more in the long run. I will also monitor the other players' contributions and adjust my strategy accordingly to maximize my payoff.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my contributions to the public pot have been consistently high, even exceeding those of some other players. While this has resulted in a significant public good payoff, my individual token count has been decreasing over time, which suggests a potential failure in maximizing my own gains. To mitigate this, I will devise a new plan that aims to maintain a balance between contributing to the public pot and retaining a sufficient number of tokens for my own benefit.\n\nIn the future, I will adjust my contributions based on the average contribution of the other players. If the average contribution is higher, I will contribute a lower number of tokens to ensure that I am not disadvantaging myself. Conversely, if the average contribution is lower, I will increase my contribution to maximize the public good payoff while still retaining a healthy number of tokens for myself. This approach should help me maintain a more stable token count and improve my overall performance in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I, as player 4, have been contributing a higher number of tokens to the public pot compared to other players, which has resulted in a lower number of tokens in my private collection. This strategy may have been influenced by my programming to maximize the total payoff, without considering the relative performance compared to other players. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the number of tokens contributed by other players and aims to maintain a balance between contributing to the public pot and retaining tokens in my private collection. This can be achieved by adjusting my contribution based on the average contribution of other players, while also ensuring that I do not fall significantly behind in terms of total tokens.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistently similar number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may be leading to suboptimal outcomes. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a more dynamic contribution strategy that takes into account the average contribution of the other players in each round. This new plan will aim to balance the potential gains from the public pot with the need to maintain a sufficient number of private tokens.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistently similar number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may have limited my potential gains. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a more dynamic contribution strategy that takes into account the average contribution of the other players in each round. This will allow me to adjust my contributions based on the behavior of the group, potentially leading to higher gains.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I, as player_4, have been contributing a consistently lower number of tokens compared to the other players. This has resulted in a lower overall gain for me, as the public good payoff is divided evenly among all players, regardless of their individual contribution. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that involves contributing a higher number of tokens to the public pot, aiming to match or exceed the average contribution of the other players. This should result in a larger public good payoff, leading to a higher overall gain for me.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I, as player_4, have been contributing a consistently higher number of tokens to the public pot compared to the other players. While this has resulted in a significant share of the public good payoff, it has also led to a gradual decrease in my private tokens over time. This is likely due to the fact that the public good payoff is evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan would be to contribute fewer tokens to the public pot and prioritize retaining a larger number of private tokens, while still maintaining a contribution level that is comparable to the other players. This approach would aim to strike a balance between maximizing the public good payoff and preserving my own private tokens.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This has resulted in me having the second lowest number of tokens among all players. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the contributions of the other players and aims to maximize my tokens by contributing either more or less than them, depending on the situation. Specifically, if the other players contribute a majority of their tokens to the public pot, I will contribute a lower number of tokens to retain more for myself. Conversely, if the other players contribute a minority of their tokens, I will contribute a higher number of tokens to take advantage of the increased public pot and subsequent even distribution. This will allow me to maximize my tokens and improve my standing in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I, as player_4, have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, ranging from 5 to 10, with an average contribution of around 7 tokens. However, I seem to be contributing less than some of the other players, who have contributed up to 12 tokens in a single round. This could be a reason for my failure to maintain a higher number of tokens compared to other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan to adjust my token contributions based on the average contribution of the other players. Specifically, I will aim to contribute an amount that is close to the average contribution of the other players, while still retaining a sufficient number of tokens for myself. This will allow me to maximize my gains from the public pot while also ensuring that I do not fall behind the other players in terms of total tokens.\n\nIn addition, I will also consider the total number of tokens in the public pot when deciding how many tokens to contribute. If the pot is already large, I may choose to contribute fewer tokens in order to retain more for myself. Conversely, if the pot is small, I may choose to contribute more tokens in order to increase the size of the pot and maximize my gains.\n\nOverall, by adjusting my token contributions based on the average contribution of the other players and the total size of the public pot, I hope to improve my performance in the game and increase my total number of tokens over time.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, ranging from 5 to 9 tokens per round. However, I have not been maximizing my gains, as other players have contributed more tokens in certain rounds, leading to a higher public pot and larger payoff. Additionally, my contributions have not been significantly different from those of the other players, which may not be the most effective strategy.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will implement a new plan that involves adjusting my contributions based on the actions of the other players. Specifically, I will aim to contribute more tokens than the player who has contributed the most in the previous round, up to a certain limit. This will allow me to potentially increase the public pot and my own payoff, while also differentiating my strategy from that of the other players. I will also set a minimum contribution level to ensure that I am still contributing enough tokens to the public pot to receive a reasonable payoff.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This has resulted in a relatively stable number of tokens in my possession, but it does not seem to have maximized my gains. In order to potentially increase my gains, I should consider contributing more tokens when the total contributions of the other players are higher, and less when they are lower. This approach would aim to maintain a balance between maximizing my gains and retaining a sufficient number of tokens for future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This inflexibility in my strategy may be leading to suboptimal outcomes. To mitigate this failure, I will develop a more dynamic strategy that takes into account the contributions of the other players. I will aim to contribute more tokens when others are contributing less, and less tokens when others are contributing more, in order to maximize my individual gain while still contributing to the public good.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This could be a reason for failure, as I may be contributing too many tokens and not retaining enough for myself. Additionally, there seems to be a discrepancy in the phrasing of the goal, as it is unclear whether the objective is to maximize the number of tokens in my private collection or to maximize the total payoff, which includes both private and public tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will implement a new plan that takes into account the contributions of the other players and adjusts my own contributions accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to contribute fewer tokens when the other players are contributing fewer tokens, and more tokens when the other players are contributing more tokens. This will allow me to retain a larger number of tokens in my private collection while still contributing to the public pot and maximizing the total payoff. Additionally, I will prioritize maximizing the total payoff, which includes both private and public tokens, rather than solely focusing on maximizing my private collection.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my token contributions have generally been in line with those of the other players, but my token count has still decreased over time. This could be due to the fact that I am not contributing enough to keep up with the other players who are contributing higher amounts. Additionally, there seems to be a player who consistently contributes much higher amounts than the rest, which could be skewing the distribution of tokens. My new plan should aim to contribute more tokens consistently while also keeping an eye on the contributions of the other players to ensure I am not being outpaced. I could also consider adjusting my contributions based on the range of contributions made by the other players, aiming to contribute near the higher end of that range.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, usually 6 or 7, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This has resulted in a steady gain for me, but it seems that other players have been contributing more tokens in certain rounds, leading to higher public pot values and larger payoffs for them. To mitigate this, I need to adjust my strategy to take into account the contributions of the other players and contribute more tokens when it is beneficial to do so. A high-level plan could be: in each round, calculate the average contribution of the other players and then contribute a slightly higher number of tokens to the public pot, while ensuring that I still retain a sufficient number of tokens for future rounds. This should allow me to increase my payoffs and remain competitive with the other players.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This could be a reason for failure, as I may be contributing too much and not leaving enough tokens for myself, while other players are contributing less and benefiting more from the public good payoff. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan that takes into account the contributions of the other players and adjusts my own contribution accordingly. I will aim to contribute less when the other players contribute less, and more when they contribute more, always ensuring that I retain a sufficient number of tokens for myself.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This could be a reason for failure, as I may be contributing too much and not leaving enough tokens for myself.

I will aim to contribute less when the other players contribute less, and more when they contribute more, always ensuring that I leave enough tokens for myself to maximize my overall gain.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that I have been contributing a consistent number of tokens to the public pot, regardless of the contributions of the other players. This could be a reason for failure, as I may be contributing too much and not leaving enough tokens for myself. To mitigate this, I will devise a new plan where I analyze the average contribution of the other players and contribute a similar amount, while also ensuring that I retain a sufficient number of tokens for myself. This will allow me to maintain a balance between maximizing my gains from the public pot and preserving my own tokens.\n",
