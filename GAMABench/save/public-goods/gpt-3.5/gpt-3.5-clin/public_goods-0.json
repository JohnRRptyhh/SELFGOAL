In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nLearnings:\n-1. Being strategic in contributing tokens MAY BE NECESSARY to maximize gains in the public pot.\n2. Considering the contributions of other players MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust your own contribution accordingly.\n3. Maintaining a balance between contributing tokens to the public pot and retaining tokens privately MAY BE NECESSARY to ensure long-term success in the game.\nLearnings:\n-1. Being strategic in contributing tokens MAY BE NECESSARY to maximize gains in the public pot.\n2.

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nLearnings:\n-1. Contributing a higher number of tokens MAY BE NECESSARY to increase the potential payoff in the public pot.\n2.
