In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Assess Long-Term Strategies: Evaluate the long-term strategies of each player based on their token accumulation. Players who have a steady increase in tokens over multiple rounds may have a more sustainable and successful strategy compared to those with fluctuating token levels.\n - Observe Long-term Behavior: Pay attention to the behavior of other players over multiple rounds to identify consistent strategies. Some players may consistently contribute a certain percentage of their tokens, while others may adjust their contributions based on their current accumulation.\n - Identify Inconsistent Contributions: Review the game log to identify rounds where players 2 and 4 made inconsistent contributions compared to other rounds. Inconsistent contributions could include significantly higher or lower contributions compared to their usual pattern.\n - Risk Management: Assess the potential risks associated with the inconsistent contributions of players 2 and 4. Determine the level of risk you are willing to take in each round and adjust your contributions accordingly to minimize the impact of their deviations on your overall token accumulation.\n - Long-term Risk Management: Consider the long-term implications of your contribution strategy. Evaluate the potential risks and rewards associated with different contribution levels over multiple rounds, aiming to maintain a balance between accumulating tokens and maximizing gains from the public pot.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

          "content": "\n\nYou are participating in a game played by 5 players over 40 rounds.\n\nGame Rules:\n\n1. In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Observation and adaptation: Pay close attention to how other players are responding to your contributions. If they are consistently contributing lower amounts, it may indicate caution or a lack of confidence. Adjust your contributions accordingly to maintain a balance between signaling confidence and not overly dominating the game.\n - Flexibility in signaling: Be prepared to adjust your signaling strategy based on the responses of other players. If you notice a shift in their contributions, consider adapting your own contributions to continue influencing the overall dynamics of the game.\n - Long-term signaling: Consider the long-term implications of your signaling strategy. Aim to maintain a consistent and balanced signaling approach to achieve the goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens by the end of the game while also influencing the behavior of other players.\n - Identify consistently fair players: Look for players who have consistently received a fair share of the public good payoff despite their contributions. These players may be considered as reliable and fair contributors to the group's success. Observing their strategies and behaviors can provide insights for your own decision-making in future rounds.\n - Monitor the collective payoff: Continuously monitor the collective payoff and the tokens of each player after each round to assess the effectiveness of the collaborative strategy. Adjust the strategy as needed based on the outcomes of each round.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Contribution Levels: It seems that consistently contributing 8 tokens in each round has resulted in relatively stable gains for player_3. This suggests that maintaining a consistent contribution level may lead to more predictable gains over time.\n - Identify competitive dynamics: Pay attention to the contribution levels of other players and how it relates to their gains. Look for any strategic patterns or behaviors that may be influencing the overall competitive dynamics of the game. This can help you adapt your contribution strategy in future rounds.\n - Evaluate risk and reward: Consider the potential risks and rewards of adjusting your contribution level based on the comparative analysis. Assess how your individual gains may be impacted by different contribution strategies and weigh the potential outcomes for each approach.\n - Individual Gains Analysis: Track how your individual gains evolve in relation to your contributions and the overall pot size. If your gains plateau or increase marginally despite increasing contributions, it may suggest that the point of diminishing returns has been reached.\n - Adapt to changing dynamics: Be prepared to adapt your contribution strategy based on the evolving average contribution of other players. If the average contribution shifts, be flexible in adjusting your own contributions to ensure a balanced approach while working towards your primary goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens by the end of the game.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Balance Individual Gain and Public Good: Strive to strike a balance between contributing enough tokens to the public pot to ensure a substantial public good payoff while also retaining a sufficient number of tokens in your private collection to meet the primary objective of accumulating more than 30 tokens by the end of the game.\n - Consider the potential gains: Player_4 should consider the potential gains from different contribution levels. Analyzing the gains from previous rounds can help in determining the most advantageous contribution strategy for future rounds.\n - Assess Contribution Strategies: Analyze the relationship between your own contributions and gains in each round. Determine if there is a correlation between the tokens contributed and the resulting gains. This can help in refining your contribution strategy for future rounds.\n - Adapt to game outcomes: Learn from the outcomes of each round and use this information to adapt your strategy. If certain contributions lead to higher gains or better outcomes, incorporate these insights into your decision-making for future rounds to optimize your token accumulation.\n - Identify strategic players: Identify players who consistently contribute a high or low number of tokens to the public pot. This can help you anticipate their potential contributions in the next round and adjust your own strategy accordingly.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "
