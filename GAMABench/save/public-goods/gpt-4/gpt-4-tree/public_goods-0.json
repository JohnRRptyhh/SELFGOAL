In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Assess Current Position: You currently have 21.4 tokens after round 21. To achieve your primary goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens, you need to gain at least 8.6 tokens in the remaining rounds.\n - Calculate Outcomes: Given that there are only a few rounds left, calculate the potential outcomes of your current strategy. Ensure that it will allow you to maintain or increase your token count, keeping in mind the goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens.\n - Maintain Flexibility: Be ready to change your contribution based on the actions of others. If you notice a trend where the public pot is being underfunded, consider contributing slightly more to ensure you still receive some public good payout.\n - Final Round Strategy: In the final round, players may change their behavior. Some might contribute nothing, hoping to free-ride on others' contributions. Others might contribute more, trying to maximize their final gain. Be cautious and assume a conservative approach.\n - Stay Focused on the Primary Objective: While the public good is important, your primary objective is to accumulate more than 30 tokens. Make decisions that prioritize this goal, even if it means contributing less to the public pot in certain rounds.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

        "36": "Stay Alert to Endgame Dynamics: In the last few rounds, players' strategies may change drastically as they push to reach their goals. Stay alert to these dynamics and be ready to adjust your contributions to either capitalize on others' contributions or to protect your own token count.",
        "37": "Evaluate Each Round Independently: While keeping the overall goal in mind, evaluate each round based on the current state of the game. Avoid sticking to a fixed contribution amount regardless of the changing circumstances.",
        "38": "Maintain Flexibility: Be ready to change your contribution based on the actions of others. If you notice a trend where the public pot is being underfunded, consider contributing slightly more to ensure you still receive some public good payout.",
        "39": "Opt for Consistency: If you are unsure about the other players' strategies, you might choose to consistently contribute 1 token, as this has been a common contribution amount and may be seen as a fair input by other players.",
        "40": "Consider Relative Standing: If there is any benefit to finishing with more tokens than other players, aim to adjust your contribution to ensure you are not at a disadvantage relative to others.",
        "41": "Risk Assessment: Since this is the last round, there is no future risk to mitigate by conserving tokens. You can afford to take a more aggressive or conservative approach based on your assessment of others' likely actions.",
        "42": "Assess the Status Quo: Recognize that players are tending towards contributing 1 or 2 tokens in recent rounds. This trend is likely to continue in the final round, given the risk-averse behavior as the game nears its end.",
        "43": "Maximize Personal Gain: Since the contributions to the public pot are low, the multiplier effect is less significant. Retain as many tokens as possible while still gaining from the public pot to inch closer to the goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens.",
        "44": "Consider Last-Minute Alliances: If communication is possible, consider forming a last-minute alliance to ensure a higher contribution to the public pot, which could benefit all involved parties.",
        "45": "Prepare for Opportunistic Moves: Be on the lookout for any players who might make a last-ditch effort to contribute more to the public pot in hopes of a larger share, which could disrupt the current equilibrium.",
        "46": "Assess Current Standing: Determine how many tokens you currently have and how many rounds are left. This will inform how aggressive you need to be with your contributions.",
        "47": "Calculate Required Gain: Work out the exact number of tokens you need to reach your goal and then calculate how many tokens you need to gain per round to meet that goal.",
        "48": "Secure Your Position: If you are close to your goal, it may be wise to play conservatively to secure your position rather than taking unnecessary risks.",
        "49": "Prepare for Unpredictability: While patterns can inform your strategy, be prepared for unexpected moves by other players. The final round could prompt unpredictable behavior as each player attempts to maximize their final position.",
        "50": "Predict Public Pot Outcome: If the pattern holds and each player contributes 1 or 2 tokens, the public pot will likely contain between 5 and 10 tokens. The doubled amount will be between 10 and 20 tokens, resulting in a gain of 2 to 4 tokens per player.",
        "51": "Observe Patterns: Based on previous rounds, contributing 1 token has been a consistent strategy with gains varying between 1.8 and 3.0 tokens, indicating a reasonable expectation of a similar gain in the final round.",
        "52": "Predict Others' Contributions: Given that other players have consistently contributed low amounts in recent rounds, it's likely they will continue this trend, resulting in a public pot that is not significantly larger than in previous rounds.",
        "53": "Estimate Final Token Count: By contributing 1 token and expecting a gain of 2.8 to 3.6 tokens, your final token count would be approximately 24.0 to 24.8 tokens.",
        "54": "Reflect on Strategy: After the game concludes, reflect on the strategies used, the patterns of other players, and how you might adjust your approach in future games to better achieve your goals.",
        "55": "Consider Risk of Non-Contribution: If you consider contributing nothing, you risk gaining nothing from the public pot if others also contribute low amounts. This could leave you with your current token count, which is not advantageous.",
        "56": "Monitor Others' Behavior: If possible, observe any indications of other players' intended contributions for the final round. If you sense a collective move towards higher contributions, you may consider adjusting your contribution slightly, but this is a high-risk move given your goal.",
        "57": "Predict the Final Pot Size: Based on previous rounds, estimate the likely size of the public pot. Use this to inform your decision on how many tokens to contribute.",
        "58": "Assess the Competition: Look at the patterns of other players' contributions. Most players have been contributing 1 or 2 tokens, with occasional contributions of 3 tokens. It's unlikely that they will drastically change their strategies in the final round, so you can plan your contribution accordingly.",
        "59": "Aim for a Middle Ground: Since you want to avoid last-minute risks, aim to contribute an amount that keeps you in the middle of the pack. This reduces the likelihood of being outbid by a large margin and losing out on the public good while also preventing you from falling to the bottom of the token rankings.",
        "60": "Monitor Your Token Threshold: You need to ensure that your final token count does not drop below the threshold of other players. Keep a close eye on the token counts of others and ensure that your final count keeps you safely above the lowest token holder.",
        "61": "Prepare for Possible Scenarios: Consider the best and worst-case scenarios based on your contribution and that of others. If you contribute 1 token and others contribute more, will you still be safe? If you contribute 2 tokens and others contribute less, how will that affect your final standing?",
        "62": "Final Round Focus: Since this is the last round, the primary goal is to end the game with a token count that is not the lowest. The exact number of tokens is less important than ensuring you are not at the bottom.",
        "63": "Stay Alert to Last-Minute Changes: While you are avoiding last-minute risks, be aware that other players might change their strategies in the final round. Be prepared to adapt if you notice any unexpected moves, but only within the conservative framework you've set for yourself.",
        "64": "Final Decision Making: Make your final contribution decision based on a combination of past patterns, your current token count, and the behavior you anticipate from other players in the last round.",
        "65": "Observe the Norm: Look at the average contribution of other players in recent rounds. If the group norm is around 1 or 2 tokens, align your contributions accordingly to maintain group cohesion.",
        "66": "Subtle Adjustments: If you decide to change your contribution amount, do so by only one token at a time. This minimizes the perception of drastic change and is less likely to disrupt the established group dynamic.",
        "67": "Strategic Increment: If you are slightly behind your goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens, consider contributing one token less than the average group contribution, if it's higher than your usual, to slowly increase your private reserve without drawing too much attention.",
        "68": "Reciprocity: If you notice that other players are consistently contributing more than you, consider increasing your contribution slightly as a gesture of goodwill, which may encourage continued or increased contributions from others.",
        "69": "Communication: If the game allows for communication between players, use it to reinforce trust and encourage a stable contribution level from all players, which can help everyone's chances of reaching their token goals.",
        "70": "Estimate Future Gains: Based on the average contributions and the multiplier effect, estimate your potential gains from the public pot in future rounds. This will help you determine how many tokens you need to keep in your private collection versus contribute to the public pot.",
        "71": "Balance Risk and Reward: As the game progresses, the risk of not reaching your goal increases. Balance the immediate reward from the public pot against the risk of falling short of your goal.",
        "72": "Assess the Competition: Recognize that all players are likely trying to reach the same primary goal of accumulating tokens. Consider how competitive the environment is and whether you need to contribute more or less to stay ahead.",
        "73": "Stay Vigilant: Keep track of the game dynamics and be ready to change your strategy if the situation calls for it. Vigilance will allow you to respond quickly to any unexpected moves by other players.",
        "74": "Prepare for Last-Round Dynamics: Anticipate changes in player behavior in the final round. Players may contribute differently when it's their last chance to increase their token count.",
        "75": "Adapt to Changes: Be ready to adapt your strategy based on the outcomes of round 18 and 19. The final round may require a different approach depending on your token count and the behavior of other players.",
        "76": "Avoid Risky Gambles: Since the goal is to accumulate more than 30 tokens, avoid making large contributions that could jeopardize your ability to reach the target. A conservative approach may be more reliable.",
        "77": "Minimize Losses: Since you cannot reach the primary goal, focus on ending the game with as many tokens as possible. This means contributing the minimum to avoid losing out on potential gains from the public pot.",
        "78": "Avoid Overcommitting: There's no benefit to contributing more than necessary since you can't reach the primary goal. Keep your contribution low to retain as many tokens as possible.",
        "79": "Final Round Strategy: In the final round, players may change their behavior. Some might contribute nothing, hoping to free-ride on others' contributions. Others might contribute more, trying to maximize their final gain. Be cautious and assume a conservative approach.",
        "80": "Aim for a Surplus: Contribute an amount that not only breaks even but also provides a surplus. This may mean contributing slightly more than the break-even point if you can rely on others to contribute as well.",
        "81": "Endgame Contributions: In the final rounds, contribute more or less depending on your token count relative to the goal of ending with positive gains. Take a conservative approach if close to the goal, and a riskier approach if far from the goal.",
        "82": "Monitor Thresholds: Keep an eye on the token counts of other players. If you notice someone is significantly ahead or behind, it might influence the overall strategy of the group and affect your decisions.",
        "83": "Predict Future Contributions: Based on the previous rounds, try to predict the contributions of other players. If you expect them to contribute less, you might need to contribute more to ensure a decent public good payout.",
        "84": "Consider Strategic Generosity: If you are close to your goal, a higher contribution might encourage others to maintain or increase their contributions, which could benefit everyone, including you, in the long run.",
        "85": "Watch for Free-Riders: Be aware of players who might be contributing significantly less yet still benefiting from the public good. Adjust your strategy accordingly to avoid being exploited by free-riders.",
        "86": "Identify the Leader: Notice that after round 3, there is no clear leader, but player_4 has consistently had a slightly higher token count. This could indicate a pattern of conservative play or strategic contribution.",
        "87": "Assess Risk Tolerance: Given that the token counts are relatively close, players may be risk-averse and might not want to contribute too much to avoid falling behind. You can use this information to gauge how much you should contribute without risking too much.",
        "88": "Predict Future Contributions: If players continue with similar patterns, the public pot will likely receive around 20 tokens each round. You can use this estimate to plan your contributions.",
        "89": "Adjust Contributions Strategically: If you notice that the public pot is consistently low, consider contributing slightly more than the lowest contributor to ensure the public good is funded, but not so much that it jeopardizes your token conservation strategy.",
        "90": "Evaluate Each Round Independently: Treat each round as a unique decision-making scenario based on the current state of the game, rather than strictly adhering to past strategies. This allows for flexibility and adaptation to changing conditions.",
        "91": "Endgame Push: In the last few rounds, if you are still short of your goal, consider a final push by contributing more to the public pot, but only if the expected return justifies the risk.",
        "92": "Consider the Remaining Rounds: With several rounds left, you have time to experiment with your contributions. If you are ahead, you might take a risk by contributing less to increase your private holdings. If you are behind, you might need to contribute more to catch up.",
        "93": "Analyze Contribution Efficiency: Review the past rounds to determine the efficiency of your contributions. If contributing 1 token has consistently given you a return greater than 1 token, it suggests that other players are contributing enough to the public pot to make this a viable strategy.",
        "94": "Monitor Outcomes: After round 19, reassess your token count and adjust your strategy for the final round. If you are still short of your goal, you may need to contribute more to the public pot, hoping other players do the same.",
        "95": "Strategic Contribution: In round 19, consider contributing enough to ensure you are within reach of your goal in the final round, but not so much that it becomes impossible to achieve your goal if the public pot does not yield the expected return.",
        "96": "Calculate the Current Average: Determine the average number of tokens held by all players after each round. This will give you a benchmark to stay above.",
        "97": "Monitor the Competition: Keep an eye on the token counts of other players, especially those closest to you in count. You need to ensure that your actions keep you ahead of the pack.",
        "98": "Adapt to Changes: If you notice a trend in increasing or decreasing contributions from others, adjust your strategy accordingly. If contributions are decreasing, you may need to contribute less to stay above average.",
        "99": "Consider the Endgame: As the game progresses, the importance of each decision increases. Plan your contributions in the later rounds to ensure you stay above the average when it counts the most.",
        "100": "Avoid Falling Behind: It's easier to maintain a lead than to catch up. Ensure that your token count does not fall below the average, as it may be difficult to regain your position.",
        "101": "Maximize Gains When Safe: If you have a comfortable lead above the average, you might consider contributing more to the public pot to maximize your gains, but only if it does not jeopardize your lead.",
        "102": "Calculate Required Public Pot Size: Ensure that the pot size is sufficient to provide the necessary gains. Aim for a pot size of at least 3.17 tokens before doubling to meet the average gain requirement.",
        "103": "Estimate Safe Contribution: Contribute enough to help reach the required pot size without depleting private tokens. Estimate a safe contribution amount based on the group's behavior.",
        "104": "Consider Strategic Variability: Vary contributions strategically. Contribute more when others are contributing less and contribute less when others are contributing more.",
        "105": "Prepare for Uncertainty: Be prepared to adapt your strategy if the game dynamics change unexpectedly.",
        "106": "Observe and React: If other players increase their contributions, you may not need to contribute as much to achieve the average gain target. Conversely, if others contribute less, you might need to contribute more to compensate.",
        "107": "Communicate with Others: If communication is allowed, you might try to coordinate with other players to ensure a higher contribution from everyone in the final round, thus increasing the public pot significantly.",
        "108": "Evaluate Risk vs. Reward: Assess the risk of not reaching the 30-token goal against the potential reward of achieving the average gain target. It may be more prudent to focus on the primary goal if the risk is too high.",
        "109": "Calculate Minimum Contribution for Survival: You need to gain at least 0.95 tokens per round to reach your goal. Since the public pot is doubled and then divided among all players, you need to ensure that the total contributions, including yours, are enough to provide you with this minimum gain. If all players contribute equally, each player needs to put in at least 2 tokens per round to ensure everyone gets at least 2 tokens back (since 2 tokens * 10 players * 2 = 40 tokens, and 40 tokens / 10 players = 4 tokens per player).",
        "110": "Predict and React: If you can predict the behavior of other players, you can adjust your contributions accordingly. If you expect others to contribute less in a particular round, you might need to contribute more to compensate, and vice versa.",
        "111": "Collaboration and Communication: If the game rules allow, communicate with other players to establish a mutual understanding of contribution levels that will benefit all and help you reach your goal.",
        "112": "Adaptability: Be prepared to adapt your strategy based on the outcomes of each round. If you find that the average gain is decreasing, you may need to contribute more to boost the public pot, or if it's increasing, you might be able to contribute less.",
        "113": "Monitor Token Accumulation Pace: You need to ensure that your token count is on an upward trajectory. If you find that your token count is stagnating or decreasing, you may need to adjust your contributions downward.",
        "114": "Strategize for Player Behavior: If you notice any players consistently contributing more or less, you may adjust your strategy to either encourage cooperative behavior or to prevent being taken advantage of by free riders.",
        "115": "Monitor and Adjust: Keep a close eye on the contributions and gains each round. If the trend changes and the public pot provides less than expected, you'll need to adjust your contributions accordingly.",
        "116": "Adapt to Player Dropouts: If any players start contributing significantly less or stop contributing altogether, be prepared to adjust your strategy to either compensate for the reduced public pot or to protect your own token count.",
        "117": "Avoid Drastic Changes: Sudden changes in your contribution strategy might prompt other players to alter their behavior, which could negatively impact the public pot. Try to maintain a consistent strategy that aligns with the group's behavior while still working towards your goal.",
        "118": "Leverage Information: Use the information from previous rounds to inform your decisions. If certain players consistently contribute more or less, factor this into your strategy.",
        "119": "Prepare for Variability: Be ready for variability in the public pot's returns as the game progresses. The multiplier effect means that even small changes in total contributions can have a significant impact on the public good payout.",
        "120": "Influence the Public Pot: If you decide to contribute more (e.g., 5 tokens), you could potentially encourage others to maintain or increase their contributions, ensuring a healthy public pot while not falling behind.",
        "121": "Maintain a Competitive Edge: Try to keep your token count close to the top players without making yourself a target for others to undercut. This might involve contributing just enough to benefit from the public pot while retaining a sufficient number of tokens.",
        "122": "Evaluate Other Players' Strategies: Look for patterns in other players' contributions. If some players consistently contribute less, you may need to adjust your strategy to either encourage more cooperation or to protect your own token count.",
        "123": "Consistency: Aim for consistent gains each round rather than fluctuating contributions that could lead to unpredictable returns. This will help you steadily approach your goal.",
        "124": "Communication and Negotiation: If the game rules allow for communication, use it to negotiate contribution levels with other players to ensure a stable and predictable public pot.",
        "125": "Avoid Risky Moves: With only two rounds left, avoid making large contributions that could jeopardize your lead. Stick to conservative contributions that reflect the current trend of the game.",
        "126": "Secure Your Lead: If you have a lead over other players, ensure your contributions in the next two rounds secure that lead. Do not contribute so little that you risk being overtaken, but also do not contribute so much that you fall below your target of 30 tokens.",
        "127": "Monitor the Public Pot: Keep an eye on the total contributions to the public pot. If contributions are decreasing, consider whether you should adjust your contribution to maintain a stable public good payout.",

          "content": "\n\nYou are participating in a game played by 5 players over 37 rounds.\n\nGame Rules:\n\n1. In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Calculate Remaining Rounds: Determine how many rounds are left in the game. This will help you plan how many tokens you need to gain per round to reach your goal.\n - Consider the Current Token Count: You currently have 20.8 tokens. To reach your goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens, you need to gain at least 9.2 tokens in the remaining rounds. This requires a strategy that maximizes your gains while minimizing risks.\n - Fine-Grained Goals/Guidelines: {'Contribute Slightly Below Average': 'To ensure a net gain, you might consider contributing slightly less than the average contribution of the group, as long as it is at or above your break-even point of 2.2 tokens.', 'Adjust Based on Token Goal': 'If you are close to your goal of 30 tokens, you may choose to contribute exactly at your break-even point to maximize your private token retention while still benefiting from the public pot.', 'Monitor the Public Pot': 'Keep an eye on the total contributions to the public pot. If contributions drop significantly, you may need to adjust your strategy to either contribute more to maintain the public good or contribute less if you predict a trend towards free-riding by others.', 'Plan for the Remaining Rounds': 'With 8 rounds left, plan your contributions to ensure a steady increase in your token count. Avoid drastic changes that could lead to unpredictable outcomes.'}\n - Determine Optimal Contribution: Given the need for a substantial increase in tokens, you may need to contribute more to the public pot to ensure a larger public good payout. However, contributing too much could jeopardize your ability to reach the goal if others do not contribute similarly.\n - Balance Risk and Reward: If the group is contributing consistently, the risk of contributing a moderate amount is lower, as the public good will likely be maintained. However, be prepared to adjust if this pattern changes.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Evaluate Current Position: You currently have 21.8 tokens, and with only two rounds left, the maximum you can gain from the public pot is limited. You need to calculate the potential gains from different contribution levels.\n - Target Token Count: Keep in mind your goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens by the end of the game. Calculate the minimum number of tokens you need to contribute to reach this goal, considering the potential gains from the public pot.\n - Consider the Public Good Multiplier: Remember that the tokens in the public pot are doubled. To gain 0.65 tokens per round, the public pot needs to have at least 6.5 tokens (0.65 tokens * 10 players / 2 multiplier = 6.5 tokens).\n - Assess the Trend: It seems that the overall contribution to the public pot is decreasing as the game progresses. This could be due to players becoming more conservative with their tokens as they aim to reach their individual goals. You should monitor this trend closely.\n - Plan for the Long Term: You don't need to reach your goal immediately. Plan your contributions so that you gradually increase your token count while keeping an eye on the 30-token target.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

        "45": "Estimate Optimal Contribution: Given the doubling factor, you need to estimate how much to contribute to maximize your gain while not depleting your private tokens. If others are contributing low amounts, contributing slightly more could yield a higher return, but this comes with increased risk.",

        "49": "Estimate Public Good Payoff: Given that the pot is doubled, you can estimate the average gain per player by doubling the average contribution and dividing by the number of players. If the average gain is higher than the average contribution, you can potentially contribute less.",
        "50": "Determine Safe Contribution Margin: To ensure a gain, you want to contribute slightly more than the minimum you expect others to contribute. If players are contributing an average of 1.5 tokens, contributing 2 tokens might be a safe bet to ensure a gain.",

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Predictive Modeling: Expect that contributions may continue to decrease as players become more conservative with their tokens. Plan your contributions accordingly to maximize your benefit from the public pot without overextending yourself.\n - Stay Focused on the Primary Goal: Always keep your primary goal in mind. Your contributions should be guided by the overarching objective of accumulating more than 30 tokens by the end of the game.\n - Maintain or Slightly Increase Contribution: Your average gain so far seems to be slightly above your average contribution, which suggests that your current strategy is working in your favor. However, you need to be cautious not to increase your contribution too much, as this could deplete your private tokens. A slight increase might be beneficial if it leads to a higher public pot without significantly risking your token reserve.\n - Adapt to the Game's Progression: As the game progresses, players may become more conservative or more aggressive with their contributions. Be prepared to adapt your strategy accordingly.\n - Optimize Final Contributions: If players continue with similar contributions, contributing 2 tokens might be a safe bet. This would likely result in a public pot of around 7 to 10 tokens, which doubles to 14 to 20 tokens, and then divided by 5 players gives each player 2.8 to 4 tokens. You need to ensure that your contribution, plus the expected gain, keeps you on track for the 30-token goal.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

This would likely result in a public pot of around 7 to 10 tokens, which doubles to 14 to 20 tokens, and then divided by 5 players gives each player 2.8 to 4 tokens.

        "57": "Reflect on Game Dynamics: Consider the dynamics of the previous rounds. If players have been relatively consistent in their contributions, it's likely that the final round will follow a similar pattern. If there have been significant fluctuations, expect the unexpected and plan accordingly.",

        "205": "Consider the Group Dynamics: If players are contributing fairly evenly, it might be advantageous to continue with a similar contribution to maintain the status quo. However, if you detect a shift in others' contributions, be prepared to adjust yours.",
        "206": "Calculate Required Gains: You need to gain 8.2 tokens over the next two rounds, which means an average gain of 4.1 tokens per round. This is a challenging target given the past gains, so you'll need to adjust your strategy accordingly.",
        "207": "Prepare for the Final Round: In the penultimate round (round 23), aim to contribute an amount that will set you up for a final push in the last round (round 24). You don't need to reach your goal in round 23, but you should be close enough to make it achievable in round 24.",
        "208": "Calculate Break-Even Point: You need to gain at least 1 token per round to meet your goal. Aim for a public pot that provides at least a 2-token gain for you after doubling, considering there are 10 players.",
        "209": "Assess Contribution Patterns: Look at the historical contribution patterns of the players. Ensure that you contribute enough to at least match the average contribution to not fall behind.",
        "210": "Plan for the Final Rounds: In the last few rounds, carefully plan your contributions to ensure you cross the 30-token threshold.",
        "211": "Keep Track of Your Tokens: Always know how many tokens you have and how many you need to reach your goal. Make informed decisions about your contributions in each round.",
        "212": "Avoid Over-Contribution: Contributing too much could deplete your private tokens without guaranteeing a proportionally higher return, especially if others contribute less. Aim to contribute just enough to leverage the multiplier effect without risking too many of your tokens.",
        "213": "Stay Consistent or Adapt: If your current strategy is working and you are steadily approaching your goal, consistency might be key. However, if you find yourself falling behind, be prepared to adapt and contribute more.",
        "214": "Prepare for Variability: Be ready to adapt your strategy in subsequent rounds based on the evolving dynamics of the game. The contributions of others may change, and you'll need to respond accordingly.",
        "215": "Calculate Minimum Contribution: Determine the minimum number of tokens you can contribute while still benefiting from the public pot. This ensures you do not deplete your tokens too quickly and can continue to participate effectively in future rounds.",
        "216": "Predict Future Gains: Estimate the potential gains from the public pot based on past contributions and use this to inform how many tokens you can afford to contribute while still growing your reserve.",
        "217": "Adjust for Player Behavior: If you notice a trend in the other players' contributions (e.g., they are contributing less), you may need to adjust your contribution to either capitalize on their lower input or to encourage a higher collective contribution.",
        "218": "Consider Contribution Fluctuations: Be prepared to fluctuate your contributions based on the round and the behavior of other players. If you're ahead, you might contribute less to preserve your lead. If you're behind, you might contribute more to catch up.",
        "219": "Communicate and Collaborate: If there is an opportunity to communicate with other players, discuss strategies that could benefit the group while also ensuring your individual safety buffer.",
        "220": "Strategic Transparency: Consider whether revealing some information about your strategy to other players could influence their contributions in a way that benefits you. This could be a double-edged sword, so use this tactic carefully.",
        "221": "Identify Outliers: Pay attention to any players who consistently contribute significantly more or less than the average. If a player consistently contributes less, you may need to adjust your strategy to avoid being taken advantage of. If a player consistently contributes more, you might be able to contribute slightly less while still benefiting from the public good.",
        "222": "Adjust Contributions Strategically: If the overall contributions decrease, consider increasing your contribution slightly to ensure the public good remains substantial. However, if contributions increase and you are comfortably on track to meet your primary objective, you might contribute slightly less to conserve tokens.",
        "223": "Monitor Token Trends: Pay attention to whether the trend in contributions is increasing or decreasing. If players are contributing less as the game progresses, adjust your contributions accordingly to maintain a conservative stance.",
        "224": "Maintain a Middle Ground: Since you're in the middle of the pack, aim to maintain a balance between contributing to the public pot and retaining tokens. You don't want to be the lowest contributor, but you also don't want to contribute so much that you end up with fewer private tokens than others.",
        "225": "Strategize for Remaining Rounds: With half of the game remaining, plan your strategy for the next 10 rounds. Consider contributing an amount that will keep you in the middle or slightly above the average if you can afford it, to slowly build up your public good payoff while not depleting your private tokens.",
        "226": "Consider the Endgame: As the game progresses, players may become more conservative with their contributions. Anticipate this and plan your contributions in a way that allows you to capitalize on the final rounds, where you might be able to contribute less and still receive a reasonable share of the public good.",
        "227": "Adjust to Token Fluctuations: If the public pot's returns start to diminish because overall contributions are decreasing, you may need to adjust your contributions downward to conserve tokens while still receiving a share of the public good.",

        "229": "Monitor the Threshold for Diminishing Returns: There's a point where contributing more tokens to the public pot yields diminishing returns for you. Calculate this threshold and ensure your contributions stay below it to maximize your private token retention.",
        "230": "Leverage Information Asymmetry: Since contributions are secret, you can use this to your advantage. If you've been contributing consistently, other players might expect you to continue doing so. You can strategically contribute less, hoping others will maintain or increase their contributions based on the pattern they've observed.",
        "231": "Communicate and Influence: If there is a way to communicate with other players, use it to encourage fair contributions or to propose a strategy that benefits all players, including yourself.",
        "232": "Monitor Your Token Count: Keep a close eye on your token count after each round. If you find that your strategy is not allowing you to accumulate tokens at the desired rate, be prepared to adjust your contributions accordingly.",
        "233": "Establish Alliances: Form alliances with other players to agree on a mutual contribution strategy. This could help ensure a more predictable and stable return from the public pot each round.",
        "234": "Assess Current Position: You currently have 20.4 tokens after contributing 5 tokens in the first round. You are in the middle of the pack in terms of token count. This is a relatively stable position, but you need to accumulate more than 30 tokens by the end of the game.",
        "235": "Analyze the Trend: Look at the contribution patterns of the other players and yourself. It seems that the contributions are consistently low, which suggests a cautious approach by all players. This could be due to a lack of trust or a strategy to maximize private gains.",
        "236": "Assess the Competition: You are currently in the middle of the pack in terms of token count. To move ahead, you may need to slightly increase your contribution when others are contributing less, to gain a larger share of the public good payoff.",
        "237": "Leverage the Public Good: If you can predict the contributions of others accurately, you might be able to leverage the public good by contributing just enough to maximize your return without overcommitting.",
        "238": "Calculate Optimal Contribution: Given that the public pot is doubled, you want to contribute enough to benefit from the public good but not so much that you fall behind in private token accumulation. You might consider contributing slightly less than the average of the previous round if you expect others to contribute at similar levels.",
        "239": "Plan for Variability: Be ready to increase your contribution if you notice a trend of decreasing contributions from others, which could lead to a lower public pot. Conversely, if contributions increase and the public pot grows, you might be able to contribute less and still receive a substantial return.",
        "240": "Analyze Past Contributions: Look at the past contributions of all players, including yourself. Notice that contributions have been moderate, with no player contributing excessively or too little. This suggests a level of cooperation among players.",
        "241": "Assess Your Position: You currently have 24 tokens, which is around the average among players. You are neither at the bottom nor at the top, which gives you some flexibility in your strategy.",
        "242": "Monitor the Public Pot: Keep an eye on the total tokens in the public pot. If the pot starts to decrease significantly, it may be a sign that other players are contributing less, and you may need to adjust your contributions accordingly.",
        "243": "Calculate Potential Gains: Before deciding on your contribution, calculate the potential gains from the public pot. If contributing 3 tokens still provides a reasonable gain due to the multiplier effect, it might be a good strategy to conserve your tokens.",
        "244": "Observe Changes in Strategy: Be alert to any changes in other players' strategies. If you notice a shift in contribution patterns, be prepared to adjust your range accordingly.",
        "245": "Prepare for Variability: The game's dynamics can change, so be ready to contribute anywhere within your 3-5 token range based on the most recent trends and your current token count.",
        "246": "Anticipate Endgame Behavior: Players may change their strategies as the game progresses, especially in the final rounds. Be prepared to adapt your contributions in response to these changes to ensure you meet your primary objective.",
        "247": "Balance Risk and Reward: If you find yourself falling behind, you may need to take calculated risks by contributing more to the public pot, hoping for a larger return. However, be cautious not to overextend and deplete your private tokens.",
        "248": "Maintain a Competitive Edge: Aim to keep your token count close to the top players without making your strategy too predictable. This might involve occasionally matching the highest contributions to signal cooperation or contributing less to conserve tokens.",
        "249": "Contribute Strategically: Since the total tokens in the public pot were 26 and the public good payoff was 5.4 for you, the net gain was 0.4 tokens when you contributed 5. Consider contributing slightly less if you expect others to contribute the same or more, as this could increase your private token retention without significantly affecting your share of the public good.",
        "250": "Avoid Extremes: Do not be the highest or lowest contributor unless you have a strategic reason to do so. Staying in the middle can be a safer position and may prevent you from being targeted or noticed by other players.",
        "251": "Consider Game Progression: As the game progresses, the risk of contributing may change. Be prepared to contribute more or less depending on how close you are to your goal and how many rounds are left.",
        "252": "Adapt to Changes: Be ready to adapt your strategy if the game takes an unexpected turn, such as a sudden change in the contribution patterns of other players or if you find yourself falling behind in your token count.",
        "253": "Maximize Private Token Retention: While contributing to the public pot is necessary, keeping a portion of your tokens private ensures you have a buffer and can continue to play strategically in later rounds.",
        "254": "Plan for the Long Term: Develop a strategy that considers all 20 rounds. This might mean contributing more early on when the risk is lower and being more conservative in later rounds as you approach your goal.",
        "255": "Balance Risk and Reward: Since you gained slightly by contributing 5 tokens, you might decide to contribute the same amount if you expect similar behavior from others. However, if you want to take a conservative approach to preserve your tokens, you might contribute slightly less, assuming others will still contribute enough to create a substantial public good.",
        "256": "Consider Long-Term Sustainability: Ensure that your strategy is sustainable over the remaining rounds. Don't overcommit in the early rounds to the point where you have too few tokens to contribute later on.",
        "257": "Adapt to Game Dynamics: Be ready to adapt your strategy if the game dynamics change, such as if players start contributing significantly more or less to the public pot.",
        "258": "Plan for Uncertainty: Keep in mind that other players may also change their strategies, so have a plan for different scenarios, such as if the public pot's returns diminish or if players start free-riding more.",
        "259": "Strategize for Potential Additional Rounds: If the game continues beyond the expected 20 rounds, consider that other players may also change their strategies. Be prepared to adapt and possibly take calculated risks to increase your gains.",
        "260": "Avoid Falling Behind: Ensure that your strategy does not cause you to fall behind in token accumulation compared to other players. Falling too far behind could make it impossible to reach your goal.",
        "261": "Stay Alert to Game Dynamics: The game dynamics can change rapidly, especially in the final stages. Stay alert to any shifts in player behavior or rules that could impact your strategy.",
        "262": "Psychological Warfare: Use psychological tactics to influence the contributions of others. This could involve signaling a willingness to cooperate or bluffing about your intentions to contribute, thereby affecting the strategies of other players.",
        "263": "Endgame Strategy: As the game nears its end, calculate the minimum contributions needed to surpass the 30-token threshold, taking into account the potential contributions from others and the public good payoff."

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Calculate Outcomes: Determine the range of possible outcomes based on different contribution levels from yourself and others. How will these affect your token count?\n - Predict Others' Behavior: Given the history, players seem to contribute between 1 to 3 tokens. It's reasonable to assume that a similar pattern will continue. You should aim to contribute in a way that maximizes your gain while not falling behind in private token retention.\n - Final Round Focus: In the last round, prioritize retaining tokens over contributing to the public pot, as this is your last opportunity to increase your personal token count towards the goal of 30 tokens.\n - Contribution Calibration: You should calibrate your contributions to ensure that you can achieve the goal of gaining at least 8.2 tokens in the remaining rounds while still contributing enough to the public pot to maintain cooperation.\n - Observation and Adaptation: Observe the contributions in the next round closely. Adjust your final round strategy based on the public pot size and the contributions of others.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

Did you contribute consistently, or did you adjust based on the behavior of others? Did you contribute more or less when the public pot was low?",
        "82": "Reflect on Risk and Reward: Analyze the risk you took in each round by contributing more or less. Did the risk pay off in terms of the public good payout? Could a different level of risk have resulted in a better outcome?",
        "83": "Learn from Others: Observe which players ended with the most tokens and consider what strategies they may have used. Did they contribute more consistently, or did they adjust their contributions based on the game's dynamics?",
        "84": "Adaptability: Given that the game is over, think about how you could have adapted your strategy in response to the changing contributions of other players. Were there opportunities to contribute less when others were contributing more, or vice versa?",

        "241": "Analyze Contribution Patterns: Look at the history of contributions from each player. It appears that contributions are generally decreasing over time. This could indicate a trend towards more conservative play as players may be trying to retain more tokens for themselves.",
        "242": "Predict Future Contributions: Given the trend, it's reasonable to expect that contributions may continue to decrease or stabilize at a low level. You should prepare for the possibility that the public good will not be as large in future rounds.",
        "243": "Consider Strategic Generosity: If you contribute slightly more than what you predict others will contribute, you might be able to encourage a culture of higher contributions again, which could benefit you in the long run if others follow suit.",
        "244": "Monitor Others' Responses: After adjusting your contribution, carefully observe the contributions of others in the next round. If they match or exceed your contribution, it may be a sign that you can continue with a similar strategy. If they contribute less, you may need to reassess again.",
        "245": "Evaluate Round-by-Round Changes: Notice how the contributions change from round to round. Are players contributing less over time, indicating a trend towards free-riding, or are contributions stable? This can inform whether you should contribute more or less in the upcoming rounds.",
        "246": "Assess Your Position Relative to Others: You are currently in the middle of the pack in terms of token accumulation. Consider whether you need to take a more aggressive or conservative approach to move up in the rankings.",
        "247": "Monitor the Public Good Multiplier Effect: The public good's value is doubled, so contributing can be beneficial if others are also contributing. However, if the trend is towards lower contributions, the value of contributing decreases, and you may want to retain more tokens.",
        "248": "React to the Game Dynamics: If you see a sudden change in contributions (e.g., a player starts contributing significantly more or less), be ready to adapt your strategy immediately. This could be a sign of a shift in the game's dynamics.",
        "249": "Calculate Risk-Reward Scenarios: Before each round, consider the best- and worst-case scenarios based on your contribution and the potential contributions of others. Decide how much risk you are willing to take to maximize your reward.",
        "250": "Balance Risk and Reward: Be mindful of the balance between contributing to the public good and retaining tokens. Since the multiplier is 2, you need to consider whether the potential gain from the public pot justifies the risk of contributing your tokens.",
        "251": "Plan for Future Rounds: Remember that this is a multi-round game. Your strategy in this round should not only be about immediate gain but also about positioning yourself advantageously for future rounds.",
        "252": "Communicate and Influence: If communication with other players is allowed, use it to influence their contributions. Encourage a culture of fair contributions or propose a strategy that benefits all cooperative players.",
        "253": "Be Ready to Pivot: After seeing the results of this round, be prepared to change your strategy for the next round. Flexibility is key, and you should not be locked into a single approach if the game dynamics shift.",
        "254": "Risk Assessment: Evaluate the risk and potential reward of each contribution decision. Since the game is repeated, you can afford to take calculated risks in early rounds to learn about the behavior of other players and adjust your strategy accordingly.",
        "255": "Calculate Optimal Contribution: Determine the number of tokens you should contribute to maximize your gain while moving towards your goal. Since the public pot is doubled, you need to contribute enough to benefit from the public good but not so much that it hinders your progress towards 30 tokens.",
        "256": "Monitor Changes in Player Behavior: Be alert to any changes in the contribution levels of other players. If players start contributing less, you may need to adjust your strategy to either contribute more to maintain the public good or contribute less to protect your private token stash.",
        "257": "Contribution Adjustments: If you notice a trend in increasing or decreasing contributions from others, adjust your contribution accordingly. If others are contributing less, you might want to contribute slightly more to maintain a stable public pot, and vice versa.",
        "258": "Token Reserve Goal: Set a sub-goal for the minimum number of tokens you want to have by certain rounds (e.g., at least 20 tokens by round 10). This will help you ensure that you have enough tokens to contribute in later rounds while still working towards the primary goal of accumulating more than 30 tokens.",
        "259": "Monitor Player Behavior: Keep a close eye on the contribution patterns of other players. If you notice consistent behavior from certain players, you can adjust your strategy to complement theirs.",
        "260": "Avoid Free Riding: While being conservative, ensure that your contributions do not drop so low as to be perceived as free-riding, which could lead to a decrease in overall contributions and harm your chances of reaching your goal.",
        "261": "Adapt to Changes: Be prepared to change your strategy if the dynamics of the game shift significantly due to other players' actions or if you find yourself falling behind in your token accumulation goal.",
        "262": "Set Round-Specific Goals: Establish a target number of tokens you aim to have after each round. This will help you make decisions about how many tokens to contribute and allow you to adjust your strategy as needed.",
        "263": "Consider the Multiplication Factor: Remember that the public pot is doubled. If you can predict the total contributions of other players, you can contribute the minimum amount required to still gain from the public good without sacrificing too many of your tokens.",
        "264": "Balance Risk and Reward: Since you are already ahead of some players in terms of token count, you can afford to take a slightly more conservative approach in your contributions, reducing risk while still aiming for a steady gain.",
        "265": "Maintain a Competitive Edge: Ensure that your token count remains competitive with other players. If you fall behind, you may need to contribute more aggressively to catch up. If you are ahead, you can afford to be more conservative.",
        "266": "Strategic Conservatism or Generosity: Depending on the behavior of other players, you might adopt a conservative strategy to retain more tokens or a more generous strategy to encourage a culture of high contributions to the public pot.",
        "267": "Alliance Formation: If communication is allowed, form alliances with other players to agree on contribution levels, ensuring a stable and predictable increase in the public good, which can benefit all cooperative players.",
        "268": "Contribution Strategy: Aim to contribute slightly less than the average contribution if you expect the cooperative behavior to continue. This could increase your net gain while still benefiting from the public good.",
        "269": "Calculate Break-Even Point: Determine the minimum contribution you can make while still receiving enough from the public pot to move towards your goal. For example, if everyone else continues to contribute similarly to Round 1, you could potentially contribute less and still receive a beneficial share.",
        "270": "Risk Management: Be prepared to take calculated risks if necessary. If you find yourself falling short of your goal in the later rounds, you may need to contribute less to retain more tokens, hoping that others will maintain the public good.",
        "271": "Observation and Learning: Use the early rounds to gather information about the contribution patterns of other players, which can inform your strategy in later rounds.",
        "272": "Fair Play Perception: Contribute a fair amount to the public pot to avoid being seen as a free rider, which could lead to retaliation or reduced contributions from others, ultimately harming your chances of achieving your primary goal."
