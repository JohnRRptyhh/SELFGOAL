          "content": "\n\nYou are participating in a game played by 5 players over 20 rounds.\n\nGame Rules:\n\n1. In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nLearnings:\n-1. Observing the contributions of other players MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust your own contribution strategy.\n2. Contributing fewer tokens than the average MAY BE NECESSARY to maximize your private collection while still benefiting from the public good.\n3. Contributing more tokens than the average DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to maximizing your private collection.\n4. Maintaining a balance between contributing to the public pot and retaining tokens SHOULD BE NECESSARY to ensure a fair gain from the public good without being exploited.\n5. Adapting your strategy based on the behavior of other players in previous rounds MAY BE CONTRIBUTE to better outcomes in future rounds.\n6. Collaborating with other players to establish a fair contribution norm MAY BE NECESSARY to sustain the public good over multiple rounds.\n7. Keeping track of your gains and the public pot size MAY BE NECESSARY to inform your future contributions.\n8. Contributing all your tokens DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to a sustainable long-term strategy.\n9. Contributing nothing to the public pot MAY BE CONTRIBUTE to being perceived as a free rider, which could influence the contributions of others negatively.\n10. Analyzing the payoff from the public good relative to private retention SHOULD BE NECESSARY to optimize your overall benefit.\nLearnings:\n-1. Monitoring the contribution patterns of other players MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust your strategy effectively.\n2. Contributing slightly less than the average MAY BE CONTRIBUTE to maximizing your private collection while still benefiting from the public good.\n3. Contributing significantly more than the average DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to maximizing your private collection.\n4. Striking a balance between contributing to the public pot and retaining tokens SHOULD BE NECESSARY to ensure equitable gains and sustainable cooperation.\n5. Adapting your contribution strategy based on historical data and player behavior MAY BE CONTRIBUTE to improved outcomes in subsequent rounds.\n6. Establishing a collaborative norm with other players regarding contributions MAY BE NECESSARY to maintain the public good and prevent the collapse of cooperation.\n7. Keeping a detailed record of gains and the size of the public pot MAY BE NECESSARY to make informed decisions about future contributions.\n8. Contributing all your tokens in a single round DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to a sustainable strategy across multiple rounds.\n9. Contributing nothing to the public pot MAY BE CONTRIBUTE to negative perceptions among players, potentially leading to a decrease in overall contributions.\n10. Evaluating the ratio of public good payoff to private retention after each round SHOULD BE NECESSARY to optimize your benefits over the course of the game.\nLearnings:\n-1. Monitoring the average contribution level of all players MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust your strategy to avoid being the highest or lowest contributor.\n2. Contributing slightly less than the average observed in previous rounds MAY BE CONTRIBUTE to maximizing your private collection while still benefiting from the public good.\n3. Analyzing the trends in contributions and adjusting your strategy accordingly MAY BE CONTRIBUTE to better outcomes in future rounds.\n4. Establishing a pattern of consistent, fair contributions MAY BE NECESSARY to maintain trust and cooperation among players.\n5. Keeping your contributions flexible and responsive to the game dynamics MAY BE CONTRIBUTE to a sustainable long-term strategy.\n6. Contributing nothing to the public pot DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to the collective well-being and may lead to negative consequences for the group dynamic.\n7. Contributing all your tokens in a single round DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to a sustainable strategy and may leave you vulnerable in subsequent rounds.\n8. Striking a balance between contributing to the public pot and retaining tokens SHOULD BE NECESSARY to ensure equitable gains and prevent exploitation.\n9. Collaborating with other players to establish a fair contribution norm MAY BE NECESSARY to sustain the public good and ensure mutual benefit.\n10. Evaluating the ratio of public good payoff to private retention after each round SHOULD BE NECESSARY to optimize your benefits and adapt your future contributions.\nLearnings:\n-1. Monitoring the average contribution of all players MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust your strategy to avoid being the highest or lowest contributor.\n2.

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nLearnings:\n-1. Observing the contributions of other players MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust your own contribution strategy.\n2. Contributing a moderate amount SHOULD BE NECESSARY to balance between personal gain and contributing to the public good.\n3. Keeping some tokens back MAY CONTRIBUTE to ensuring you have resources in later rounds.\n4. Contributing the same amount as the majority DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to gaining a competitive advantage.\n5. Increasing contributions when others are contributing less MAY BE NECESSARY to maintain the public good payoff.\n6. Decreasing contributions if others are contributing more MAY BE NECESSARY to prevent over-investment in the public pot.\n7. Analyzing the gains of each player after each round MAY CONTRIBUTE to predicting their future contributions.\n8. Adapting your strategy based on the game's progress SHOULD BE NECESSARY to maximize your overall benefit.\n9. Collaborating with other players MAY CONTRIBUTE to a more predictable and stable public pot.\n10. Contributing too little to the public pot DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to the collective welfare, which could lead to lower overall payoffs.\nLearnings:\n-1. Monitoring the contribution patterns of other players MAY BE NECESSARY to adapt your strategy effectively.\n2. Contributing a consistent amount MAY CONTRIBUTE to establishing trust among players.\n3. Adjusting your contributions based on the average contributions of others MAY BE NECESSARY to optimize your personal gain while supporting the public good.\n4. Saving a portion of your tokens for future rounds MAY BE NECESSARY to ensure you have resources for strategic plays later in the game.\n5. Communicating with other players, if possible, MAY CONTRIBUTE to a more coordinated approach to contributions.\n6. Analyzing the return on investment from the public pot SHOULD BE NECESSARY to inform your future contribution levels.\n7. Balancing between personal savings and public contributions MAY BE NECESSARY to maintain a competitive position.\n8. Contributing slightly more than the average when others contribute less MAY BE NECESSARY to sustain the public good without sacrificing too much personal gain.\n9. Reducing your contribution when the public pot is sufficiently funded by others MAY BE NECESSARY to conserve your tokens.\n10. Observing changes in other players' strategies MAY CONTRIBUTE to anticipating shifts in the game dynamics.\n11. Adapting your strategy in response to the collective behavior of the group SHOULD BE NECESSARY to maintain or improve your standing.\n12. Contributing too much relative to others DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to maximizing your individual payoff.\n13. Being too conservative with contributions MAY CONTRIBUTE to a lower public good, potentially reducing overall gains.\n14. Strategically increasing contributions in later rounds MAY BE NECESSARY to influence the final outcomes in your favor.\n15. Considering the long-term implications of your contribution strategy MAY BE NECESSARY for sustained success throughout the game.\nLearnings:\n-1. Observing the average contribution level MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust your strategy in a way that balances personal gain with the public good.\n2. Contributing slightly above the average MAY BE NECESSARY to ensure a competitive edge while still fostering the public pot.\n3. Keeping a reserve of tokens MAY BE NECESSARY to have flexibility in your strategy for future rounds.\n4. Analyzing the trends in gains and contributions of other players MAY CONTRIBUTE to predicting their future behavior and adjusting your strategy accordingly.\n5.

Communicating with other players, if rules permit, MAY CONTRIBUTE to a more coordinated and effective contribution strategy.\n7. Being adaptable in your strategy MAY BE NECESSARY to respond effectively to the changing dynamics of the game.\n8. Contributing too little consistently DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to the sustainability of the public good and may lead to lower overall payoffs.\n9. Over-contributing in the early rounds MAY CONTRIBUTE to a depletion of your resources, affecting your ability to contribute in later rounds.\n10. Balancing between contributing to the public pot and retaining tokens SHOULD BE NECESSARY to maintain a strong position throughout the game.\n11. Incrementally adjusting contributions based on the game's progress MAY BE NECESSARY to stay aligned with the group's collective behavior.\n12. Saving tokens for strategic contributions in later rounds MAY BE NECESSARY to influence the game's outcome in your favor.\n13. Contributing an amount proportional to the benefits received from the public pot MAY BE NECESSARY to maintain fairness and trust among players.\n14.

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nLearnings:\n-1. Observing the contributions of other players MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust your own strategy.\n2.

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nLearnings:\n-1. Observing the contributions of other players MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust your own contribution strategy.\n2. Contributing a moderate amount of tokens MAY BE CONTRIBUTE to maintaining a balance between personal and collective gain.\n3. Contributing too few tokens DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to the collective pot, which may lead to lower public good payoffs.\n4. Contributing all your tokens SHOULD NOT BE NECESSARY as it may deplete your private collection and reduce your flexibility in future rounds.\n5. Analyzing the gains of other players MAY BE NECESSARY to understand the overall dynamics of the game.\n6. Keeping some tokens in reserve MAY BE CONTRIBUTE to having a safety net for future rounds.\n7. Matching the average contribution of other players MAY BE CONTRIBUTE to ensuring a fair share of the public good without being exploited.\n8. Adjusting contributions based on the behavior of others in previous rounds MAY BE NECESSARY to optimize your strategy.\n9. Consistently contributing less than the average DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to a reputation of cooperation, which may affect how other players interact with you.\n10.

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3.
