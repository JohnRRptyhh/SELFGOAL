          "content": "\n\nYou are participating in a game played by 5 players over 35 rounds.\n\nGame Rules:\n\n1. In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Round-by-Round Analysis: Investigate if high-contributors tend to contribute more in specific rounds. Look for patterns or correlations between rounds with high token contributions and the game's multiplier. Identify if they contribute more when the public pot is expected to grow significantly, or if they hold back in rounds with lower multipliers. Examine if they have a consistent strategy, contributing in every round, or if they strategically skip rounds.\n - Token-to-Token Ratio: Calculate the ratio of tokens contributed to the total tokens they have after each round. This will help determine if they are investing a significant portion of their tokens or saving them for future rounds. Compare this ratio to other players to see if they have a higher risk tolerance or if they are more conservative with their resources.\n - Risk Management: Assess if high-contributors are more likely to contribute in rounds with a higher chance of a large public good, even if it means risking a portion of their tokens. Look for instances where they might have contributed less in rounds where the public pot was smaller, indicating they are managing their risks effectively.\n - Resource Allocation: Determine if they distribute their tokens evenly across all rounds or if they focus on specific rounds with higher multipliers. If they consistently contribute more in certain rounds, it could suggest they are optimizing their resource allocation for maximum return.\n - Player Interaction: Observe if high-contributors form alliances or engage in strategic interactions with other players. This could be an indication of their communication and negotiation skills. If they are known to contribute more to specific players, it might suggest they are building trust or leveraging relationships to secure a larger share.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Maintain a 10-15 Token Range: {'Aim for 10 tokens in 60% of the rounds': 'To avoid standing out.', 'Contribute 15 tokens in 40% of the rounds': 'To ensure a reasonable return on your investment.', 'Guideline': 'Be mindful of the multiplier and the size of the public pot when deciding between the two amounts.'}\n - Vary Contributions within the Range: {'Spread your contributions evenly between the two amounts': 'To avoid being predictable.', 'If a round has a high multiplier, consider contributing 15 tokens': 'To maximize your gain.', 'Guideline': \"Observe the other players' contributions and adjust your strategy accordingly.\"}\n - Risk Management: {'Goal': 'Minimize risks by avoiding over-contributing in low-multiplication rounds.', 'Guidelines': ['Only contribute when the potential gain outweighs the risk of losing tokens.', 'Keep a reserve of tokens for unexpected situations or when the multiplier is low.']}\n - Influencing Contributions: Encourage players to contribute 15 tokens in high-potential rounds. Share your strategy of contributing 10 tokens in low-potential rounds to demonstrate the value of contributing more in specific situations. Offer to match their contributions in high-potential rounds if they agree.\n - Negotiation: Negotiate with other players to split the high-potential rounds' contributions. If you see a round with a high multiplier and a large public pot, propose a joint contribution of 15 tokens. Be prepared to compromise on your own contribution if necessary.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Risk Management: Be mindful of the risk involved in contributing too many tokens. If you have a limited reserve, consider contributing less in rounds where the public pot is expected to be small.\n - Round 2: If you contributed 10 in Round 1, aim for 12-15 tokens. This allows you to maintain your contribution level while potentially increasing your gain.\n - Be flexible: Be prepared to adjust your contribution based on the game's dynamics. If others are contributing more, consider contributing less to maintain your current average.\n - Maintain a Psychological Edge: Don't let your emotions dictate your actions. If you feel like you're overcontributing due to fear of missing out, remind yourself that a well-managed risk can lead to better long-term outcomes.\n - Alternating Contributions: Instead of always contributing 10 or 15, try contributing different amounts, like 8, 12, or even 18, to see if it affects the dynamics of the game. This can help you understand if there's a specific contribution level that leads to a better outcome.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.\n2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor 2 to create the \"public good\" payoff.\n3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.\n4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Learning and Adaptation: {'Reflect on Performance': 'Evaluate your performance after each round and adjust your strategy based on the results.', 'Continuous Improvement': 'Keep refining your approach as you learn from your experiences.'}\n - Resource Management: {'Reserve': 'Maintain a reserve of tokens for times when the multiplier is low or when you need to contribute more in a high multiplier round.', 'Timing': 'Strategically contribute in rounds where you have a good balance between contributing enough and preserving your tokens.'}\n - Gain vs. Contribution Ratio: Compare your gain (public good multiplied by your contribution) to the tokens you contributed in each round. If your gain is consistently higher than your contribution, you might be contributing more than necessary. If it's lower, you might need to adjust. Look for a sweet spot where your contributions lead to a reasonable return.\n - Round-by-Round Strategy: Examine the rounds where you contributed 10 and 15 to see if there were any patterns or trends. If you consistently contributed 10 in rounds with low multipliers, you might want to adjust to contribute more in those rounds. Conversely, if you contributed 15 in rounds with high multipliers, consider if you could have contributed less and saved for future rounds.\n - Risk Management: {'Goal': 'Evaluate players who take risks with their tokens.', 'Guidelines': ['Identify players who contribute a lot in a round with a low multiplier or contribute nothing in a high multiplier round.', 'Assess if these decisions are strategic or if they might be a sign of overconfidence or underestimation.']}\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

        "195": "Social Interaction: {'Engage with others': 'Initiate conversations with other players to gauge their strategies or ask for advice. Be respectful and non-confrontational.', 'Be discreet': \"While gathering information, ensure you don't reveal your own strategy or intentions.\"}",
        "196": "Data Collection: {'Keep a record': 'Keep track of the contributions, multipliers, and pot sizes for each round. This will help you analyze the data later.', 'Update your strategy': 'Regularly review your observations and update your contribution plan based on the insights you gather.'}",
        "197": "Adaptability: {'Be flexible': 'Be prepared to adjust your strategy if you notice that your initial assumptions are incorrect or if the game dynamics change.', 'Learn from mistakes': 'If you contribute too much or too little in a round, reflect on the outcome and adjust your approach for future rounds.'}",
        "198": "Pot Size Prediction: Predict the size of the public pot. If the pot is expected to be small, it might not be worth contributing much, as the final payoff will be divided evenly. Wait for a larger pot to ensure a more substantial return.",
        "199": "Diversify Contributions: Spread your contributions across multiple rounds, rather than focusing on a single round with a high multiplier. This can help you avoid overexposure to risk.",
        "200": "Learn from Past Performance: Analyze your past performance to identify when you've made successful or risky decisions. Use this information to inform your future choices.",
        "201": "Be Flexible: Be prepared to adapt your strategy if the game dynamics change. If the multiplier consistently drops or the pot size remains small, consider adjusting your risk tolerance.",
        "202": "Set Thresholds: Establish a threshold for your minimum contribution, such as contributing only when the pot is expected to grow significantly or when the multiplier is above a certain level.",
        "203": "Informative Communication: If you think a particular round is risky, communicate your reasoning to other players. This can help create a more informed environment and potentially influence their decisions.",
        "204": "Keep Track of Risks and Rewards: Maintain a record of your decisions and the outcomes to help you make better-informed choices in the future.",
        "205": "Risk vs. Reward: Evaluate the risk associated with contributing a certain number of tokens. If the risk is low and the potential reward high, consider contributing more. Conversely, if the risk is high and the potential reward is minimal, hold back.",
        "206": "Limited Resources: Keep your private tokens in check. If you have fewer tokens than your goal, focus on contributing in rounds where you can make the most impact with your remaining resources.",
        "207": "Collaboration: If possible, form alliances with other players who share your goal or have complementary strategies. This can help you pool resources and increase your chances of success.",
        "208": "Adaptive Approach: Be prepared to adjust your strategy as the game evolves. If a particular strategy proves successful, stick with it. If not, be open to changing tactics.",
        "209": "Timing and Timing Strategy: Strategically time contributions, perhaps by holding back in early rounds to build a reserve and gradually increasing contributions as the game progresses.",

        "211": "Adaptability: Be flexible and adjust strategy based on changing circumstances, such as changes in the multiplier or the behavior of other players, to increase chances of achieving the goal."
