The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.",

This information can help you make a more informed decision about your own selection.\n - Focus on numbers within the estimated range: Choose a number that is within the range of possible averages.\n - Consider the distribution of chosen numbers: If other players have chosen numbers towards the lower or higher end of the range, adjust your selection accordingly.\n - Estimate the average of all chosen numbers: Observe the numbers chosen by other players. Consider the range of possible numbers (0-100). Make an educated guess based on the observed data.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

This could indicate that players are avoiding certain numbers or that there is a misunderstanding about the target number.\n - Look for any correlations between the numbers chosen by different players: Analyze the numbers chosen by different players in previous rounds. Identify any patterns or relationships between the numbers. Consider factors such as player strategies, communication, or external influences.\n - Observe the distribution of chosen numbers: Note the range of numbers chosen by other players.

        "5": "Determine the spread of the distribution: Observe the range of chosen numbers and the frequency of each number. This will give you an idea of how evenly distributed the numbers are.",
        "6": "If there are clusters or outliers: Consider choosing a number that is within a cluster or close to an outlier. This may increase your chances of being close to the target number, as other players may have chosen numbers in the same range.",

        "12": "Adjust your strategy based on your observations: Use the information you gather from observing the distribution of chosen numbers to adjust your own strategy. For example, if you notice that a certain range of numbers is being chosen frequently, you may want to avoid choosing numbers in that range.",

You can try choosing numbers that are closer to the average of all chosen numbers. You can also try choosing numbers that are closer to the winning numbers from previous rounds.",
        "31": "Identify any clusters or gaps: Look for groups of numbers that are close together or areas where there are few or no numbers chosen. Clusters may indicate that players are choosing numbers within a certain range, while gaps may suggest that certain numbers are being avoided.",
