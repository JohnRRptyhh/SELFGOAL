After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Trend Analysis: Analyze the last 5-7 rounds to confirm the consistent decrease in the average. Look for a clear pattern, such as a steady decline or a sudden drop.\n - Quantify the Decline: Measure the rate of decrease by comparing the averages from the last few rounds. This will help you understand how much the average has shifted and how much you need to adjust your strategy.\n - Range Shift: If the average is shifting towards lower numbers, consider whether the range of numbers chosen by the players is also narrowing. This could indicate a shift in strategy or a preference for specific numbers.\n - Probability Calculation: Estimate the probability of the current average being the new average for the next round. This can help you decide if you should stick with your current strategy or adjust based on the likelihood of a continued decrease.\n - Set a Personal Strategy: Develop a strategy that works for you, considering your own strengths and weaknesses. Aim for a number within a range you are comfortable with.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Pattern Confirmation: Analyze the winning numbers in each round to see if there's a consistent pattern. If 25 is the winning number more often than not, it might be worth considering a slightly lower number to stay within the target range but not be too close to the winning number.\n - Be Counterintuitive: If you think they are overestimating the average, you could choose a number slightly below their average to avoid being caught in their trap. However, be cautious not to choose too low, as it might be too far from the actual average.\n - Recent Losses: Player 1 has consistently chosen numbers that were not the winning ones in the last few rounds. This could be a result of wanting to avoid repeating those numbers, which might be perceived as a losing choice.\n - Optimism vs. Pessimism: Player 1 could be either optimistic, believing they can still win despite the recent losses, or pessimistic, thinking that the average is too high and they need to adjust their strategy.\n - Guidelines for the next round: {'Review past winning numbers': 'Focus on the numbers that have led to your victories, and consider choosing a similar but slightly adjusted number.', 'Be cautious of recent trends': 'If the average is consistently higher, choose a number slightly below the average to minimize the risk of being too high.', 'Consider social dynamics': \"Observe other players' choices and adapt your selection if necessary.\", 'Balance optimism and reality': \"Don't let past losses cloud your judgment; maintain a balanced perspective and consider the current average.\", 'Stay flexible': 'If you notice a pattern in the winning numbers, be prepared to deviate from it if the situation changes.'}\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Avoid Extreme Numbers: While you've been successful with numbers close to the winning number, avoid choosing numbers that are too high or too low. This could lead to a higher chance of being off the mark.\n - Trend Detection: Keep track of the average and winning numbers over time. If the average is consistently shifting, adjust your strategy accordingly.\n - Consistency: Maintain a consistent approach. While you've been successful with numbers around 20 and 25, try to stick to this range. This will help you avoid extreme deviations and make it easier for you to predict the average.\n - Stable Average Analysis: Focus on the last 5-6 rounds (Rounds 13-18) where the average is consistently around 23.2. This is the period when you can make a more informed decision based on the trend.\n - Range Calculation: Since the average is around 23.2, you can estimate the target number to be around 14.8. Choose a number slightly below 23, but not too far off to avoid losing.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Emotional Control: Avoid making impulsive decisions based on emotions. Stay calm and objective, and base your choices on the data and patterns you've observed.\n - Tolerance for Error: Understand that sometimes, even the best strategies can lead to losses. Don't let a few losses discourage you from continuing to learn and improve.\n - Set Realistic Goals: If you consistently choose numbers that are too far off the winning range, consider setting a goal to be within a specific number of points of the average in the next few rounds.\n - Pattern Analysis: Identify the numbers that consistently led to losing. In this case, the losing numbers are 32, 38, 28, 27.5, 27, 25, 22.5, 21.6, 25, and 17.5. These numbers might be associated with a higher probability of not being the closest to the target.\n - Diversification: Spread your choices across different ranges to avoid being too predictable. If you notice that players tend to cluster around a specific range, choose numbers from a different area to stand out.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

Analyze the previous rounds to see if there was a change in strategy or a shift in the average.', 'Round 12': 'Your second win with 23 might have been a repeat of the first. Look for any similarities in the circumstances.'}\n - Adapting to the Average: If the average was consistently higher or lower than 2/3, you might have adjusted your strategy to target that range. Look for instances where you did this.\n - Game Dynamics: Consider if the game dynamics changed in any way during the rounds where you won. For example, did the game become more predictable or did the target number change?\n - Average Range Analysis: Keep track of the average numbers when you chose 22 or 23. This will help you understand if there's a specific range where these numbers are more likely to be successful. If the average is consistently higher or lower than the target, adjust your strategy accordingly.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

        "189": "Randomness with Focus: Use a mix of randomness and strategic analysis. For example, you could choose a random number within the target range to avoid being predictable.",
        "190": "Cluster Analysis: Check if there are any clusters of numbers that are consistently chosen by multiple players. Avoid those numbers.",
        "191": "Weighted Average: Consider the relative importance of each round's average. If the winning number was consistently lower than the average, it might suggest that the target is closer to the lower end.",
        "192": "Deviation from Average: Look for the difference between the winning number and the average. If the winning numbers are consistently lower than the average, you might aim for a number slightly above the average to account for the deviation.",
        "193": "Lower Bound Calculation: Estimate the lower limit of the average based on the winning numbers. For example, if the winning numbers have been around 20-25, you might assume that the average could be around 22.5.",
        "194": "Avoiding Overconfidence: Be cautious about choosing numbers that are too high, as they are less likely to be within the target range. Instead, aim for numbers that are slightly below the average but still within the range.",
        "195": "Team Dynamics: If you notice that other players are also avoiding high numbers, you might want to consider joining a strategy where you all focus on the lower range.",
        "196": "Range Optimization: If the average is expected to be close to the lower limit, choose a number that's slightly lower than the estimated average to account for the trend. For instance, aim for a number around 20-21.",
        "197": "Team Dynamics: If you think other players might also be aware of the trend, consider choosing a number that's not too far off the winning numbers but still within the range of your analysis.",

        "203": "Practice and Iterate: Keep playing and refining your strategy. Each round provides an opportunity to learn and adapt.",
        "204": "Historical Analysis: Analyze the changes in the average number over time. If the average is consistently increasing or decreasing, adjust your strategy accordingly. For instance, if the average is trending upwards, you might aim for a lower number to stay closer to the target.",
        "205": "Risk Management: Since you've lost in the past, consider reducing the risk by choosing a number that is slightly higher than the average but still within a reasonable range. This way, you can minimize the chance of being too far off the target.",
        "206": "Adaptive Strategy: Develop a dynamic strategy that adjusts based on the current round's average. For example, if the average is close to 30, you might aim for a number around 25 to account for the 2/3 ratio.",

        "215": "Communication: If you think your choice was influenced by other players' choices, consider communicating with them about the standard deviation and how it might affect your decision-making.",
        "216": "Adaptability: Be prepared to adapt your strategy as the game progresses and the data changes. The standard deviation can be a useful tool for adjusting your approach, but it's not the only factor to consider.",
        "217": "Analyze the Distribution: Look at the distribution of the numbers chosen by the players. Are they mostly clustered around the average, or do they have a wide spread? This can help you identify if there's a pattern or if some players consistently choose higher or lower numbers.",
        "218": "Estimate the Target Range: Based on the standard deviation, you can estimate the range of numbers that are likely to be chosen. If the standard deviation is high, the range might be wider, and you could aim for a number within that range.",
        "219": "Consider the Winning Number: In the previous rounds, the winning number was 32 and 31. These numbers were slightly lower than the target (33.60 and 26.53, respectively). This suggests that players might be underestimating the average, so you could consider choosing a number slightly higher than the average to account for this.",
        "220": "Outlier Detection: Look for numbers that deviate significantly from the average. In the previous rounds, 85 and 55 were outliers. Players might avoid these numbers to avoid losing. Focus on numbers that are more in line with the average.",
        "221": "Frequency Analysis: Analyze the number of times each number was chosen. If a number was chosen more frequently, it might be a better indicator of the average. For instance, if 31 was the winning number in Round 2, it could be a sign that players tend to pick numbers around that range.",
        "222": "Trend Analysis: Examine the trend in the average over the rounds. If the average has been decreasing, it might suggest that players are becoming more cautious and choosing lower numbers. This could be an opportunity to target a slightly lower number in the next round.",
        "223": "Range Optimization: Since the winning numbers are generally lower, consider choosing numbers within the range of 20-40. This will increase the likelihood of being near the target.",
        "224": "Frequency Analysis: Observe the frequency of numbers chosen by other players. If a particular number is chosen more often, it might be a sign that it's a popular choice, but it might not necessarily be the best bet.",
        "225": "Weighted Average: If you have a good understanding of the distribution of numbers, you could assign a weight to each number based on its proximity to the target. This could help you make a more informed decision.",
        "226": "Adaptation: After each round, analyze your performance and adjust your strategy accordingly. If your chosen numbers consistently fall short, you might need to change your approach.",
        "227": "Risk vs. Reward: Assess the risk associated with each number. A number that is too low might not be chosen by others, while a number that's too high could be an outlier. Find a balance between being close to the target and avoiding losing due to low selection.",
        "228": "Randomness with Pattern: Use a combination of randomness and pattern recognition. Choose a number that's not an obvious outlier but still within a range that's likely to be near the target.",
        "229": "Adapt to the Game Master's Strategy: If the game master consistently sets a target that's close to the average, you might need to adjust your strategy accordingly. For example, if the average is consistently around 40, you might aim for a number around 30.",

        "233": "Randomness: Assess the randomness of players' choices. Do some players seem to pick numbers at random, or do they have a specific method?",
        "234": "Strategy Assessment: Consider if any players consistently choose numbers that are slightly lower or higher than the average. This could be a strategy to be close to the target.",
        "235": "Timeframe: Keep track of the time remaining in the round. If there's a limited time, players might be more likely to choose numbers closer to the average to avoid last-minute changes.",
        "236": "Probability Calculation: Estimate the probability of each number based on the distribution of choices. This can help you make a more informed decision.",
        "237": "Target Range Analysis: Analyze the target number (2/3 of the average) and the winning numbers. The winning numbers have been consistently below this target, suggesting that the actual average might be higher than initially expected.",
        "238": "Probability of Overestimation: If the winning numbers are consistently lower, it's possible that players are overestimating the average. This could be due to a higher concentration of numbers around the middle or a few outliers.",
        "239": "Underestimation Strategy: If the winning numbers are lower, consider the possibility that some players might be intentionally choosing lower numbers to be closer to the target. You could try to adopt a similar strategy to increase your chances.",
        "240": "Range Experiment: Try choosing a number slightly higher than the winning numbers from the previous round, as this might be closer to the actual average if the average is indeed higher.",
        "241": "Time-based Strategy: If the average tends to be higher in the later rounds, you might want to consider choosing a number closer to the middle, as the target might be closer to 50.4 (2/3 of 75.6, the average for the last round).",
        "242": "Weighted Average: If the game allows for weighted averages based on the number of players, consider the relative frequency of each player's choices. Players who choose more often might have a greater impact on the overall average.",
        "243": "Randomness vs. Strategy: If some players seem to choose randomly, while others have a clear pattern, adjust your strategy accordingly. If you think the average might be influenced by a few strategic players, focus on numbers that are less likely to be chosen by them.",
        "244": "Consider the Game Master's Influence: The game master might have a bias or a specific way of choosing the target. If you can predict their target, you can adjust your strategy accordingly.",
        "245": "Be Flexible: If the average seems to be shifting, be prepared to adapt your strategy. If the range narrows, you might want to aim for a number closer to the target.",
        "246": "Set a Target Range: Based on your analysis, set a target range for your chosen number. This can help you focus on numbers that are more likely to be within the target range.",
        "247": "Range Analysis: Since the numbers range from 0 to 100, you should consider the distribution of numbers that players have chosen in the past. If the average is likely to be close to the middle, you might focus on numbers around 50.",
        "248": "Range Validation: Since the average was 50.4, and the target is 2/3 of that, focus on numbers between 33.6 and 67.2 (as 2/3 of 50.4 is approximately 33.6). Avoid numbers outside this range, as they are more likely to be too high or low.",
        "249": "Weighted Average: Consider the possibility that the average might be closer to the middle due to the presence of a few high or low numbers. If so, aim for a number slightly below the middle, as it's more likely to be closer to 2/3.",
        "250": "Randomness with Strategy: Use a random number generator with a slight bias towards the lower half of the range. This will help you avoid picking a number that's too high, while still being strategic.",
        "251": "Learn from Loss: Reflect on your previous choice (85) and understand why it was too high. Was it due to overestimating the average, or was there a specific pattern that you misinterpreted? Use this knowledge to adjust your strategy for the next round.",
        "252": "Timeframe: If the game is time-sensitive, consider the time left in the round when making your choice. If there's a limited time, you might need to make a quicker decision without overthinking.",
        "253": "Estimate the Average: Analyze the previous round's average (50.4) and consider if it's likely to increase or decrease in the next round. If the average is expected to rise, a lower number might be more advantageous.",
        "254": "Look for Trends: Check if there are any patterns in the players' choices. If some players consistently pick high numbers, it might be a good idea to avoid those and aim for a slightly lower number.",
        "255": "Weighted Diversification: If the average is expected to remain around 50.4, you could choose a number slightly below 50, like 45, to account for the 2/3 target. However, if the average is expected to shift, choose a number closer to the new average.",
        "256": "Consider the Spread: If the range of numbers is narrow, you might aim for a number slightly below the median, as it's more likely to be closer to 2/3 of the average.",
        "257": "Be Prepared for Unexpected Changes: The game master's statement suggests that the winning number was 32, which was lower than the target. This could indicate that a lower number was closer to the target. However, it's also possible that the average might change.",
        "258": "Test and Adjust: In the next round, try a few different numbers slightly below the average and see how they perform. If they consistently perform well, stick with that strategy. If not, adjust your approach.",
