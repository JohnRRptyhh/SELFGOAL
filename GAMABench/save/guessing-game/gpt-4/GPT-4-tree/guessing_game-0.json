After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Learn from Wins and Losses: You've won a few rounds by choosing numbers close to the target. Analyze what worked in those rounds and try to replicate that success while also considering how the group's behavior has evolved.\n - Adjust for Game Dynamics: Since you won in Round 7 with a 3 and in Round 17 with a 1.5, it seems that the winning number is often close to the previous target number. If players continue to adjust downwards, consider choosing a number slightly lower than the last target number (1.27 in Round 18).\n - Consider Game Theory: Recognize that other players are likely adjusting their strategies based on the trends. The average might stabilize or slightly increase if players overcompensate for the downward trend.\n - Stay Focused on the Target: Remember that your goal is to be closest to 2/3 of the average, not to guess the average itself.\n - Consider Player Behavior: Recognize that other players are also adjusting their strategies. Some may over-adjust, while others may under-adjust. Your goal is to find the sweet spot that accounts for the likely adjustments of others.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

        "2": "Adjust for Game Dynamics: Since you won in Round 7 with a 3 and in Round 17 with a 1.5, it seems that the winning number is often close to the previous target number. If players continue to adjust downwards, consider choosing a number slightly lower than the last target number (1.27 in Round 18).",
        "3": "Consider Game Theory: Recognize that other players are likely adjusting their strategies based on the trends. The average might stabilize or slightly increase if players overcompensate for the downward trend.",
        "4": "Adjust Conservatively: Make smaller, more conservative adjustments based on the most recent rounds rather than the earlier ones.",
        "5": "Stay Focused on the Target: Remember that your goal is to be closest to 2/3 of the average, not to guess the average itself.",

        "7": "Vary Your Choices: You have chosen \"2.0\" several times in the last few rounds. To be unpredictable, consider choosing numbers that you haven't selected before or that are not immediate repeats of your recent choices.",
        "8": "Analyze Patterns of Others: Look for patterns in the numbers chosen by other players. If you notice trends, you can attempt to disrupt these patterns with your selection, which may throw off their predictions about your behavior.",
        "9": "Randomize Within a Range: Instead of choosing a number based on a fixed strategy, you could use a random number generator within a certain range that you believe will be close to 2/3 of the average. This range should be informed by the trends in the previous rounds but should not be too predictable.",
        "10": "Strategic Deviation: Occasionally choose a number that is a strategic deviation from the expected 2/3 of the average. For example, if the average is decreasing, you might choose a number slightly higher than the trend suggests, but not so high as to be an outlier.",
        "11": "Adjust to Game Dynamics: If the average chosen number is consistently decreasing, it might indicate that players are converging towards a lower range. You could choose a number that is slightly higher or lower than the recent winning numbers to maintain unpredictability.",
        "12": "Use Misdirection: If you believe other players are analyzing your choices, you could intentionally choose a number that sends a misleading signal about your strategy, then switch back to a more calculated choice in the following round.",
        "13": "Consider Game Theory: In a game where players are trying to outsmart each other, sometimes the best move is not the one that seems immediately rational. Choosing a number that seems suboptimal could be a way to be unpredictable, especially if others are trying to second-guess you.",

        "18": "Learn from Wins: You won in rounds 7, 17, and 19. Analyze what worked in those rounds. Was it the absolute value of your choice, or was it relative to the trend? Use this insight to inform your next choice.",
        "19": "Psychological Factors: Consider the psychological aspects of the game. Players might overcorrect or undercorrect based on the previous round's results. Try to anticipate these psychological adjustments.",
        "20": "Adjust for Competition: Since you are trying to be the closest to the target number, you need to consider not just the mathematical target but also how to outmaneuver other players who are likely aiming for a similar range.",
        "21": "Monitor Others: If possible, keep track of other players' choices to refine your predictions about the average. This information can be invaluable in adjusting your strategy.",
        "22": "Reflect on Round 7: You won in Round 7 by choosing the exact average number. While this strategy worked once, it may not be reliable if the average continues to decrease. However, it's worth noting that a number close to the average can sometimes be successful.",
        "23": "Incremental Change: If you chose '2.0' in the last round and the winning number was '1.5,' consider choosing a number that is incrementally lower, such as '1.8' or '1.9,' assuming the average continues to decrease slightly.",
        "24": "Consider Player Behavior: Recognize that other players are also adjusting their strategies. Some may over-adjust, while others may under-adjust. Your goal is to find the sweet spot that accounts for the likely adjustments of others.",
        "25": "Avoid Patterns: If you have been consistently choosing numbers that are round or follow a pattern (like always adding 1 to the last target number), consider breaking this pattern to be less predictable.",
        "26": "Consider Player Behavior: Players seem to be converging around a strategy that results in averages that are close to each other in the last few rounds. This could mean that players are using a similar logic to choose their numbers. You should factor this into your prediction for the average.",
        "27": "Incremental Adjustments: If you have been consistently losing by choosing numbers that are too high, make smaller, incremental adjustments rather than drastic changes. This will help you hone in on the winning range without overshooting it.",
        "28": "Adjust for Game Theory Dynamics: As players are trying to guess what others will do, the game becomes a complex exercise in game theory. You may need to think not just about what the average might be, but also about how other players are modifying their strategies.",

        "32": "Use Discrete Steps: Since the numbers are converging, consider using smaller increments or decrements from your last chosen number. For example, if you chose 1.3 in the last round and won, you might want to choose a number very close to this, such as 1.2 or 1.4, depending on your predicted average.",
        "33": "Account for Game Dynamics: Remember that as the game progresses, the range of numbers that can be chosen without going below the target becomes narrower. This might cause the rate of decrease to slow down.",
        "34": "Analyze Winning Numbers: Examine the winning numbers to see if they are also converging towards a particular value. This can help in predicting the range in which future winning numbers might fall.",
        "35": "Adjust Your Strategy: Based on your predictions, adjust your chosen number to be closer to 2/3 of the predicted future average. Remember that as the game progresses, the range of numbers that can win may become narrower.",
        "36": "Prepare for Equilibrium: If the game is reaching an equilibrium where the average number chosen does not change significantly from round to round, you may need to fine-tune your number to be very close to 2/3 of the average.",
        "37": "Consider the Impact of Your Number: Your chosen number affects the average. If the game is close to equilibrium, even a small deviation from the optimal number can have a significant impact on your chances of winning.",
        "38": "Estimate Next Average: Using the rate of convergence, estimate the next average. If the rate of decrease is consistent, you can subtract the average difference from the most recent average to get a rough estimate of the next average.",
        "39": "Adjust for Game Theory: Recognize that as players become more experienced, they may start to think more strategically. This could mean that the rate of decrease in the average might slow down, as players anticipate others choosing lower numbers and adjust their own numbers upwards slightly to hit the target.",
        "40": "Monitor the Range of Choices: Keep an eye on the range of numbers chosen by all players. If the range is narrowing, the game is becoming more competitive, and you may need to choose numbers closer to the predicted target to win.",
        "41": "Aim for the Winning Cluster: If there is a cluster of winning numbers around a certain value, consider choosing numbers close to this cluster, as it may represent a strategic equilibrium point among the players.",
        "42": "Adjust for Game Dynamics: If players are over-adjusting and the numbers are getting too low, the average might start to increase again. Be ready to adjust your number if you see signs of this reversal.",
        "43": "Calculate Ideal Responses: Given the trend, calculate what an ideal response would be if the average continues to decrease. For example, if the average chosen number continues to drop, you might want to choose a number that is slightly lower than your previous choices but still close to the expected target number.",
        "44": "Analyze the Trend: Look at the average numbers chosen in the last few rounds and determine if the downward trend is consistent. Calculate the rate of decrease to predict the next likely average.",
        "45": "Adjust Downward: Since the trend shows a decrease, adjust your calculated 2/3 number slightly downward to account for the possibility that other players are also observing the trend and adjusting their numbers accordingly.",
        "46": "Avoid Anchoring: You have chosen '2.0' and '3.0' multiple times without winning. Avoid anchoring to these numbers and consider a different approach.",
        "47": "Use Discrete Adjustments: Since the averages are getting lower, consider making smaller adjustments to your number choice. For example, if you predict the average will be '2.0', you might choose '1.3' instead of '2.0' to be closer to 2/3 of the average.",
        "48": "Use the Last Winning Number as a Guide: The last few winning numbers have been close to each other (1.8, 1.6). You might use this as a baseline for your next guess, adjusting slightly based on the trend.",
        "49": "Calculate Precisely: Use the exact 2/3 rule to calculate your number. If the average continues to decrease, your number should reflect 2/3 of the predicted average, not just a rough estimate.",
        "50": "Use Game Theory: Consider the principles of game theory, where players are rational and trying to outdo one another. As the game progresses, players may try to outguess each other, leading to more complex patterns of behavior.",
        "51": "Analyze Patterns: Look at the numbers you've chosen in the past and identify any patterns. For instance, you have chosen '3.0' several times and '2.0' multiple times as well. Other players may expect you to choose numbers around these values.",
        "52": "Assess Winning Numbers: Notice the winning numbers and how they have gradually decreased over time. This trend suggests that players are collectively learning and adjusting their strategies to choose lower numbers.",
        "53": "Calculate Optimal Range: Based on the trend of the average numbers chosen, determine a range where the target number is likely to fall. This will help you narrow down your choices.",
        "54": "Introduce Variability: To become less predictable, you can vary your choices within the optimal range you've calculated. Avoid sticking to round numbers like '2.0' or '3.0' since they are common choices and may be anticipated by others.",
        "55": "Aim for Consistency: While the winning number fluctuates, aiming for consistency in your choices relative to the declining average may increase your chances of winning.",
        "56": "Learn from Success: Analyze the round you won and understand what factors contributed to that success. Was it a change in your strategy, or did the other players' choices align with your prediction?",
        "57": "Consider the Lower Bound: Recognize that as the average approaches zero, the rate of decline may not be linear. Players may hesitate to choose zero, causing the average to stabilize at a low number above zero. Adjust your predictions accordingly.",
        "58": "Learn from Success: You won in Round 7 by choosing a number equal to the target number. While this may not always be the winning strategy, it suggests that being very close to the target number can be successful.",
        "59": "Consider Rationality Limits: Players may not act perfectly rationally, and there may be a lower bound above zero that players converge to. Consider the psychological factors at play, such as players avoiding the lowest numbers for fear of not being the closest to 2/3 of the average.",
        "60": "Consider the Winning Range: Look at the range around the target number that has been winning. If there is a consistent range, aim within that range to increase your chances of winning.",
        "61": "Avoid Anchoring to Past Choices: While you won with a choice of 3.0 in round 7, the average has continued to decrease. Avoid anchoring to this past choice and instead focus on the current trend.",
        "62": "Apply Iterative Reasoning: Recognize that other players are also observing these trends and adjusting their strategies. Use iterative reasoning to predict how others might change their choices and adjust your number accordingly.",
        "63": "Pattern Recognition: Identify any patterns in the winning numbers. It seems that the winning number is often close to the target number but slightly higher. Use this information to adjust your guess accordingly.",
        "64": "Aim Close to Past Targets: The winning numbers have been close to or slightly above the target number. Aim for a number that is near the target, but with a slight increase to account for the possibility of others guessing lower numbers.",
        "65": "Statistical Reasoning: Use the concept of regression toward the mean to inform your guess. If the last round's average was unusually low or high, it might be reasonable to expect the next average to be closer to the overall mean of the previous rounds.",
        "66": "Winning Strategy Replication: You have won three rounds with numbers 3.0, 1.5, and 1.3. Analyze what worked in those rounds and see if there is a pattern that can be replicated or adjusted slightly for the current round.",
        "67": "Margin of Error: Establish a margin of error based on past results. If the winning number is consistently within a certain range above the target, use this range to inform your next guess.",
        "68": "Consistency Check: Look at your own past numbers and see if there is a consistent overestimation or underestimation on your part. Adjust your strategy to correct for any personal bias.",
        "69": "Opponent Adjustment: If you notice certain players are consistently choosing numbers that influence the average significantly, consider how their next move might affect the outcome and adjust your prediction accordingly.",
        "70": "Last Round Strategy: As the game progresses, especially in the last few rounds, players might change their strategies. Be prepared to adapt quickly to any sudden changes in the pattern.",
        "71": "Analyze Recent Trends: Look at the average numbers chosen in rounds 13 to 17 to identify any patterns or trends. This will help you predict the average for the next round more accurately.",
        "72": "Estimate the Target Number: Based on the recent average, estimate the target number for the next round by calculating 2/3 of 1.808, which is approximately 1.205.",
        "73": "Adjust Your Guess Based on Player Behavior: Players seem to be converging towards lower numbers as the game progresses. This means you should adjust your guess downwards, but not too much as to overshoot the 2/3 target.",
        "74": "Use the Iterated Elimination of Dominated Strategies (IEDS): In this game, choosing a number higher than 66 is a dominated strategy because 2/3 of 100 (the maximum choice) is 66.67, and you expect the average to be lower. As the game progresses, you can iteratively eliminate higher numbers based on the observed averages.",
        "75": "Be Adaptive: If you win a round, consider sticking close to that number in the next round, as it might still be a good guess if players' behavior doesn't change much. If you lose, adjust your guess slightly, but keep in mind the overall trends.",
        "76": "Consider Player Behavior: Players may be adjusting their strategies as well, so consider the possibility of a shift in the average if players decide to change their number selections drastically.",
        "77": "Avoid Anchoring Bias: Don't let your previous choices overly influence your current decision. Just because you chose a certain number in the past doesn't mean it's the right choice for the current round.",
        "78": "Aim for the Middle: If you're unsure, aiming for a number near the middle of your predicted target range can be a safe bet, as it minimizes the risk of being too far off from the winning number.",
        "79": "Fine-Tune Your Selection: Adjust your selection slightly above the strict 2/3 prediction to account for potential slowing in the trend of decreasing averages.",
        "80": "Be Prepared to Shift Strategy: If you notice a sudden change in the pattern, such as an unexpected increase in the average number chosen, be ready to shift your strategy accordingly.",
        "81": "Refine Your Choice: Based on the trend and player behavior, refine your choice to be competitive. If the average continues to decrease, you might want to choose a number that is slightly lower than your preliminary target to account for this.",
        "82": "Refine Strategy Over Time: Use each round as a learning opportunity to refine your strategy. If you find that your predictions are consistently off, reevaluate your approach to estimating the average and choosing your number.",
        "83": "Calculate Your Choice: Based on the trend, calculate 2/3 of the average number from the last round or a slightly lower number to account for the trend of decreasing choices. Use this as a starting point for your selection.",
        "84": "Adjust for Game Dynamics: Since you are trying to guess 2/3 of the average, including your own number, you should consider how your choice will affect the average. If you choose a number significantly lower than the previous average, it could skew the results.",
        "85": "Consider the Range of Winning Numbers: Look at the range within which the winning numbers have fallen and try to choose a number within that range, adjusting for the trend.",
        "86": "Be Adaptive: If you notice a shift in the pattern (e.g., the average starts increasing), be ready to adapt your strategy accordingly. Flexibility is key in a dynamic game.",
        "87": "Consider Player Aversion to Fractions: Winning numbers have been whole numbers, suggesting players may avoid choosing fractions. You might increase your chances by also selecting whole numbers close to your calculated target.",
        "88": "Consider the Influence of Round Number: As the game progresses, players may become more conservative in their choices, aiming to stay close to previous winning numbers rather than risk a more aggressive strategy.",
        "89": "Consider Psychological Factors: Players may have a psychological comfort zone that prevents them from choosing numbers that are too low. Factor this into your decision by not choosing a number that is too far from the numbers that have been winning.",
        "90": "Maintain Flexibility: Be ready to change your strategy if the trend reverses or if you notice a new pattern emerging in the players' choices.",
        "91": "Avoid Anchoring to Round Numbers: Players may have a bias towards choosing round numbers (like 2, 3, 5, etc.). Consider choosing a number that is not a round number to potentially get closer to the target.",
        "92": "Be Conservative: Given the small range of recent averages and target numbers, it might be wise to make conservative changes to your chosen number rather than drastic ones.",
        "93": "Be Mindful of Group Dynamics: If you notice that players are consistently choosing numbers within a certain range, it may be beneficial to select a number just inside this range to capitalize on the group's psychological tendencies.",
        "94": "Establish a Lower Bound: Based on the trend, determine a lower bound that players seem hesitant to go below. For example, if the average is approaching 3 but not going below it, this might be a psychological or strategic lower limit for the players.",
        "95": "Estimate Player Adjustment: Given that the average has been consistently decreasing, players may anticipate a need to adjust their numbers upwards to avoid going too low. Consider this potential adjustment when making your selection.",
        "96": "Consider the Winning Gap: Notice the gap between the average and the winning number. If the gap is narrowing, players are getting better at estimating the target number. If it's widening, there may be more variability in player choices.",
        "97": "Adapt to Victory: You won in Round 7 by choosing a number that was exactly the average. Consider how this strategy might work in the current round, but be cautious as players may adjust their numbers based on your previous win.",
        "98": "Reflect on Your Performance: You won in Round 7 by choosing a number exactly equal to the winning number. Reflect on what was different about your strategy or the circumstances of that round compared to others.",
        "99": "Consider Player Behavior: Players may be influenced by the results of previous rounds. If they see that the winning number is often below the average, they might choose even lower numbers. Anticipate this behavior in your decision-making.",
        "100": "Avoid Round Numbers: Players may be inclined to choose round numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3). Since you have chosen '3.0' multiple times without success, consider choosing a non-round number that is not an integer to avoid ties and to stand out from the pattern.",
        "101": "Diversify Your Choices: Since you have won with '3.0' once but lost with it multiple times, it might be time to diversify your choices. If the trend continues, a number lower than '3.0' but not as low as '2.0' might be a safer bet.",
        "102": "Calculate 2/3 Value: Based on your estimated new average, calculate 2/3 of that value to determine a potential target number.",
        "103": "Choose Dynamically: Be ready to adjust your choice dynamically, rather than sticking to a fixed number or a narrow range of numbers.",
        "104": "Use a Range: Instead of focusing on a single number, consider a range of numbers around your calculated 2/3 value that could potentially be winning numbers. This allows for some flexibility in your choice.",
        "105": "Learn from Success: You won in Round 7 by choosing '3.0' when the average was 3.6. Consider what might have changed since then and how you can replicate the success under current conditions.",
        "106": "Calculate Precisely: Use the exact 2/3 multiplier on your estimated average rather than rounding to whole numbers, as the winning numbers are often not whole numbers.",
        "107": "Narrow Your Range: Given the decreasing averages, narrow your range of potential choices to the lower end of the spectrum, but be mindful not to go too low as to be out of the competitive range.",
        "108": "Stay Rational: Remember that each round is independent, and while trends can inform your decision, each choice should be made based on the current game state and not solely on past outcomes.",
        "109": "Use a Probabilistic Model: If you have the capability, you could use a probabilistic model to predict the average number based on the previous choices. This could be a simple regression model or a more complex predictive model that takes into account the trend and variance in the numbers chosen.",
        "110": "Prepare for Variability: While there is a trend, there is also variability in the numbers chosen. Be prepared for the possibility that some players may choose numbers that deviate from the trend, which could affect the average and the target.",
        "111": "Psychological Play: Consider the psychological aspect of the game. Some players might stick to a certain pattern or strategy. If you can identify any consistent behaviors, use that knowledge to refine your prediction of the average.",
        "112": "Mathematical Approach: If you believe that players are rational and will continue to follow the trend logically, you might use a mathematical model to predict the next average. However, remember that human behavior can be unpredictable, and not all players may act rationally.",
        "113": "Avoid Anchoring Bias: Your choice in Round 8 may have been influenced by the success in Round 7. This is known as anchoring bias, where you rely too heavily on a previous piece of information. Aim to evaluate each round independently, based on the overall trend rather than the outcome of the previous round.",
        "114": "Maintain Flexibility: Be prepared to adjust your strategy if the trend changes. If you notice a sudden increase in the average number chosen, be ready to adapt your prediction for the target number.",
        "115": "Use a Range: Instead of choosing a single number, consider a range around the expected target that you believe will increase your chances of winning. This accounts for variability in other players' choices.",
        "116": "Statistical Analysis: If possible, use statistical methods to analyze the choices of other players and predict the next average more accurately. This could involve calculating the mean decrease per round and using it to forecast the next average.",
        "117": "Stay Rational: Ensure that your choices are based on logical deductions and predictions rather than emotional reactions to winning or losing.",
        "118": "Aim for Consistency: While it's important to adapt, also aim for a consistent strategy that can yield the best results over multiple rounds. Avoid drastic changes unless the game dynamics significantly change.",
        "119": "Analyze Trends: Look at the rate of decrease in the average number chosen. If the rate of decrease is slowing down, it may indicate that players are reaching a lower bound of their comfort zone and might not be willing to go much lower.",
        "120": "Calculate the Ideal Number: Based on the previous averages, calculate what the ideal number would have been to win each round. Look for patterns in how far off the winning number was from the actual 2/3 average.",
        "121": "Set a Threshold: Determine a threshold number that you believe players will not go below. This could be based on psychological factors (e.g., players might not want to choose numbers below 1) or game dynamics (e.g., the winning number has hovered around a certain point for several rounds).",
        "122": "Monitor the Winning Number: If the winning number starts to increase, it could be an early sign of a reversal. Use this information to inform your choice in the next round.",
        "123": "Be Adaptive: Be ready to adapt your strategy each round based on the new information. If you see evidence of a reversal, be one of the first to adjust accordingly to gain an advantage.",
        "124": "Communicate: If there is any form of communication allowed between players, use it to gauge their thoughts and potentially influence the average.",

        "197": "Anticipate Convergence: As the game progresses, players are likely to converge towards a strategy that they feel is most successful. This could mean that the numbers chosen will become lower and closer together as players aim for the 2/3 target. Expect a downward trend in the average number chosen.",
        "198": "Consider Psychological Anchoring: Players might anchor around certain numbers that have won in previous rounds or around numbers that are close to the target from the last round. Be aware of these potential anchors when making your prediction.",

        "262": "Aim for the Theoretical Optimal: While the theoretical optimal choice is 0, given the convergence of rational players, aim for a number that is close to 2/3 of the recent averages, as this is more likely to be the winning number in practice.",
        "263": "Monitor the Winning Number: Keep an eye on the number that wins each round. If it stabilizes around a certain value, consider targeting numbers close to 2/3 of that value, as it may indicate a behavioral equilibrium among the players.",
        "264": "Prepare for Endgame: As the game progresses, players may change their strategies, especially as they become more desperate to win in the final rounds. Be prepared for potentially erratic behavior as the end approaches and adjust your strategy to maintain an edge.",

        "266": "Choose Conservatively: To avoid overshooting the target number, you might opt for a conservative number that is slightly lower than the calculated target, as this could give you a buffer in case the actual average is lower than your prediction.",
        "267": "Reflect on Your Position: As player_0, you have no information about others' choices in the current round. Therefore, your decision should be based on historical data and the assumption that others are trying to optimize their choices as well.",

If all players are rational and aiming for the target, the game should theoretically converge towards a number where everyone chooses the theoretical target.

        "279": "Avoid Extremes: Given that the winning number was 22.0, choosing a number too far from this could be risky. Avoid selecting numbers that are at the extremes (close to 0 or 100) unless you have a strong reason to believe the average will shift significantly.",
        "280": "Consider Convergence: In repeated games, players often converge towards an equilibrium. If the game is converging, the numbers chosen by players might become more clustered around a certain range. Aim for a number within this converging range.",

        "282": "Observe Patterns: If you notice any patterns in the numbers chosen by other players, use this information to refine your prediction of the average.",
        "283": "Maintain Flexibility: Be ready to adjust your strategy in subsequent rounds based on the outcomes of each round. Flexibility is key in managing risk effectively.",

        "287": "Analyze Past Behavior: Review the average number chosen (28.4) and consider how it reflects the collective behavior of the players. Since the winning number was 22.0, which is below the average, players may be leaning towards lower numbers in their selections.",
        "288": "Observe Winning Trends: The winning number was 22.0, which was not exactly 2/3 of the average (18.93), but it was the closest.

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Account for Variability: There is always some variability in the choices of players due to different strategies or random factors. Incorporate a margin of error in your calculations to account for this variability.\n - Observe the Rate of Decline: Notice that the average number chosen by players is generally decreasing over time. Calculate the rate of decline and use this to estimate the next likely average.\n - Use Statistical Analysis: Apply simple statistical tools like moving averages or linear regression to the past averages to predict the next average more accurately.\n - Refine Your Estimation: Use the data from previous rounds to refine your estimation of what 2/3 of the average might be. Since you have a history of the averages and winning numbers, you can use this to inform your next choice.\n - Stay Agile: Be ready to change your strategy if you notice a shift in the other players' behavior. If the average suddenly increases or decreases more than expected, you should be prepared to adjust your number choice accordingly.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

        "189": "Use the 2/3 Rule: Since the target is 2/3 of the average, you could apply the 2/3 rule to your own choice. For example, if you expect the average to be around 8 (based on the last round), you might choose 2/3 of that, which would be approximately 5.33. Adjust this number slightly upwards to account for the pattern of winning numbers being higher than the target.",

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Implement a Responsive Strategy: Be ready to adapt your strategy each round based on the outcomes and behaviors observed in the previous rounds. This might mean not sticking to a fixed number but rather choosing a number that responds to the evolving game dynamics.\n - Calculate Precisely: Use the exact 2/3 of the average from the previous round as a starting point for your prediction, rather than rounding up or choosing a familiar number. Precision can make a difference in a game with such small margins.\n - Estimate the Next Average: Given the downward trend, you can attempt to estimate the next average by considering the rate of decrease in the average numbers. However, since the numbers are already quite low, the rate of decrease might slow down.\n - Estimate Recursive Thinking Levels: Try to estimate how many levels of thinking the other players are using. If you believe the other players are at level-1 thinking (they choose 2/3 of the previous average), you might want to be at level-2 (choosing 2/3 of the 2/3 average). However, if players are deeper in their reasoning, you may need to adjust further.\n - Analyze Trends: Look at the historical data to identify any patterns in the average numbers chosen and the winning numbers. Notice that the averages are generally decreasing, which suggests players are adapting and choosing lower numbers over time.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

However, since you are also a part of the average, subtract your influence from the total before multiplying by 2/3 to find your optimal number. For example, if you expect the average to be around 15 based on your predictions, the target number would be 10 (2/3 of 15). If there are 10 players, the total without your number would be 15 * 9 = 135. To not influence the average upward, you might choose a number slightly below 10.",
        "228": "Adjust Your Strategy: If you assume that players will adjust their numbers down, you might consider choosing a number that is 2/3 of a lower predicted average.

        "247": "Adapt Based on Previous Wins: Your winning number in Round 2 was 15, which was higher than the target. This might indicate that players tend to choose numbers higher than the target. You could consider this factor and adjust your number slightly upwards.",
        "248": "Apply the 2/3 Rule More Accurately: Ensure that you are applying the 2/3 multiplier correctly. If you predict an average of, say, 20, then your choice should be around 2/3 of 20, which is approximately 13.33.",
        "249": "Balance Risk and Conservatism: If you believe players will continue to lower their numbers, you might want to choose a number slightly lower than the last winning number but not so low that it's risky if the average doesn't decrease as much as you expect.",

        "258": "Consider the Range of Error: Reflect on how close the winning number was to the target number in the previous round. The winning number was 22.0, and the target was 18.93. This suggests a range of error that you might want to consider when selecting your number.",
        "259": "Avoid Extremes: Since you won the last round with a number that was not the exact 2/3 of the average, it might be wise to avoid choosing a number that is exactly 2/3 of your predicted average, as other players might gravitate towards that number. Instead, select a number slightly above or below to give yourself a unique position.",

        "272": "Risk Management: Balance the potential reward of selecting a number very close to your predicted target against the risk of being far off if your prediction is incorrect. Choose a slightly safer number that is less likely to win but more likely to be close to the target.",
        "273": "Consider Player Behavior: If you have access to more detailed logs from previous rounds, analyze the choices of individual players. Look for patterns such as consistently choosing round numbers, numbers ending in 5 or 0, or numbers within a certain range.",
        "274": "Estimate Player Behavior: If players are rational and adaptive, they will likely continue to lower their choices. However, not all players may adjust at the same rate. Some may overcorrect, while others may be slower to change. Estimate a range of numbers you believe the other players might choose based on their learning curve.",
        "275": "Prepare for Variability: There may be variability in the numbers chosen by players due to different rates of learning or strategic experimentation. Be prepared for some fluctuation in the average and target numbers.",
        "276": "Monitor Round-to-Round Changes: Keep a close eye on how much the average number changes from round to round. If the change starts to stabilize, it may indicate that players have found an equilibrium. If it continues to decrease, you may need to continue lowering your chosen number.",
        "277": "Choose a Strategic Number: Based on your analysis, choose a number that is 2/3 of your new estimated average. If you believe players will continue to overestimate, you might choose a number slightly higher than the strict 2/3 calculation but still lower than the previous average.",
        "278": "Consider the Influence of Your Choice: Your choice also affects the average. If you choose a number significantly lower or higher than the previous average, it could shift the target number. Decide whether you want to play conservatively (close to the previous average) or more aggressively (farther from the previous average to influence the target).",

The Nash equilibrium for this game, assuming fully rational players, is for everyone to choose zero. However, since players may not be fully rational or may not have reached equilibrium yet, you should not jump straight to zero but consider a gradual approach towards lower numbers.",

        "285": "Randomize Within the Range: Choose a random number within your calculated 2/3 range. Ensure that the randomization process is truly random to maintain unpredictability. You might use a random number generator or another method that does not follow a discernible pattern.",
        "286": "Adjust for Game Dynamics: Be prepared to adjust your strategy in subsequent rounds based on the outcomes and any new patterns that emerge. If players start to anticipate the decreasing trend and adjust upwards, you'll need to be ready to recalibrate your range.",
        "287": "Estimate the Equilibrium: The theoretical equilibrium in this game, assuming rational players, would be where everyone chooses zero, making the average zero and 2/3 of the average also zero. However, reaching this point depends on all players being perfectly rational and fully trusting that others will also choose zero. Given the trend, players are moving towards lower numbers but have not reached zero.",
        "288": "Choose a Proactive Number: Based on your prediction of the next average, choose a number that is 2/3 of that predicted average.

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Stay Dynamic: While some players may have reached a saturation point, others may still be experimenting. Be prepared to adapt if you notice a sudden change in the average number chosen.\n - Fine-Tune Your Predictions: Given the convergence trend, you should adjust your predictions for the average number downward with each round, but not so drastically as to overshoot the 2/3 target.\n - Stay Close to Past Winning Numbers: Your winning numbers have often been very close to the target number. Use the winning numbers from past rounds as a reference point, but adjust slightly downward to account for the overall trend of decreasing averages.\n - Avoid Recent Winners: If the trend shows that the immediate past winning number is not chosen as a winner in the subsequent round, you might avoid choosing 1.3 (the winning number from Round 19) and consider numbers that have not been winning numbers in the last few rounds.\n - Calculate the 2/3 Target: For the last few rounds, calculate the 2/3 target and compare it to the winning numbers. Notice if the winning numbers are consistently above, below, or exactly at the 2/3 target.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

Avoid going too far below the expected target to prevent being too far off the mark.",
        "85": "Prepare for Ties: As the range of numbers narrows, the likelihood of ties increases. Have a strategy for tie-breaking. This could involve choosing a number that is not a whole number (e.g., 1.5 instead of 2) to differentiate your choice from others who might opt for whole numbers.",
        "86": "Avoid Patterns: If you have been consistently choosing certain numbers (like 3.0 in rounds 10 and 11), consider changing your pattern to avoid predictability, as other players might also be analyzing these patterns.",

        "105": "Use Historical Data: The winning numbers from the last few rounds have been 3, 3, 2. You might use these as a basis for your next choice, adjusting slightly downward to account for the trend but not so much that you risk being too far from the target if the average stabilizes or increases slightly.",
        "106": "Use Game Theory: Consider the principles of game theory, where players are rational and will try to optimize their chances of winning. This might lead to a convergence around a number that is slightly lower than the last winning number, as players anticipate others to choose numbers around that range.",
        "107": "Stay Ahead of the Curve: If the trend continues and players keep lowering their numbers, choosing a number slightly lower than your last winning number could be a good strategy. However, don't go too low, as you want to stay close to the 2/3 target.",

        "243": "Change Strategies: If you have been using a particular strategy (e.g., choosing numbers close to the previous round's average), consider changing your approach. For instance, you might switch to targeting numbers closer to the previous target number or another strategy that players are not expecting.",
        "244": "Avoid Round Numbers: Players may be inclined to choose round numbers (e.g., 10, 15, 20). By selecting numbers that are not round, you may increase your unpredictability.",

        "250": "Estimate Convergence: Given that the winning number decreased from 22.0 in Round 1 to 15.0 in Round 2, you can infer that players are likely adjusting their strategies. You might estimate where the convergence point might be if players continue to adjust their numbers downward.",
        "251": "Predict Rational Behavior: If players are rational, they will likely continue to choose lower numbers to approach the Nash equilibrium. You can use this assumption to adjust your own choice. However, keep in mind that not all players may be rational or have a perfect understanding of the game.",
        "252": "Choose Conservatively: Since you won the first round and were close in the second, a conservative approach might be to choose a number slightly lower than your last choice but not too low, as you want to account for the possibility that not all players will significantly lower their numbers.",
        "253": "Consider the Range of Choices: If you believe some players might still choose higher numbers, you might want to select a number that is not at the extreme low end of potential choices. This could protect you from being too far off if the average doesn't decrease as much as you expect.",
        "254": "Adjust for Player Behavior: If you notice that players are influenced by the previous round's winning number, you might consider how your number could influence the next round. Choosing a number that steers the average in a direction beneficial to you could be a subtle way to influence the game.",
        "255": "Prepare for Non-Equilibrium Play: While the Nash equilibrium is a theoretical optimal point, real players may not play optimally. Be ready to adapt your strategy if you notice that players are not behaving as game theory would predict.",
        "256": "Communicate (if allowed): If the game rules permit communication between players, you might try to subtly influence their choices or gather information about their thought processes to better inform your own choice.",
        "257": "Reflect on Game Dynamics: Consider how the dynamics of the game might change as players become more familiar with the strategy. Players might start to second-guess each other, leading to more complex patterns of behavior.",
        "258": "Reflect on Your Winning Choice: You won the previous round with a choice of 22. Other players may consider adjusting their choices closer to this number, expecting it to be a successful strategy again. You might need to decide whether to stick with a similar number or adjust it slightly to account for others' potential adjustments.",
        "259": "Anticipate Convergence: As the game progresses, players are likely to converge on a range of numbers that have been successful in the past. You may want to choose a number slightly lower than what you predict the average to be, assuming others are thinking similarly and the overall average will decrease.",
        "260": "Maintain Flexibility: Be prepared to adapt your strategy each round based on the outcomes and any new patterns that emerge. Flexibility is key in a dynamic game where player strategies are constantly evolving.",
        "261": "Avoid Extremes: Unless you have a strong reason to believe that the average will shift significantly, it may be wise to avoid choosing numbers at the extreme ends of the spectrum, as they are less likely to be close to 2/3 of the average.",
        "262": "Psychological Play: If you believe other players are influenced by your previous win, you might consider a slight deviation from your last winning number to account for their adjustments.",
        "263": "Reflect on Psychological Anchoring: Your winning number from the last round might serve as an anchor for other players. They might adjust their choices relative to the number 22.0. You could anticipate this and adjust your number accordingly.",
        "264": "Adjust for Overcorrection: If players are overcorrecting by choosing numbers significantly lower than the previous average, you might find an opportunity by not lowering your number as much, or even slightly increasing it.",
        "265": "Avoid Predictability: Since you won the last round, other players might expect you to choose a similar number. Consider changing your number to avoid being too predictable.",
        "266": "Estimate the New Average: Based on the previous rounds, try to estimate the new average. If players are learning and adapting, the average might be lower. Choose a number that is 2/3 of your estimated new average.",
        "267": "Consider the Impact of Your Choice: Remember that your choice affects the average. If you choose a lower number, it will pull the average down, and vice versa. Make sure to factor this into your calculations.",
        "268": "Monitor Player Elimination: If the game involves eliminating the farthest players from the target number, the dynamics might change as players are eliminated. The remaining players might be those who are better at predicting the average, which could lead to a lower overall average.",
        "269": "Collaboration or Competition: Depending on your understanding of the game dynamics, you might consider forming alliances or understanding the competitive landscape. This could involve communicating with other players to influence their choices or to gain insights into their strategies, much like humans form social bonds or compete with others to achieve survival-related goals.",
        "270": "Avoid Outliers: Since you won the previous round with a number that was not too far from the target, it suggests that extreme numbers (very high or very low) may not be the best strategy. Aim to choose a number that is conservative relative to the expected average to minimize the risk of being far from the target.",
        "271": "Consider Regression to the Mean: If the previous rounds have shown a wide range of numbers, there might be a tendency for the average to regress towards the middle of the range (50) in subsequent rounds. Adjust your choice to account for this possibility.",
        "272": "Adjust for Game Dynamics: If you notice that players are adjusting their numbers based on previous outcomes, consider how this might affect the average. For example, if players tend to lower their numbers after a round with a high average, you might want to choose a slightly lower number to stay close to the target.",
        "273": "Calculate Conservatively: Since the target number is 2/3 of the average, a conservative approach would be to choose a number that you estimate will be close to 2/3 of the midpoint of the range of numbers you expect to be chosen. This helps to manage risk by not relying too heavily on extreme predictions.",
        "274": "Monitor Player Behavior: Pay attention to any changes in the behavior of individual players, especially if they have been consistently choosing numbers far from the average. Their adjustments could significantly impact the average and, consequently, the target number.",
        "275": "Optimize Your Number: If you have a model of the other players' behavior, you can use it to optimize your chosen number. For example, if you expect the average to decrease based on previous rounds, you might choose a number slightly lower than the one that won you the last round.",
        "276": "Efficiency: To maximize your chances of winning, you would want to make your selections as efficiently as possible, minimizing the time and effort spent on each decision while still making a well-informed choice. This reflects the human tendency to conserve energy and resources for survival.",
        "277": "Analyze Winning Patterns: Consider whether your winning number might influence other players. They might think that choosing numbers close to 22 could be a successful strategy, potentially lowering the average for the next round.",
        "278": "Consider Behavioral Consistency: Look for patterns in individual player behavior. Do some players consistently choose higher or lower numbers? Do they tend to stick close to previous winning numbers? Identifying such tendencies can help refine your prediction of the average.",
        "279": "Assess Round Influence: Recognize that players might be influenced by the results of the most recent round. They may adjust their choices downward, expecting others to do the same in an attempt to get closer to 2/3 of the average. You should factor this potential shift into your decision.",
        "280": "Predict Adjustment Strategies: Anticipate larger shifts from players who chose numbers far from the winning number, which could affect the average.",
        "281": "Refine Your Choice: Refine your choice for the next round based on the above considerations. If you expect the average to decrease due to players adjusting their numbers downward, you might choose a lower number than in the previous round to stay close to the new target."

This suggests that your predictions were well-aligned with the game dynamics at those points.\n - Use Game Theory: Consider the principles of game theory, which suggest that in a game of strategy, players will try to outdo one another by thinking ahead. Assume that other players are also analyzing the trends and will adjust their numbers accordingly.\n - Calculate the Range of 2/3 Averages: Calculate the 2/3 value for each of the recent round averages to understand the range within which the winning numbers have been falling. This will give you a sense of where the target number might be in the next round.\n - Learn from Your Own Outcomes: Reflect on the rounds you won and lost, and analyze what worked and what didn't in your number selection. Use this self-reflection to improve your strategy for the upcoming round.\n - Monitor Round-to-Round Changes: Keep track of how the average and winning numbers shift from round to round.

This could be as simple as adding or subtracting a small random value from your usual choice. Ensure that the randomizing element still aligns with your overall strategy and keeps you within a competitive range.",
        "57": "Reflect on Game Theory: Remember that this game is a form of the 'beauty contest' game, a common game theory problem. The equilibrium strategy, if everyone is rational and has common knowledge of rationality, is to choose '0'. However, since players are learning and adapting, the equilibrium may not be reached. Use this knowledge to inform your strategy.",
        "58": "Avoid Patterns: If you have been consistently choosing a certain way (e.g., always rounding up or down), consider breaking the pattern to avoid predictability.",

        "74": "Monitor Round-to-Round Changes: Pay attention to how much the average number changes from round to round. Smaller changes might indicate that the numbers are stabilizing, while larger changes could signal a shift in strategy among players.",
        "75": "Choose Below the Last Winner: Since the last winning number was 3.0, consider choosing a number slightly below this, but not below the last target number (2.27). A safe range might be between 2.3 and 2.9, depending on how aggressive you want to be.",
        "76": "Adjust for Game Dynamics: If you believe players might anchor to round numbers (like 3.0), you might choose a number just below a round number (e.g., 2.9). If you think players will continue to follow the trend strictly, you might choose closer to your estimated target number.",

Recognize that the group's behavior is not yet at the equilibrium, which means there is still predictability in the numbers being chosen.",
        "215": "Consider the Direction of Change: If players are rational and learning, they should adjust their numbers downward. Anticipate a lower average in the next round. Adjust your own number selection to be closer to 2/3 of the anticipated new average.",
        "216": "Calculate a Predictive Target: If the trend continues, estimate a further reduction in the average number chosen. Calculate 2/3 of your predicted average to determine a new target number.",
        "217": "Anticipate Convergence: Recognize that as players learn from previous rounds, their numbers may start to converge around a certain range. Be prepared to adjust your choice accordingly.",
        "218": "Avoid Round-Specific Numbers: Do not focus on the winning numbers or the exact target numbers from previous rounds, as these are results of specific circumstances that may not repeat.",
        "219": "Consider Psychological Factors: Players may exhibit psychological biases such as avoiding extremes or gravitating towards certain 'safe' numbers. Be aware of these tendencies and how they might influence the next round's average.",
        "220": "Set a Range: Instead of fixating on a single number, consider a range of numbers that could potentially be close to 2/3 of the next round's average. This can help mitigate the risk of being too far off the target.",
        "221": "Consider Player Behavior: Recognize that as the game progresses, players are likely to become more strategic and conservative in their choices. Factor in the possibility of overcorrection, where players might adjust their numbers too much based on the last round's results.",
        "222": "Observe and Adapt: Be prepared to continue the process of adaptation in subsequent rounds, using each round's results as new data to inform your strategy. Stay flexible and ready to adjust your predictions as players converge towards the Nash equilibrium.",
        "223": "Maintain a Competitive Edge: While adapting your strategy, consider how other players might also be adapting theirs. Try to stay one step ahead in the prediction game. If the game has multiple rounds remaining, consider using this round as additional data to refine your strategy further, rather than immediately trying to win.",
        "224": "Calculate a Conservative Estimate: To play conservatively, aim for a number that is safely within the lower third of the range, given that the winning number was 22.0 and the target was 18.93. A conservative estimate might be to choose a number slightly lower than your previous choice but not too low, as to avoid overshooting if other players also adjust downwards.",
        "225": "Consider a Moderate Approach: If you believe players will not drastically change their behavior, you might opt for a moderate number that is closer to the previous winning number. This approach assumes some players will continue to choose higher numbers, keeping the average from dropping too much.",
        "226": "Adjust for Aggressive Play: If you decide to play more aggressively, you might choose a number significantly lower than the previous average, betting that others will also lower their choices and thus lower the average. This is riskier because if you misjudge other players' adjustments, you could end up far from the target.",
        "227": "Set a Target Range: Instead of fixating on a single number, consider a range of numbers that could potentially be close to the target. This range should be based on your predictions of the other players' behavior and the previous round's results.",
        "228": "Prepare to Adapt: Be ready to adapt your strategy in subsequent rounds based on the outcomes of this round. Keep track of how the average is trending and how close the winning numbers are to the target.",
        "229": "Collaboration or Competition: Considering whether to form tacit alliances with other players by aiming for numbers that are strategically aligned or directly competing by attempting to outguess others. Deciding if and when to break from any patterns that may have formed among the group to gain an advantage.",
        "230": "Consider Anchoring Effects: The average number from the previous round was 28.4, and the winning number was 22.0. Consider if players might anchor around these numbers in the next round, either by choosing numbers close to them or by adjusting their choices based on these reference points.",
        "231": "Evaluate Risk Aversion: Determine if players are generally risk-averse, preferring to choose numbers closer to the middle of the range to avoid extremes. This could lead to a lower average in subsequent rounds if players adjust their choices downward.",
        "232": "Observe Player Behavior: If you have access to the numbers chosen by all players in the previous round, look for outliers and consider whether those players are likely to adjust their strategy to be more in line with the group.",
        "233": "Adjust Your Strategy: Since your previous choice of 33.0 was higher than the winning number, consider choosing a lower number to be closer to 2/3 of the average if you expect the group behavior to remain consistent.",
        "234": "Consider Game Theory: Apply game theory principles to predict how rational players might alter their choices. If players are rational and aiming to win, they might iteratively lower their choices, aiming for a number that is 2/3 of the 2/3 average from the previous round.",
        "235": "Use Iterative Reasoning: Engage in higher-level iterative reasoning where you not only consider your own choice but also anticipate the reasoning of other players who are themselves trying to predict the choices of the group.",
        "236": "Efficiency: Making your decision within the time constraints of the game, ensuring that you have enough time to consider your options but not so much that you overthink your choice."
