After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Avoid Common Numbers: Since the goal is to be the closest to the target number, you should avoid choosing numbers that you believe will be popular among other players to reduce the chance of tying with someone else.\n - Maintain Flexibility: While you have a winning streak, avoid becoming predictable. Other players might start to predict your behavior and adjust their numbers accordingly. Introduce some variability in your choices to remain one step ahead.\n - Estimate the Next Average: Based on the rate of decrease, attempt to estimate the next average by observing the pattern of decrease from previous rounds.\n - Calculate 2/3 of the Estimated Average: Once you have an estimated average, calculate 2/3 of that number to determine your target number for the next round.\n - Analyze Trends: Look at the trend in the average numbers chosen. There is a clear downward trend in the numbers being selected. Players are likely to continue this trend, aiming lower each round as they attempt to guess what others will do.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

        "47": "Consider the Lower Bound: As the game progresses, the average is likely to approach a lower bound, as players realize that choosing numbers too high will not win. This lower bound might be somewhere above 0, as choosing 0 would drive the average down too much.",
        "48": "Calculate a Safe Range: Based on the previous averages and the slowing rate of decrease, you can estimate a range within which the new average might fall. For example, if the average is decreasing by smaller increments, you might predict the new average to be around 4.0 to 4.5.",
        "49": "Choose Your Number Strategically: Once you have estimated a safe range for the average, calculate 2/3 of the upper and lower bounds of this range to find a range for the target number. Your chosen number should be within this range but also consider the possibility of outliers affecting the average.",

        "52": "Avoid Round Numbers: Players may be inclined to choose round numbers (e.g., 5, 10, etc.), which can skew the average. You might want to avoid these and choose a number that is not a round number to get closer to the target.",
        "53": "Adapt to Win Patterns: You have won three times by choosing numbers that were higher than the target. In the rounds you lost, your chosen numbers were closer to the target. This might indicate that aiming a bit higher than the target could be a successful strategy, given the current player behavior.",
        "54": "Consider Game Theory: The game resembles a form of the \"beauty contest\" game, a common game theory problem. In such games, players must revise their strategies based on their understanding of others' levels of reasoning. Keep in mind that as players become more sophisticated, the numbers may start to stabilize or even increase again.",
        "55": "Maintain Flexibility: Be ready to adapt your strategy in case the trend does not continue as expected. Stay observant of the numbers chosen in the early part of the round if possible.",
        "56": "Avoid Extremes: Since the game seems to be converging, choosing numbers that are too high or too low could be risky. Aim for a number that reflects the convergence trend without being an outlier.",
        "57": "Reflect on Winning Numbers: The winning numbers so far have been higher than the target (25 when the target was 19.47, and 15 when the target was 12). This might indicate that players are not adjusting quickly enough to the 2/3 rule, so consider choosing a number slightly higher than 2/3 of your predicted average.",
        "58": "Monitor for Outliers: Be aware of the possibility of outliers\u2014players who might choose numbers far from the average, either due to misunderstanding the game or attempting to disrupt the pattern. This could affect the average and, consequently, the target number.",
        "59": "Analyze Trends: Look at the average numbers chosen in the previous rounds (29.2 and 18.0) and the corresponding winning numbers (25.0 and 15.0). Notice if there's a trend in how much lower the winning number is compared to the average.",
        "60": "Calculate Target Range: Given the previous rounds' data, calculate a range around the target number that has been successful. For instance, if the winning numbers were close to the target but not exactly 2/3, you might consider a range slightly above and below the exact 2/3 target.",
        "61": "Consider Player Behavior: If players are learning and adapting, they might choose lower numbers in subsequent rounds, anticipating that others will do the same. This could lead to a progressively lower average. Adjust your range accordingly.",
        "62": "Anticipate Further Reduction: Given the downward trend, it's reasonable to expect that the average number may continue to decrease as players adjust their strategies. You should consider selecting a number that accounts for this potential decrease.",
        "63": "Consider the Range of Reduction: Look at the amount by which the average has decreased in each round and use this to estimate a potential range for the next average. For example, if the average is decreasing by about 6-7 points each round, you might predict a similar decrease for the next round.",

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Consider the Game's Progression: As the game progresses, players are likely to choose even lower numbers, aiming closer to the target. This could lead to a further reduction in the average, but the change might be smaller than in the initial rounds.\n - Account for Player Behavior: Consider that players might change their strategies, especially if they notice the same patterns. Some might stick with a consistent strategy, while others might try to disrupt the pattern.\n - Aim for the Target: Remember that your goal is to be closest to 2/3 of the average. As the numbers get lower, the absolute difference between your number and the target becomes more critical. Fine-tune your guess to be as close as possible to the expected target.\n - Consider Game Dynamics: If players are consistently choosing lower numbers, the average will continue to decrease, but this cannot continue indefinitely as the numbers are bounded by 0. Anticipate the point at which players might stop lowering their numbers and stabilize around a certain range.\n - Play the Meta-Game: Consider the psychological aspect of the game. If you've been winning frequently, other players might adjust their strategies in response to yours. Use this to your advantage by anticipating their adjustments and countering them with your selection.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Look for Patterns: Examine the sequence of average numbers to see if there is a discernible pattern. For example, if the average is decreasing by a consistent amount, you can use this to estimate the next average.\n - Consider the Impact of Your Choice: Remember that your chosen number will also affect the average. If you are aiming to win, you might want to choose a number that influences the average in a way that benefits your prediction.\n - Consider Game Theory: In later rounds, players may be more strategic, and simple averaging may not be as effective. Consider game theory principles, such as the Nash equilibrium, to predict how rational players might behave.\n - Consider the Trend: The trend shows a decreasing average, which suggests players are becoming more conservative in their choices. If this trend continues, the next average could be even lower.\n - Use Weighted Averages: Give more weight to the more recent rounds when calculating your expected average, as they are more indicative of the current player strategies.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

The drop from Round 1 to Round 2 was significant (11.2 points), while the drop from Round 2 to Round 3 was smaller (5.4 points). This could suggest that the rate of decrease is slowing down. Use this information to fine-tune your estimate.",

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Refine Your Strategy: If players continue to be conservative, choosing a number slightly lower than the last average might be a good strategy. However, if you expect others to catch on to the downward trend, you might want to choose an even lower number to stay ahead of the curve.\n - Analyze Trends: Look at the trend of the averages and winning numbers. There is a clear downward trend in the numbers chosen, which suggests players are adjusting their choices based on the results of previous rounds.\n - Predictive Modeling: Use the trend to predict the next average. If players continue to follow the pattern of choosing numbers around the previous average, you can estimate the next average and calculate 2/3 of that to find your target number.\n - Adjust for Winning Strategy: Since you won rounds 6 and 7 by choosing a number equal to the previous average, consider whether other players might also use this strategy. If they do, the average might stabilize or decrease less sharply, so you may need to adjust your number down but not as aggressively.\n - Adjust Based on Player Behavior: If players are learning and adapting, they might be closer to the target in the next round. You should consider how quickly the other players are adjusting their strategies and whether they are likely to overshoot or undershoot the target.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

This suggests that players are not yet optimizing their choices perfectly. Use this information to gauge how conservative or aggressive players are being.",
        "1": "Refine Your Strategy: If players continue to be conservative, choosing a number slightly lower than the last average might be a good strategy. However, if you expect others to catch on to the downward trend, you might want to choose an even lower number to stay ahead of the curve.",

        "5": "Calculate Your Contribution: Decide on a number that, when factored into the average, will help steer the target number closer to your chosen number. If you expect the average to continue to decrease, you might choose a number slightly below the last round's average to contribute to the downward trend.",
        "6": "Consider the Range of Choices: Players have been choosing numbers progressively closer to the target. It might be beneficial to select a number that is not only influenced by the trend but also within a range that has been successful in previous rounds.",
        "7": "Use the Full Range: Remember that the range of numbers is 0 to 100. Even though the trend is downward, there is still a possibility that the average could bounce back up if players change their strategies. Be prepared for this possibility.",
        "8": "Be Mindful of Game Theory: If players are becoming more strategic, they might also be thinking about the game in terms of game theory and could adjust their choices to try to reach a Nash equilibrium. Be prepared for potential shifts in strategy that might disrupt the trend.",
        "9": "Psychological Factors: Consider the psychological impact of the previous rounds on player behavior. Some players might stick to a number that won in the past or avoid a number that lost.",
        "10": "Anticipate Continuation of the Trend: Given the consistent decrease in the average number, it is reasonable to anticipate that this trend may continue. Players may choose even lower numbers in the next round, so you should consider selecting a number that accounts for this possibility.",

        "12": "Consider the Rate of Decrease: Look at the rate at which the average is decreasing. If the rate of decrease is slowing down, the numbers might be stabilizing, and you should adjust your selection accordingly. If the rate is consistent or increasing, continue to adjust your number downward more aggressively.",
        "13": "Avoid Numbers Too Close to Previous Winning Numbers: Since the trend is downward, selecting a number that was a winning number in a previous round is likely to be too high for the next round. Aim lower than the most recent winning numbers.",

        "19": "Adjust for Winning Strategy: Since you won rounds 6 and 7 by choosing a number equal to the previous average, consider whether other players might also use this strategy. If they do, the average might stabilize or decrease less sharply, so you may need to adjust your number down but not as aggressively.",
        "20": "Observe Player Behavior: Keep an eye on how other players are adjusting their strategies. If they are not adapting and continue to choose numbers without considering the trend, you may have an advantage by sticking to a more analytical approach.",
        "21": "Fine-Tune Your Selection: Given that you won the last two rounds, you might not want to change your strategy drastically. However, fine-tuning your selection to account for slight variations in player behavior could improve your chances of winning.",
        "22": "Be Prepared for Shifts: Stay alert for any shifts in the pattern. If there is a sudden change in the average number chosen, be ready to adapt your strategy accordingly.",
        "23": "Maintain Flexibility: While it's beneficial to have a strategy based on the observed trends, it's also important to remain flexible and not adhere too rigidly to a pattern in case the dynamics of player choices change.",
        "24": "Stay Dynamic: Be ready to adjust your strategy in subsequent rounds based on the new information each round provides. The game is dynamic, and sticking rigidly to a single strategy may not be optimal.",
        "25": "Estimate the Next Average: If the trend continues, you might expect the average to decrease further. However, the rate of decrease may slow down as players approach the equilibrium. You could estimate the next average by considering the rate of decrease and adjusting for the possibility of players slowing their descent toward lower numbers.",
        "26": "Calculate the Rate of Convergence: Determine how quickly the average is converging towards the theoretical equilibrium of 0. This can help you predict future averages and thus the target number more accurately.",
        "27": "Predict Player Behavior: If players are rational and learning from past rounds, they might start choosing numbers closer to the theoretical equilibrium. However, if they are influenced by recent outcomes, they might still choose numbers based on the most recent winning numbers.",
        "28": "Be Adaptive: Be ready to adapt your strategy if you notice a sudden change in the other players' behavior. If the average jumps up or down significantly, you will need to adjust your prediction accordingly.",
        "29": "Choose Below the Winning Number: Since the winning numbers have been consistently above the target, you might aim to choose a number that is slightly below the last winning number, assuming the trend of decreasing averages continues.",
        "30": "Avoid Extremes: Since the game is converging, choosing a number that is too low or too high could be risky. Aim for a number that reflects the convergence trend without being an outlier.",
        "31": "Avoid Outliers: If you have been choosing numbers that are outliers compared to the rest of the group, consider moving closer to the anticipated group average to increase your chances of being near the target number.",
        "32": "Consider Game Theory: If players are rational and have noticed the trend towards the equilibrium of 0, they might start choosing lower numbers more aggressively. Be prepared for a potential larger drop in the average if players collectively move towards the equilibrium strategy.",
        "33": "Adjust Your Estimate Downward: Since your previous choices were higher than the winning numbers, and the overall trend is decreasing, you should consider selecting a lower number closer to the last winning number or even below it, anticipating that the average may continue to decrease.",
        "34": "Consider the Range of Winning Numbers: The winning numbers so far have been 25.0 and 15.0. Use these as a reference point for what players might be thinking. It's possible that players will anchor around these numbers or adjust based on them.",
        "35": "Be Conservative, But Not Too Much: Since the game is converging towards lower numbers, being too aggressive with high numbers could put you at a disadvantage. However, choosing a number that's too low could also be risky if the average doesn't decrease as much as you anticipate.",
        "36": "Avoid Extremes: Given the unpredictability of human behavior, selecting a number at the extreme ends (very high or very low) could be risky. Aim for a moderate choice that accounts for potential variability in the other players' selections.",

        "38": "Extrapolate the Decline: Analyze the rate of decline in the average numbers chosen to predict the likely average for the next round. This can be done by looking at the difference between the averages of consecutive rounds and estimating if the decline is slowing down or remaining consistent.",
        "39": "Adjust Your Number: Based on the extrapolated average, calculate 2/3 of that value to determine your next chosen number. If the decline is slowing, you may want to choose a slightly higher number than the strict 2/3 calculation to account for the slower rate of decline.",
        "40": "Consider Game Theory: If the game continues for many more rounds, the average should theoretically continue to decline. However, since the game has only 20 rounds, players may not adjust their strategies as they would in an infinitely repeated game. Keep in mind the limited number of rounds when predicting behavior.",
        "41": "Calculate the Target Number: If the next average is indeed around 2.9, then the target number would be 2/3 of that, which is approximately 1.93. This is the number you should aim to get close to.",
        "42": "Consider the Pattern of Convergence: The numbers are converging towards zero, but the rate of convergence is slowing down. It's unlikely that the average will continue to halve indefinitely since players are likely to adjust their strategies as they notice the trend.",
        "43": "Monitor the Range of Choices: Keep an eye on the range within which most numbers fall. If the range is narrowing, it might be safer to choose a number within this narrowing band.",
        "44": "Avoid Anchoring to Specific Numbers: While you've been successful with certain numbers before, avoid becoming anchored to them as the game dynamics are constantly changing.",
        "45": "Use Statistical Analysis: If possible, calculate the mean and standard deviation of the previous winning numbers to inform your choice.",
        "46": "Prepare for Endgame Strategy: As the game progresses, players may change their strategies significantly. Be ready to adjust your predictions based on not just the mathematical trend but also the psychological and strategic shifts that may occur as the end of the game approaches.",
        "47": "Choose Your Number: Based on the predicted target, choose a number that you believe will be closest to this value. Since the winning number has been consistently higher than the exact target, you might want to choose a number slightly above the predicted target, but still close to it.",
        "48": "Adjust for Player Behavior: Consider that as the game progresses, players may become more strategic or change their behavior. Be prepared to adjust your predictions and chosen number accordingly.",
        "49": "Monitor the Results: After the next round, compare the actual average and target with your predictions to refine your analysis for subsequent rounds.",
        "50": "Consider Game Theory: In a game like this, players are likely to converge towards a Nash equilibrium over time. If players are rational and have perfect information, the equilibrium would be 0. However, since players are learning and adapting, the convergence may not be perfect. Adjust your strategy to account for this.",
        "51": "Avoid Anchoring to Round Numbers: Players may have a bias towards choosing round numbers (like 5 or 10). By choosing numbers that are not round, you might get closer to the 2/3 target.",
        "52": "Consider the Winning Numbers: Look at the numbers that have won in the past rounds. Are they consistently above or below the target? This might indicate a bias in player choices that you can exploit.",
        "53": "Be Prepared to Tie: As the game progresses and players' strategies converge, the likelihood of ties increases. Be mentally prepared for this outcome.",
        "54": "Stay Flexible: Be ready to adapt your strategy if the results of the next round do not match your predictions.",
        "55": "Use the 2/3 Rule Proactively: Instead of choosing a number and then applying the 2/3 rule, start by considering what the target number might be and then work backward to determine what the average would need to be for your number to be 2/3 of that average.",
        "56": "Reflect on Psychological Factors: Consider the psychological impact of the game on you and other players. As the game progresses, players may become more conservative or take more risks. Try to gauge the mood and adjust your strategy accordingly.",
        "57": "Adjust Your Estimation: Given that you have been overestimating, aim to choose a lower number in the next round to compensate for the bias. Consider how the average has been decreasing and try to predict if this trend will continue.",
        "58": "Calculate the 2/3 Value: Before making your selection, explicitly calculate 2/3 of your estimated average to ensure you are aiming for the correct target number.",
        "59": "Observe Others' Behavior: If possible, look for patterns in the numbers chosen by other players. Are there any consistent over- or under-estimators? This information can help you refine your prediction of the average.",
        "60": "Aim for the Middle Ground: If you are unsure about the exact number to choose, consider selecting a number that is not at the extreme ends of the range. This can be a safer bet if the average fluctuates unpredictably.",
        "61": "Avoid Fixed Patterns: Be careful not to follow a predictable pattern that other players might exploit. Adapt to the game without being too predictable.",
        "62": "Diversify Your Choices: Consider choosing a lower number if you have been consistently choosing numbers above the winning number. Avoid being an outlier unless you strongly believe the average will continue to decrease significantly.",
        "63": "Observe Others: Take note of the numbers chosen by other players in previous rounds. Learn from their approach without directly copying it.",
        "64": "Stay Rational: Each round is independent. Do not let emotions from previous losses affect your decision-making process. Stay focused on the current round's decision.",
        "65": "Be Prepared for Change: Players may change their strategies at any time. Be ready to adapt if there is a sudden shift in the numbers chosen.",
        "66": "Use a Range: Consider a range of numbers that could potentially be close to the target. This can help you be more flexible in your choice.",
        "67": "Consider the Range of Decrease: Look at the range between the averages of each round (e.g., 29.2 to 18.0 is a decrease of 11.2, and 18.0 to 12.6 is a decrease of 5.4). Use this to gauge how much the average might decrease in the next round.",
        "68": "Calculate the Average Deviation: Determine the average deviation of the winning numbers from the 2/3 target over the past rounds. Use this average deviation as a factor to adjust your next choice.",
        "69": "Consider the Direction of Change: Notice that the average chosen number has been decreasing over the rounds. If this trend continues, you might anticipate a further decrease and adjust your number down slightly.",
        "70": "Use a Weighted Approach: Give more weight to the more recent rounds when considering how much to adjust your number, as players may be adapting their strategies over time.",
        "71": "Monitor Your Position: You've won the last two rounds by choosing the exact target number. Other players might notice this and adjust their strategies. Be mindful of potential changes in their choices as a response to your wins.",
        "72": "Avoid Anchoring to Your Previous Choices: Just because you chose a certain number in the past does not mean it is the right choice for the next round. Make sure your selection is based on the current analysis, not on past choices.",

        "74": "Adjust Based on Player Behavior: If players are learning and adapting, they might be closer to the target in the next round. You should consider how quickly the other players are adjusting their strategies and whether they are likely to overshoot or undershoot the target.",
        "75": "Choose a Conservative Number: Given the uncertainty and the trend of decreasing averages, a conservative approach might be to choose a number slightly below your calculated target, but not too far from it to remain competitive.",
        "76": "Consider Player Behavior: Players may not all converge to the equilibrium at the same rate. Some may over-adjust, while others may under-adjust. Consider the possibility of outliers and how they might affect the average.",
        "77": "Choose a Strategic Number: Based on your estimate of the new average and the target, select a number that is slightly lower than what you believe will be the new target. If you expect the target to be around 6.67, you might choose a number like 5 or 6 to account for the variability in other players' choices.",
        "78": "Avoid Anchoring: Don't anchor your choice too closely to previous rounds' averages or winning numbers. Instead, focus on the trend and how players are likely to adjust their strategies.",
        "79": "Calculate Your Number: Once you have an estimated new average, calculate 2/3 of that number to determine your selection. For example, if you predict an average of 15.0, then 2/3 of that is 10.0. You might choose a number close to 10.0, but consider point 4 below.",
        "80": "Consider Overcorrection: Players might overcorrect based on the previous round's results, leading to a lower-than-expected average. You may want to choose a number slightly higher than the strict 2/3 calculation to account for this possibility.",
        "81": "Incremental Adjustment: Consider adjusting your number incrementally rather than making a large jump. This can help you stay closer to the target as you refine your predictions with each round.",
        "82": "Reflect on Your Own Impact: Remember that your choice also affects the average. If you choose a number significantly lower or higher than your estimated average, you could skew the results. Aim for consistency in your strategy.",
        "83": "Prepare for Randomness: There is an element of randomness in the choices of others, which can affect the outcome. Be prepared for unexpected shifts in the average and adapt your strategy accordingly in subsequent rounds.",
        "84": "Analyze Trends: Look at the trend in the average numbers chosen in the past three rounds. There is a clear downward trend (29.2, 18.0, 12.6). Consider if this trend is likely to continue or if there will be a regression toward a higher average.",
        "85": "Adjust Expectations: Given the trend, adjust your expectations for what the other players might choose. If the trend continues, expect a lower average again, but be prepared for the possibility of a bounce back to a higher average.",
        "86": "Calculate Conservatively: Since the winning numbers have been consistently higher than the target number, consider choosing a number slightly higher than 2/3 of your predicted average to account for this pattern.",
        "87": "Consider Overcompensation: Given the trend, players might start to overcompensate by choosing even lower numbers, expecting others to do the same. Be mindful of this potential overcorrection when making your selection.",

        "89": "Reflect on Your Own Choices: You have been choosing numbers that are relatively close to the average. Consider if you need to adjust more aggressively to account for the trend.",
        "90": "Consider Game Theory: Remember that if all players are rational and aiming for the target number, the theoretically correct choice is 0. However, since this is not happening, factor in the level of rationality you expect from your opponents.",
        "91": "Calculate Target Range: Given the trend, estimate a range where the new target number might fall. If the average continues to decrease, the target number will also be lower. Use the previous averages to predict a possible range for the next target.",
        "92": "Consider Player Behavior: Recognize that other players are also adapting. If they are rational, they might also lower their numbers. You may need to choose a number that is not only lower than your previous choices but also anticipates the adjustments of others.",
        "93": "Use the Iterative Elimination Process: If players are becoming more rational and strategic, they might iteratively eliminate higher numbers. Consider choosing a number that is 2/3 of the last round's target number, as a starting point for your decision.",
        "94": "Observe the Extremes: Take note of the highest and lowest numbers from the previous rounds. Some players may stick to these extremes or avoid them, which can affect the average. Decide whether to position your choice relative to these extremes.",
        "95": "Implement a Proportional Response: Instead of choosing a fixed number, consider a proportional response based on the change in the average from the last round. If the average is decreasing, choose a number that is proportionally lower than your last choice.",
        "96": "Prepare for Convergence: As the game progresses, players may converge towards a particular strategy. Be ready to identify this convergence and adjust your number accordingly to stay competitive.",
        "97": "Stay Unpredictable: While adapting to the trend, ensure that your number is not easily predictable by others, as they might also be trying to anticipate your move to adjust their own.",
        "98": "Set a Range: Based on the previous averages and the trend, set a range within which you believe the next average will fall. Then calculate 2/3 of the midpoint of that range for your next choice.",
        "99": "Look for Patterns: If you have data from more than one round, look for any patterns in the numbers chosen by individual players. Are there players who consistently choose high or low numbers? Are there any trends in how much players adjust their numbers from one round to the next?",
        "100": "Estimate Conservatism: If players are conservative and adjust their numbers down only slightly, you might want to choose a number that is slightly less than 2/3 of the previous average. If players are more aggressive in their adjustments, you might want to choose an even lower number.",
        "101": "Estimate Convergence Rate: Determine the rate at which players are converging towards the lower numbers. If the average is dropping quickly, you might predict a further decrease and choose a number that is lower than your previous choice but still above the expected new average.",
        "102": "Consider Player Behavior: Not all players may be rational or aware of the game-theoretic equilibrium. Some might stick to arbitrary numbers or have their own unique strategies. Factor in some variability in player choices.",

        "110": "Estimate Adjustments: Try to estimate how much other players might adjust their numbers based on the results of Round 1. If players are rational, they might lower their numbers, so you should account for this in your selection.",
        "111": "Consider Convergence: If players are adjusting their numbers downwards, the game could converge towards the theoretical equilibrium over several rounds. You might want to anticipate this convergence and choose a number that is not only lower than your previous choice but also anticipates further downward adjustments by others.",
        "112": "Set a Range: Instead of picking a single number, consider a range of numbers that could potentially be close to the target. This range should be based on the expected adjustments of other players and the convergence trend.",
        "113": "Play Conservatively: If you are unsure about the extent to which other players will adjust their numbers, it might be safer to make a moderate adjustment to your own number rather than a drastic one.",
        "114": "Analyze the Previous Outcome: The average number chosen in the last round was 29.2, and the target was 19.47. Your choice was 33.0, which was higher than the average and much higher than the target. This suggests that you may need to adjust your prediction downwards.",
        "115": "Calculate a New Baseline: Given the previous average of 29.2, consider what would have been a winning strategy. The winning number was 25.0, which suggests that players are not yet converging to the theoretical equilibrium of 0. Use this information to inform your next choice.",

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Predict Others' Behavior: If you can predict a shift in the other players' strategies, you can adjust your number accordingly. For example, if you believe others will choose higher numbers to counter the trend, you might want to select a number that is slightly higher than the last winning number.\n - Prepare for Equilibrium: If the game is approaching an equilibrium, the numbers might start to cluster around a certain range. Try to identify this range and choose a number within it that you believe will be closest to the new target.\n - Analyze the Rate of Decrease: Look at the difference in the average number chosen from round to round. The average is decreasing, but is it doing so at a consistent rate? If the rate of decrease is slowing down, it might suggest that players are approaching a stable strategy.\n - Winning Number Analysis: Analyze the winning numbers and see if there is a pattern in how much they are above the target number. This could help you fine-tune your guess.\n - Use the Winning Number as a Guide: The winning number has been closer to the target number than the average, so consider choosing a number that is slightly above the target number for the next round, assuming the trend continues.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

        "35": "Calculate a Safe Range: Look at the difference between the average numbers and the winning numbers in previous rounds. Use this information to establish a range of numbers that could potentially be winning numbers.

        "42": "Adjust Your Baseline: Given that your previous choices have been consistently higher than the winning number, consider lowering your baseline choice. If the average continues to decrease, you don't want to adjust too drastically, but a moderate decrease in your chosen number could be warranted.",

        "45": "Prepare for Variability: While the trend has been decreasing, there is always a chance for variability. Be prepared to adjust your strategy in subsequent rounds based on new information.",
        "46": "Consider the Rate of Decrease: The average chosen number has been decreasing each round. Try to estimate the rate of this decrease to better predict the next average and thus the next target number.",
        "47": "Observe Player Behavior: If possible, take note of how other players might be changing their strategies. Are they consistently choosing lower numbers each round? Are they making drastic changes or small adjustments?",
        "48": "Apply Game Theory: Recognize that other players are also observing these patterns and may adjust their strategies accordingly. Anticipate that others might choose lower numbers and factor this into your decision.",
        "49": "Adjust for Player Behavior: Players seem to be learning and adjusting their guesses closer to the target number each round. Expect this trend to continue, which means the winning number may be closer to the actual target number in the next round than in previous rounds.",
        "50": "Use the Offset Strategy: In Round 2, you won by choosing a number that was 3 units above the target. However, as the game progresses and players adjust, the winning offset might decrease. You may want to choose a number slightly closer to your predicted target than before.",
        "51": "Predict the Next Target: Based on the last average of 6.2, if we assume a similar rate of decrease, the next average might be around 5 or lower. Two-thirds of that would be approximately 3.33. You might consider choosing a number slightly above this if you're applying an offset strategy.",
        "52": "Stay Flexible: While using the winning number as a reference can be helpful, it's important to remain flexible and responsive to the changing dynamics of the game. If you notice a shift in player behavior, be ready to adjust your strategy accordingly.",
        "53": "Account for Variability: While the trend is downward, there is still variability in the numbers chosen by other players. Be prepared for the possibility that the average might not decrease as much as in previous rounds, or it could even increase slightly.",
        "54": "Consider Game Theory: Players may be thinking similarly about the downward trend and might adjust their numbers even lower. You may want to choose a number that accounts for this potential overcorrection by others.",
        "55": "Reflect on Your Own Choices: You have consistently chosen numbers that are slightly higher than the winning number. Consider adjusting your choice downward more aggressively to align with the trend.",
        "56": "Stay Within the Middle Ground: To avoid extremes, aim for a number that falls within the middle of the expected range based on the trend. This helps you stay competitive without taking on too much risk.",
        "57": "Consider Psychological Factors: Players may gravitate towards certain numbers due to psychological biases (like choosing round numbers). Try to account for these biases in your predictions.",
        "58": "Reflect on Your Own Choices: You won Round 2 with a number that was close to the average of Round 1. Consider if there is a lag in how players adjust their numbers based on previous rounds.",
        "59": "Balance Risk and Reward: Consider the risk-reward trade-off of your chosen number. Choosing a number very close to the last target might yield a win if others over-adjust, but it could also place you far from the target if the trend continues.",
        "60": "Engage in Psychological Analysis: If possible, try to understand the thought process of other players. Are they likely to continue the trend, or might they anticipate a reversal? Your choice should reflect your best guess of the collective mindset.",
        "61": "Analyze Your Own Performance: You won Round 2 by choosing 15.0, which was the exact target number. However, given the trend of players adjusting their numbers, you may need to consider choosing a slightly lower number if you expect the average to continue to decrease.",
        "62": "Predict the Next Average: If players continue to adjust their numbers downward, you might expect the average to decrease further. However, it's also possible that some players might anticipate this and choose higher numbers to counteract the trend. You'll need to balance these possibilities when making your choice.",
        "63": "Consider Player Behavior: Players may anticipate the trend and adjust their numbers upwards to counteract it. Be mindful of this potential adjustment when choosing your number.",
        "64": "Calculate the Target Range: If the average continues to decrease, expect it to be within the 10 to 15 range. Calculate 2/3 of this range to get a target range of approximately 6.67 to 10.",
        "65": "Choose Within the Adjusted Range: Based on the calculated target range, select a number that falls within this range but also consider the possibility of outliers that may shift the average.",
        "66": "Use Historical Data: You won in round 2 with a number that was 3 units above the target. In rounds 3 and 4, the winning numbers were also above the target. This might indicate a pattern where the winning number tends to be slightly higher than the 2/3 target.",
        "67": "Refine Your Strategy: If the trend reverses and the average increases, be prepared to adjust your number upwards. Keep an eye on the behavior of other players to gauge whether such a reversal is likely.",
        "68": "Use a Weighted Approach: Instead of choosing a number based solely on the last round's average, consider a weighted approach that takes into account the averages and winning numbers from all previous rounds.",
        "69": "Select a Strategic Number: Choose a number that is slightly higher than 2/3 of your predicted average, but within the range of winning numbers from previous rounds. This balances the observed pattern with the decreasing trend.",
        "70": "Use a Safety Margin: To avoid being too far off, you can choose a number with a safety margin. For example, if you estimate the 2/3 target to be around 10, you might choose a number like 11 or 12 to give yourself some leeway.",
        "71": "Observe Round-to-Round Changes: The change from Round 1 to Round 2 was significant. If players are over-correcting, the next round might see a smaller change or a slight increase in the average number chosen.",
        "72": "Consider Game Theory: Consider how far from the equilibrium players might deviate, as all players might converge towards a Nash equilibrium where everyone chooses the same number, which would be the target number.",
        "73": "Be Adaptive: Be prepared to adapt your strategy based on the numbers chosen in the upcoming round. If the average shifts again, you'll need to be flexible and adjust your number choice accordingly.",
        "74": "Adjust Based on Previous Round: Since the average number chosen in Round 1 was 29.2, and your choice was 30.0, which was higher than the target number of 19.47, consider choosing a lower number in the next round to be closer to 2/3 of the average.",
        "75": "Consider Game Dynamics: Recognize that as the game progresses, players are learning and adapting. The numbers may stabilize as players converge on a strategy that they feel is optimal. Be prepared to adjust if you notice a new pattern emerging.",
        "76": "Strategic Conservatism: If you believe other players will continue to lower their numbers, you might want to choose a number that is conservatively lower than your last choice but not as low as you would expect the new average to be. This could position you close to the target if others over-adjust.",
        "77": "Balance Between Conformity and Innovation: While it's important to conform to the trend to some extent, being innovative with your number choice could give you an edge. If you notice everyone is consistently lowering their numbers, choosing a number slightly higher than the expected trend might pay off.",
        "78": "Expect Rational Behavior: Assume that other players are rational and aiming for the target number. This means that drastic changes in the average are less likely as the game progresses and players hone in on the optimal strategy.",
        "79": "Communication and Collaboration: If the game rules allow for communication between players, consider forming alliances or sharing strategies to influence the average number chosen. This can be a risky move but might lead to a more predictable outcome.",
        "80": "Estimate New Average: Based on the adjustments you expect others to make, try to estimate a new average for the upcoming round. Use this estimated average to calculate 2/3 of that value, which will be your target.",
        "81": "Choose a Conservatively Lower Number: Given that the winning number in the previous round was still higher than the target, it might be safe to assume that not all players will adjust optimally. Choosing a number that is conservatively lower than your previous choice could position you closer to the new target.",
        "82": "Observe Player Behavior: If you have information on how individual players have changed their numbers in the past, use this to inform your prediction. Some players may consistently choose higher or lower numbers, while others may be more erratic.",
        "83": "Incorporate Round Dynamics: As the game progresses, players may become more conservative or take more risks. Consider how the dynamics of the game might change as players become more desperate to win or more strategic in their choices.",
        "84": "Estimate the New Average: Given the trend, you might predict a slight increase in the average number chosen in the next round. If the average was 12.6 in Round 3, players might choose numbers that could bring the average up to around 15-20.",
        "85": "Calculate Your Number: If you estimate the new average to be, for example, 17, then 2/3 of that would be approximately 11.33. Since you expect some overcorrection, you might want to choose a number slightly higher than this, perhaps in the range of 12-14.",
        "86": "Consider Psychological Factors: Players may be influenced by the most recent round more than earlier rounds. Given that the last winning number was 12, players might anchor around this number and adjust their choices accordingly.",
        "87": "Use Probabilistic Thinking: There is uncertainty in predicting other players' choices. Consider the probability distribution of numbers chosen in previous rounds and use this to inform your decision.",
        "88": "Stay Within Range: Given the previous results, aim for a number that is safely within the range of the winning numbers but still close to 2/3 of the average. This might mean choosing a number slightly lower than what you think the average will be.",
        "89": "Stay Consistent: While it's important to adapt, don't make drastic changes based on a single round's outcome. Look for consistent patterns over several rounds before making significant strategy shifts.",
        "90": "Anticipate Convergence: As players adjust their strategies, the numbers may start to converge around a certain point. Expect the average to potentially stabilize as players learn from previous rounds.",
        "91": "Adjust Your Guess: Given the trend, you might consider choosing a number slightly lower than your last guess but not too low, as other players might also be adjusting downwards.",
        "92": "Use the Full Range: Players may not be fully utilizing the 0-100 range. Don't be afraid to choose numbers that are outside of the range that has been winning if it aligns with the 2/3 target.",
        "93": "Stay Flexible: Be ready to adapt your strategy if the trend changes. If you notice a sudden increase in the average number chosen, be prepared to adjust your guess accordingly.",
        "94": "Learn from Success: You won Round 2 by choosing 15 when the average was 18. This suggests that a conservative approach, aiming not too far from the target, can be successful.",
        "95": "Avoid Anchoring: Don't anchor your guess too closely to previous averages or winning numbers. Consider them, but base your decision on the 2/3 target.",
        "96": "Analyze the Gap: Look at the difference between your chosen number (30.0) and the target number (19.47) from the previous round. The gap indicates that your guess was higher than necessary. You should consider choosing a lower number in the next round to be closer to the target.",
        "97": "Understand Player Behavior: If the average number chosen in the first round was 29.2, it suggests that players are not yet converging towards the theoretical equilibrium (which would be 0 if all players are fully rational and iteratively applying the 2/3 rule). Players might still be in the process of adjusting their strategies. Keep this in mind when choosing your next number.",
        "98": "Consider Game Dynamics: Since this is a repeated game, players will likely adjust their numbers based on the previous round's average. Expect the average to decrease as players adapt. You should adjust your number choice accordingly, but not so drastically that you overshoot the target if others are slow to adapt.",
        "99": "Avoid Knee-Jerk Reactions: Given that you won the second round, there might be a temptation to stick with the same number or make a drastic change based on the results of just two rounds. Instead, consider making a moderate adjustment to account for the variability in other players' choices.",
        "100": "Consider the Winning Range: The winning numbers were 25.0 and 15.0, respectively. This suggests that the group is converging around a certain range. Aim for a number that falls within or close to this winning range, adjusted for the 2/3 target.",
        "101": "Choose a Moderately Lower Number: If you believe the trend towards lower numbers will continue, you might choose a number slightly lower than your last winning number (15.0), but not so low that it would be a radical departure from the previous winning range.",
        "102": "Account for Strategy Shifts: Be prepared for the possibility that other players might adjust their strategies, especially if they are analyzing the same trends. This could mean that the average might not drop as much as in the previous round, or it might even increase.",
        "103": "Set a Target Range: Instead of fixating on a single number, consider a range of numbers that could potentially be close to the 2/3 target. This gives you some leeway and accounts for the unpredictability of other players' choices.",
        "104": "Observe Winning Number: The winning number was 25.0, which is still above the target number. This suggests that other players are also not choosing optimally. Aim for a number that is closer to the target than the winning number, but consider that others might be doing the same.",
        "105": "Analyze Trends: Look at the change in the average number chosen from Round 1 to Round 2. There was a significant reduction in the average number chosen (from 29.2 to 18.0). Determine if this trend is likely to continue or stabilize.",
        "106": "Estimate Reduction Percentage: Calculate the percentage reduction in the average number chosen between the two rounds. Use this percentage to estimate a potential new average for the upcoming round, assuming players continue to adjust their numbers downward.",
        "107": "Consider Game Theory: Recognize that as players learn from previous rounds, they may adjust their strategies. In a game where players are rational and aiming to converge on the equilibrium, the numbers may continue to decrease until they stabilize around the theoretical equilibrium point.",
        "108": "Calculate Potential Target Number: Based on the estimated new average, calculate 2/3 of that number to find a potential target number for the next round. This will be your preliminary guess before considering other factors.",
        "109": "Adjust for Player Behavior: Consider that not all players may be rational or may not adjust their numbers optimally. Some may stick to certain numbers out of superstition or habit, while others may try to outguess the competition by choosing numbers that are not strictly rational.",
        "110": "Refine Your Model: Use the results of the previous rounds to refine your predictive model. If you won the last round, consider how your winning number might influence the choices of other players. They might expect you to choose a similar number again or believe you will adjust your strategy.",
        "111": "Prepare for Variability: Be ready for variability in the choices of other players, especially as the game progresses and players become more unpredictable. Have a range of numbers in mind that you would consider choosing, rather than fixating on a single number.",
        "112": "Monitor Round-to-Round Changes: Keep an eye on how much the average number changes from round to round. If the changes are becoming smaller, it may indicate that players are converging on an equilibrium. If the changes are still large, expect more variability.",
        "113": "Risk Assessment: Determine how aggressive or conservative you want to be with your number choice. If you believe other players will significantly lower their numbers, you might choose a more conservative number closer to the target. If you think others will not adjust much, a slightly more aggressive number might be warranted.",
        "114": "Learning Curve: Recognize that there is a learning curve for all players. As the game progresses, the average number is likely to get closer to the theoretical equilibrium. Your adjustments should reflect an expectation of collective learning.",
        "115": "Collaboration and Competition Analysis: Analyze the level of competition and potential collaboration among players. Understand the dynamics of the other players to inform your strategy.",
        "116": "Adjust Your Estimate: Based on the winning number from the previous round, consider adjusting your estimate downward for the upcoming round. Anticipate that other players might continue choosing higher numbers than the optimal strategy would suggest.",
        "117": "Consider Game Theory: Take into account the principles of game theory and the potential rationality of other players. Be prepared for the possibility that the average number chosen by players may decrease as they aim closer to the true target of 2/3 of the average.",
        "118": "Observe Player Behavior: If possible, observe the numbers chosen by all players and look for outliers or consistent patterns in their choices. Use this information to predict future averages and adjust your strategy.",
        "119": "Refine Your Strategy: Refine your strategy by choosing a number somewhat lower than your previous choice, considering the observed player behavior and the potential shift in the average number chosen by players.",
        "120": "Consider the Influence of Your Choice: Recognize that your choice contributes to the average number. Consider how your selection can influence the average and potentially bring the target number closer to your chosen number.",
        "121": "Learn from Others: If the game allows for observation of other players' choices or if there are discernible patterns in their selections, use this information to inform and adapt your strategy for the upcoming rounds.",
        "122": "Set a Range for Your Choice: To manage risk, decide on a range of numbers that you believe will be safe based on the previous average and target. For example, if you expect the average to decrease slightly, you might set a range that is somewhat lower than the previous average.",
        "123": "Use a Proportional Strategy: Consider choosing a number that is a certain proportion of the previous average, factoring in the target of 2/3. For instance, if you expect players to adjust their choices downward, you might choose a number that is 2/3 of the previous average or slightly less to account for this adjustment.",
        "124": "Avoid Extremes: To not be the furthest from the target, avoid choosing numbers at the extremes (very high or very low). This reduces the risk of being an outlier.",
        "125": "Observe Trends: If you notice a trend in the numbers chosen (e.g., they are consistently decreasing), factor this into your decision-making process for the next round.",
        "126": "Balance Conservatism and Aggression: Be conservative enough to avoid being the furthest from the target, but be aggressive enough to have a chance at winning. This might mean choosing a number that is moderately below the previous average.",
        "127": "Predict Behavioral Adjustments: Assume that other players will notice that the winning number was still higher than the target and adjust their choices downward. You should anticipate this collective adjustment.",
        "128": "Understand Player Behavior: Recognize that players may not be fully rational or may not have a perfect understanding of the game's equilibrium. In a fully rational setting, the game should converge to everyone choosing zero, but this is not happening. Use this understanding to inform your choice.",
        "129": "Adjust Expectations: Since you won Round 2 by choosing 15, which was the winning number, and it was close to the target number (12), you can infer that other players might also gravitate towards numbers in this range. However, be cautious, as players may now adjust downwards, anticipating similar behavior from others.",
        "130": "Consider Game Theory: If players are learning and adapting, they might be using iterative elimination of dominated strategies. This means they will avoid numbers that have been proven suboptimal in previous rounds. You should do the same.",
        "131": "Refine Your Strategy: Given that the average decreased from Round 1 to Round 2, you might want to choose a number slightly lower than your last winning number (15) to account for the possibility of the average continuing to decrease.",
        "132": "Balance Risk and Reward: Since the game is played over multiple rounds, you don't need to win every round to be successful overall. It might be beneficial to take a calculated risk with your number choice to learn more about other players' strategies.",
        "133": "Maintain a Record: Keep a detailed record of each round's average and winning numbers. This data will help you identify patterns and make more informed decisions in future rounds.",
        "134": "Avoid Extremes: Don't choose numbers at the extreme ends (0 or 100) as these are unlikely to be close to 2/3 of the average. Aim for a balanced choice that accounts for the expected downward adjustment.",
        "135": "Monitor Trends: Keep an eye on the trend over multiple rounds. If the average is consistently decreasing, factor this into your strategy. If it's fluctuating, consider a more conservative approach.",
        "136": "Be Adaptive: Be ready to change your strategy if you notice a shift in the other players' behavior that deviates from your predictions.",
        "137": "Consider the Range: The winning numbers have been above the target number in all rounds. This suggests that players, on average, are not choosing low enough numbers to hit the target. You might want to choose a number slightly above the target to account for this trend.",
        "138": "Use the 2/3 Rule: Since the target number is 2/3 of the average, you can use this rule to guide your choice. If you expect the average to continue decreasing, choose a number that, when multiplied by the number of players (10) and added to the sum of your expected numbers from other players, would result in an average that is 3/2 of your chosen number.",
        "139": "Reflect on Player Behavior: Consider how players might react to the previous rounds. After a win in Round 2, players might have overcorrected in Round 3, leading to a lower average. They might correct again, leading to a slightly higher average in the next round.",
        "140": "Stay Near the Middle: Given the uncertainty of other players' choices, it might be wise to choose a number that is not at the extremes. This could help you stay close to the target as others adjust their strategies.",
        "141": "Monitor the Winning Gap: Observe the gap between the winning number and the target number. If this gap is narrowing, it suggests players are getting better at estimating the target. If it's widening, players might be struggling to adapt, and you can use this to your advantage.",
        "142": "Learn from Your Wins and Losses: You won with 15 and lost with 14, but the averages were different. Consider what this says about the direction players are moving and adjust your next choice accordingly, but not too drastically.",
        "143": "Stay Flexible: While you want to optimize incrementally, be ready to adapt if there is a sudden and clear shift in the other players' strategies that would require a more significant change in your approach.",
        "144": "Resource Optimization: Optimize your number choice to increase the likelihood of being closest to the target number without wasting opportunities to learn from previous rounds.",
        "145": "Learning and Improvement: Learn from each round to refine your strategy. Analyze the outcomes and adjust your approach to improve your chances of winning in subsequent rounds."
