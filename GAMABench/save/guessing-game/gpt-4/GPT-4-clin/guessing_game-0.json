After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nLearnings:\n-1. Observing past winning numbers MAY CONTRIBUTE to predicting future target numbers.\n2. Considering the choices of other players MAY BE NECESSARY to estimate the average accurately.\n3. Adjusting your chosen number based on the trends of previous rounds MAY CONTRIBUTE to getting closer to the target number.\n4. Analyzing the variance in chosen numbers SHOULD BE NECESSARY to understand the range of numbers that could win.\n5. Remembering that players may change their strategies DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to assuming the same numbers will win each round.\n6. Calculating the potential target number before choosing MAY BE NECESSARY to make an informed decision.\n7. Being aware of psychological factors, such as players avoiding extreme numbers, MAY CONTRIBUTE to anticipating the average.\n8. Recognizing that the target number is always 2/3 of the average SHOULD BE NECESSARY to formulate a strategy.\n9. Considering the possibility of ties MAY BE NECESSARY to prepare for shared victories or losses.\n10. Realizing that your own choice affects the average and target number SHOULD BE NECESSARY to strategize effectively.\nLearnings:\n-Reflecting on the historical data and the learnings provided, here is a revised list of strategic points that could be beneficial for future game rounds:\n\n1.

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nLearnings:\n-1. Analyzing the chosen numbers of other players MAY BE NECESSARY to predict future behavior and refine your own choice.\n2. Considering the psychological aspects of number selection SHOULD BE NECESSARY to anticipate the average number chosen.\n3. Adjusting your chosen number based on the results of previous rounds MAY CONTRIBUTE to getting closer to the target number.\n4. Selecting a number significantly higher or lower than the average of previous rounds DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to winning the game.\n5. Observing patterns in the winning numbers MAY BE NECESSARY to inform your strategy.\n6. Factoring in the possibility of other players changing their strategies SHOULD BE NECESSARY for adapting your own approach.\n7. Keeping your chosen number flexible and not fixed on a specific value MAY CONTRIBUTE to a higher chance of winning.\n8. Relying solely on mathematical calculations without considering human behavior DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to consistently predicting the target number.\nLearnings:\n-1. Observing the range within which the winning numbers fall MAY BE NECESSARY to refine your own choice.\n2. Analyzing the variance in chosen numbers from round to round MAY CONTRIBUTE to predicting the average more accurately.\n3. Considering the psychological tendency for players to adjust their numbers based on previous rounds SHOULD BE NECESSARY to anticipate changes in the average number chosen.\n4. Adapting your strategy based on the observed behavior of other players MAY BE NECESSARY to stay competitive.\n5. Recognizing that players may anchor their choices to round numbers (like 10, 20, 30, etc.) MAY CONTRIBUTE to anticipating the average number chosen.\n6. Calculating the average of all chosen numbers excluding your own MAY CONTRIBUTE to a better estimation of the target number.\n7. Being aware that players might overcompensate for previous losses by significantly changing their numbers MAY BE NECESSARY to adapt your strategy.\n8. Considering the possibility of collusion or patterns among other players SHOULD BE NECESSARY for adjusting your chosen number.\n9. Reflecting on the psychological impact of winning and losing numbers on your own decision-making process MAY CONTRIBUTE to more strategic choices.\n10. Realizing that a consistent strategy may become predictable to others MAY BE NECESSARY to maintain an element of surprise in your selections.\nLearnings:\n-1. Analyzing the average numbers chosen in previous rounds MAY BE NECESSARY to estimate future averages.\n2.
