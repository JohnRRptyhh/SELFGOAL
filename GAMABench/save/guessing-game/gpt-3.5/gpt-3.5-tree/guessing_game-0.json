After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Understand Impact: Understand how these outliers affected the average and the target number. Determine if they skewed the results and if they are likely to occur again in the current round.\n - Identify Winning Strategies: Look for any winning strategies or successful number selections that have resulted in closer proximity to the target number. Determine if there are certain ranges or types of numbers that have consistently led to better outcomes.\n - Consider Outliers: Take note of any outlier numbers that significantly deviate from the average or target number. Analyze the impact of these outlier selections on the overall game results.\n - Pay attention to the relationship between the average number chosen, the target number, and the winning number: Analyze how successful players positioned their chosen numbers in relation to the average and target number.\n - Analyze the previous game results: Review the previous game results and identify patterns or trends in your selections compared to the average and winning numbers. Look for any consistent deviations or errors in your estimations.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Consider Recent Results: Take into account the recent results of the game. If you have won multiple rounds in a row, consider whether other players might catch on to your strategy and adjust their selections accordingly.\n - Consider the Range: Given that the numbers chosen by players can range from 0 to 100, consider the potential impact of extreme values on the average and the target number. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on the distribution of numbers chosen by other players.\n - Continuous Learning: Treat each round as a learning opportunity. Continuously refine your approach based on the outcomes of previous rounds and the behavior of other players. Stay open to new insights and adjust your strategy accordingly.\n - Identify Patterns: Look for any patterns in the choices of other players. Are there certain numbers that are frequently chosen? Are there any trends in the proximity of the chosen numbers to the average?\n - Aim for a number that is slightly lower than the average of the numbers chosen by other players: This has been the trend in previous rounds, suggesting that choosing a number slightly lower than the average may increase the chances of success.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Identify Consistent Numbers: Look for numbers that have consistently been close to the target or have appeared multiple times as winning numbers. These numbers may have a higher probability of being closer to the target in future rounds.\n - Track Your Performance: Keep track of your own selections and their proximity to the target number. Identify any patterns in your own choices and adjust your strategy based on past performance.\n - Consider Range Distribution: Analyze the distribution of chosen numbers within the 0-100 range. Look for any specific ranges or clusters of numbers that have been more successful in previous rounds.\n - Analyze Previous Performance: Review the previous rounds and analyze the chosen numbers in relation to the average and target numbers. Identify any patterns or trends in your selections and the winning numbers.\n - Consider the range of numbers: Instead of consistently choosing high or low numbers, aim to select a number within a moderate range that is closer to the average of all numbers chosen.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Consider player behavior: Take into account the behavior of other players in response to previous outcomes. If there has been a consistent overestimation of the average, anticipate that other players may become more conservative in their number selections.\n - Introduce slight variation: While maintaining the core strategy that led to the recent win, consider introducing slight variations in your number selection. This could involve choosing a number that is slightly higher or lower than the previous winning number, or deviating from any obvious patterns that may have emerged.\n - Consider the impact: Think about how your chosen number might impact the overall outcome of the game. If the average is currently close to the target number, a more conservative approach might be beneficial. However, if the average is far from the target, taking a calculated risk could potentially yield better results.\n - Adapt your strategy: Based on the risk assessment, adapt your strategy for the current round. This might involve adjusting your chosen number to align with the current average and target, or taking a more strategic risk if the situation warrants it.\n - Monitor Changes: Keep monitoring the choices of other players in each round. Players may change their strategy based on previous results or new insights. Adapt your predictions and strategy accordingly.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Monitor Variability: Consider the variability in your selections compared to the target number. If there is a consistent pattern of your selections being higher than the target, focus on reducing this variability in your decision-making process.\n - Analyze the historical average numbers chosen by other players: Review the historical average numbers chosen by other players in previous rounds to identify any patterns or trends that may have influenced your risk-taking strategy.\n - Consider the distribution of the chosen numbers: Assess whether the chosen numbers tend to cluster around certain ranges, and analyze how this distribution may have impacted your strategy.\n - Learn from Successful Rounds: Identify the rounds where you won and analyze what factors contributed to your success. Were there specific strategies or insights that led to a closer selection to the target number?\n - Consider the Range: Take note of the range within which the average numbers have been falling. If there is a tendency for the average to be within a specific range (e.g., between 20 and 30), adjust your selection to be within or close to this range.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Avoid Overconfidence: Recognize that the game involves inherent uncertainty, and avoid becoming overly confident in predicting the average or the target number. Each round is independent, and past performance does not guarantee future results.\n - Strategic Observation: Pay attention to the choices made by other players and consider how they may impact the average and the target number. This observation can inform strategic decision-making in subsequent rounds.\n - Consider the range: Since the numbers chosen are between 0 and 100, consider the distribution of numbers chosen in previous rounds and aim to select a number that is within a range that has been successful in the past.\n - Consider recent outcomes: Take into account the recent outcomes of your selections and adjust your strategy accordingly. If your previous selections have been consistently far from the winning number, consider making a more conservative choice.\n - Track Successes and Failures: Keep track of the rounds where you were successful in choosing a number close to the target and the rounds where you were not. Identify any factors or strategies that contributed to your success and apply them in future rounds.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "
