The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nLearnings:\n-1. Observing the average number chosen by all players in each round MAY BE NECESSARY to determine the potential target number.\n2.

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nLearnings:\n-1. Observing the average number chosen by all players in each round MAY BE NECESSARY to determine the target number and make an informed decision.\n2. Considering the distribution of chosen numbers and the range of possible values (0-100) MAY BE NECESSARY to select a number that is closest to 2/3 of the average.\n3. Taking into account the potential strategies of opponents, such as choosing numbers close to the extremes of the range, MAY CONTRIBUTE to making a more competitive selection.\n4. Focusing solely on personal preferences or random selection DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to increasing the chances of winning.\nLearnings:\n-1.

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds.
