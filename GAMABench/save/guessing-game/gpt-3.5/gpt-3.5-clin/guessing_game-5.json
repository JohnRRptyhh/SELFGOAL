After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nLearnings:\n-1. Observing the average number chosen by all players in each round MAY BE NECESSARY to determine the potential target number.\n2.

The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nLearnings:\n-1. Observing the average number chosen by all players in each round MAY BE NECESSARY to determine the target number and make an informed decision.\n2. Considering the distribution of chosen numbers and the range of values selected by opponents MAY BE NECESSARY to strategically position my own selection.\n3. Making a random or arbitrary selection DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to winning the game, as it is important to consider the overall average and target number.\n4. Analyzing the winning number and comparing it to the target number MAY CONTRIBUTE to understanding the optimal strategy for future rounds.\n5. Adapting my selection strategy based on the behavior and choices of opponents MAY BE NECESSARY to increase my chances of winning.\nLearnings:\n-1.

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nLearnings:\n-1. Understanding the distribution of numbers chosen by opponents may be necessary to make an informed decision about your own selection.\n2.

The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nLearnings:\n-1. Observing the average number chosen by all players in each round MAY BE NECESSARY to determine a strategic approach for selecting a number closest to 2/3 of the average.\n2. Considering the distribution of numbers chosen by opponents MAY BE NECESSARY to make an informed decision on the optimal number to select.\n3. Analyzing the winning number in each round MAY CONTRIBUTE to understanding the range of numbers that have been successful in the past, and adjusting future selections accordingly.\n4. Focusing solely on personal preferences and not taking into account the overall average and distribution of numbers chosen by opponents DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to making a winning selection.\nLearnings:\n-1.
