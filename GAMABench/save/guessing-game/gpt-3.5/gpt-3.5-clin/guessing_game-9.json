After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nLearnings:\n-1. Observing the average number chosen by all players in each round MAY BE NECESSARY to determine the potential target number.\n2.

The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nLearnings:\n-1. Observing the average number chosen by all players in each round MAY BE NECESSARY to determine the potential target number and make a strategic decision.\n2. Considering the distribution of chosen numbers and the proximity to the average MAY BE NECESSARY to increase the chances of selecting a winning number.\n3. Making a random selection without considering the average and the potential target number DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to winning the game.\n4. Analyzing the past game results and learning from the winning strategies of other players MAY CONTRIBUTE to improving my own decision-making process.\nLearnings:\n-1.

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nLearnings:\n-1. Understanding the distribution of numbers chosen by opponents MAY BE NECESSARY to predicting the average and target number.\n2. Analyzing past game results MAY CONTRIBUTE to making more informed decisions in future rounds.\n3.

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nLearnings:\n-1.
