After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-Possible reason for failure: It seems that the chosen number was the same as the average, which resulted in winning the round. This may indicate a lack of understanding of the game rules or a miscalculation in selecting a number close to 2/3 of the average.\n\nNew plan: To mitigate this failure, I will focus on better understanding the game rules and aim to select a number that is not the same as the average, but rather closer to 2/3 of the average. I will also pay closer attention to the numbers chosen by other players to make a more informed decision.\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure could be that the chosen number was not close enough to 2/3 of the average in Round 2. To mitigate this, a new plan could be to analyze the historical data of past rounds to identify patterns in the average numbers chosen and adjust the selection strategy accordingly. This could involve considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and making a more informed decision based on that analysis.\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure could be that the chosen number was not close enough to 2/3 of the average in Rounds 2 and 3. To mitigate this, a new plan could be to analyze the historical data of average numbers chosen in previous rounds and adjust the chosen number to be closer to 2/3 of the average in future rounds. This could involve using a more strategic approach to predicting the average and adjusting the chosen number accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that my chosen number is consistently higher than the winning number. This may indicate that I am overestimating the average chosen by other players. To mitigate this, I will focus on selecting a number that is closer to the lower end of the possible range (0-100) in order to better align with the actual average and target number. Additionally, I will pay closer attention to the distribution of numbers chosen by other players in order to make a more informed decision.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in rounds 2 and 3, the chosen number was significantly higher than the average, resulting in a loss. This may indicate a lack of adjustment to the changing average and target number. To mitigate this, the new plan could involve regularly recalculating the average and target number throughout the game and adjusting the chosen number accordingly to stay closer to the target. This would involve a more dynamic and adaptive approach to decision-making.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in a target number that is also higher than the winning number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the strategy to choose numbers that are closer to the average, rather than consistently selecting higher numbers. This could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the chosen numbers, and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly. Additionally, considering the distribution of chosen numbers and aiming for a more balanced approach could also improve the chances of selecting a number closest to the target.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses. This may indicate a tendency to overestimate the average.

To mitigate this, a new plan could be to analyze the historical data to identify the average range of chosen numbers and adjust the selection strategy to be more in line with that range. This could involve choosing numbers closer to the lower end of the range to increase the chances of being closest to the target number.\nReflections:\n-One possible reason for failure could be that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in the target number being higher than the winning number.

This could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the chosen numbers and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure could be that the chosen numbers were not consistently close to 2/3 of the average, leading to inaccurate predictions of the winning number. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the chosen numbers, and then using this analysis to inform future selections. Additionally, incorporating a strategy that takes into account the distribution of chosen numbers and aims to consistently select a number close to 2/3 of the average could improve the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player's selections are not consistently close to 2/3 of the average of all chosen numbers. This may be due to a lack of a clear strategy for selecting numbers. To mitigate this, the player should consider implementing a new strategy that involves analyzing the previous rounds' average numbers and adjusting their selections accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average. This could involve using statistical analysis or pattern recognition to inform their choices.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number, resulting in losses.

This could involve analyzing past game rounds to identify patterns and trends in the chosen numbers and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the reasoning agent's selections were not consistently close to 2/3 of the average of all chosen numbers. This may be due to a lack of adjustment in the agent's strategy based on previous rounds. To mitigate this, the agent should implement a new plan that involves analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the other players' selections, and adjust its own selections accordingly to better align with 2/3 of the average.

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 1, the chosen number of 50 was the winning number, which was also the average number chosen by all players. This suggests that the player may have simply chosen the average number without considering the target number. To mitigate this failure, the new plan should focus on calculating the target number first and then strategically selecting a number that is closest to the target, rather than just the average. This will involve a more thoughtful and strategic approach to decision-making in order to increase the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the chosen number in Round 2 was not close enough to the target number, resulting in a loss. To mitigate this failure, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns in the average numbers chosen by all players and adjusting the chosen number accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average. Additionally, considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and aiming to select a number that is strategically positioned relative to the average could also improve the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2 and Round 3, the chosen number was not close enough to the target number, resulting in a loss. One possible reason for this failure could be a lack of adjustment based on the average number chosen by other players. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could involve analyzing the historical data of average numbers chosen in previous rounds and adjusting the chosen number to be closer to 2/3 of the average, taking into account the distribution of numbers chosen by other players. This would involve a more strategic approach to decision-making based on the collective choices of all players.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the first round, the chosen number was the same as the average, resulting in a win. However, in subsequent rounds, the chosen number was not as close to the target number, resulting in losses. \n\nTo mitigate this, a new high-level plan could be to analyze the historical data of average numbers chosen and target numbers to better understand the distribution and trends. This analysis can then inform the selection of a number that is more likely to be closest to 2/3 of the average in future rounds. Additionally, considering the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjusting the strategy accordingly may also improve the chances of success.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that my chosen number is consistently higher than the winning number. This suggests that I may be overestimating the average chosen by the other players. To mitigate this, I will devise a new plan to better estimate the average chosen number and adjust my selection accordingly. This may involve analyzing the historical data to identify any patterns or trends in the other players' choices, and using that information to make a more informed decision for my own selection in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number.

This suggests that the player may have simply chosen the average number without considering the target number. To mitigate this failure, the new plan should focus on calculating the target number first and then strategically selecting a number that is closest to the target, rather than just the average. This will involve a more thoughtful and strategic approach to decision-making in order to increase the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the chosen number in Round 2 was not close enough to the target number, resulting in a loss. To mitigate this failure, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns in the average numbers chosen by all players and adjusting the chosen number accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average. Additionally, considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and aiming to select a number that is strategically positioned relative to the average could also improve the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2 and Round 3, the chosen number was not close enough to the target number, resulting in a loss. One possible reason for this failure could be a lack of adjustment based on the average number chosen by other players. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could involve analyzing the historical data of average numbers chosen in previous rounds and adjusting the chosen number to be closer to 2/3 of the average, taking into account the distribution of numbers chosen by other players. This would involve a more strategic approach to decision-making based on the collective choices of all players.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the first round, the chosen number was the same as the average, resulting in a win. However, in subsequent rounds, the chosen number was not as close to the target number, resulting in losses. \n\nTo mitigate this, a new high-level plan could be to analyze the historical data of average numbers chosen and target numbers to better understand the distribution and trends. This analysis can then inform the selection of a number that is more likely to be closest to 2/3 of the average in future rounds. Additionally, considering the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjusting the strategy accordingly may also improve the chances of success.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that my chosen number is consistently higher than the winning number. This suggests that I may be overestimating the average chosen by the other players. To mitigate this, I will devise a new plan to better estimate the average chosen number and adjust my selection accordingly.

This could indicate a tendency to overestimate the average and choose a number that is too high.

This indicates a lack of understanding of the game rules and the goal of choosing a number closest to 2/3 of the average.\n\nNew plan: To mitigate this failure, the new plan should focus on a better understanding of the game rules and the goal of choosing a number closest to 2/3 of the average. This can be achieved by analyzing past game rounds, identifying patterns in the chosen numbers, and adjusting the strategy to better align with the target number. Additionally, considering the distribution of chosen numbers and aiming for a number that is not too close to the average can also improve the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of player_3 was not as close to the target number as in Round 1. This could be due to a lack of consideration for the average number chosen by all players. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data of past rounds to identify patterns and trends in the average chosen numbers, and then using this information to make a more informed decision when selecting a number for future rounds. Additionally, considering the distribution of chosen numbers and adjusting the strategy accordingly may also help improve the chances of selecting a winning number.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the past game rounds, the chosen numbers were consistently higher than the average, resulting in a target number that was also higher than the winning number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers in previous rounds to better understand the range of selections made by other players. This analysis can then inform the selection of a number that is more likely to be closest to 2/3 of the average, rather than consistently choosing a number that is higher than the average.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in a target number that is also higher than the winning number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the strategy to choose a number that is closer to the actual average, rather than consistently selecting a higher number. This could involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers in previous rounds and making a more informed decision based on that analysis. Additionally, considering the potential range of numbers chosen by other players and aiming for a number closer to the middle of that range could also improve the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in a failure to win the game. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the strategy to choose a number that is closer to the actual average, rather than consistently selecting a higher number. This could involve analyzing the previous rounds to identify patterns and trends in the chosen numbers, and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number, resulting in losses. This may indicate a tendency to overestimate the average chosen number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the strategy to select a number that is lower than the perceived average, in order to better align with the target number. This could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the chosen numbers, and using this information to inform future selections.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number, resulting in losses. This could indicate a tendency to overestimate the average chosen number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the chosen number to be slightly lower than the perceived average, in order to better align with the target number. This strategy aims to improve the chances of winning by being more conservative in the selection process.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in a failure to win.

This may indicate a tendency to overestimate the average of all chosen numbers. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could involve adjusting the strategy to select numbers that are slightly lower than the perceived average, in order to better align with the target number. Additionally, incorporating a more systematic approach to analyzing past game results and adjusting future selections accordingly could also be beneficial.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in consistently losing rounds. This may indicate a misunderstanding of the game's strategy or a lack of adjustment based on previous results. To mitigate this, the new plan should involve analyzing past game results to understand the distribution of chosen numbers and adjust the selection strategy to be closer to the average in future rounds. This will involve a more thoughtful and strategic approach to selecting a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number, resulting in repeated losses. This suggests a possible failure to accurately estimate the average and calculate the target number. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could involve adjusting the strategy to choose numbers that are closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than consistently aiming for higher numbers. This could involve analyzing the historical data to better understand the distribution of chosen numbers and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in consistently losing rounds. This may indicate a misunderstanding of the game's objective or a lack of strategy in selecting numbers.

To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could be to analyze the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the average numbers chosen by all players, and then use this analysis to make a more informed decision when selecting a number for future rounds. This could involve adjusting the chosen number based on the average trend to increase the chances of being closest to 2/3 of the average.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the past game rounds, the chosen number by player_4 was consistently higher than the target number. This suggests a possible overestimation of the average chosen number by all players. To mitigate this, player_4 should consider adjusting their chosen number to be closer to the lower end of the range, as the target number tends to be lower than expected. Additionally, player_4 could benefit from analyzing the historical data of all players' chosen numbers to better gauge the average and adjust their strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that my chosen number is consistently higher than the winning number. This may indicate that I am overestimating the average chosen by other players. To mitigate this, I will focus on selecting a number that is closer to the lower end of the possible range (0-100) in order to better align with the actual average and target number. Additionally, I will pay closer attention to the distribution of numbers chosen by other players in order to make a more informed decision.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the first few rounds, the chosen numbers were consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses.

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-Possible reason for failure: It seems that the chosen number was the same as the average, which resulted in winning the round. This indicates a lack of strategic thinking and understanding of the game rules.\n\nNew plan: Moving forward, I will aim to choose a number that is strategically calculated to be closest to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply selecting a number that matches the average. This will involve analyzing the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and making a more informed decision based on that analysis.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 45 was not as close to the target number of 27.33 as the winning number of 35. This may indicate a miscalculation or misjudgment in selecting a number that is closest to 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve implementing a more precise calculation method or strategy for determining the optimal number to choose, such as considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and adjusting accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that my chosen number in Round 2 was too high, resulting in a loss. It's possible that I overestimated the average chosen number and didn't adjust my selection accordingly. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan to closely monitor the trend of average chosen numbers in each round and adjust my selection to be more conservative or aggressive based on the trend. This will help me make a more accurate prediction of the target number and increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers by player_5 are consistently higher than the winning numbers. This may indicate a tendency to overestimate the average and choose a number that is too high.

This indicates a lack of strategic thinking and understanding of the game rules.\n\nNew plan: Moving forward, I will aim to choose a number that is strategically calculated to be closest to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply selecting a number that matches the average. This will involve analyzing the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and making a more informed decision based on that analysis.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 45 was not as close to the target number of 27.33 as the winning number of 35. This may indicate a miscalculation or misjudgment in selecting a number that is closest to 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve implementing a more precise calculation method or strategy for determining the optimal number to choose, such as considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and adjusting accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that my chosen number in Round 2 was too high, resulting in a loss. It's possible that I overestimated the average chosen number and didn't adjust my selection accordingly. To mitigate this failure, I will devise a new plan to closely monitor the trend of average chosen numbers in each round and adjust my selection to be more conservative or aggressive based on the trend. This will help me make a more accurate prediction of the target number and increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers by player_5 are consistently higher than the winning numbers. This may indicate a tendency to overestimate the average and choose a number that is too high. To mitigate this, player_5 should consider selecting a number that is slightly lower than their initial instinct, and also take into account the distribution of numbers chosen by other players to make a more informed decision. This will help in increasing the chances of selecting a number closer to 2/3 of the average and improve the likelihood of winning the game.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_5 are consistently higher than the winning numbers. This suggests that player_5 may be overestimating the average chosen by other players. To mitigate this, player_5 should consider selecting a number that is closer to the lower end of the possible range (0-100) to better align with the actual average and target number. Additionally, player_5 could benefit from analyzing the historical data of past rounds to better understand the distribution of chosen numbers and adjust their strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_5 are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses.

To mitigate this, a new plan could be to encourage players to choose a wider range of numbers, rather than clustering around the middle. This could be achieved by providing incentives for selecting numbers that are further from the average, or by implementing a rule that limits the number of players who can choose the same number. This would help to ensure a more varied distribution of chosen numbers and increase the likelihood of a more accurate target number.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 40 was not as close to the target number of 27.33 as it needed to be in order to win. This may be due to a miscalculation or misjudgment of the average and target number.

This indicates a lack of strategic thinking and understanding of the game dynamics.\n\nNew plan: Moving forward, I will analyze the historical data to understand the distribution of chosen numbers and the average calculations. I will then devise a strategy to choose a number that is not only close to the average but also strategically positioned to increase my chances of winning. This may involve considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and adjusting my selection accordingly.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 40 was not as close to the target number of 27.33 as it needed to be in order to win. This may be due to a miscalculation or misjudgment of the average and target number. To mitigate this failure, a new plan could involve double-checking the calculations and taking more time to consider the best number to choose in relation to the average and target number. Additionally, considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players may also help in making a more informed decision.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the last two rounds, my chosen number was not as close to the target number as it was in the first round. This could be due to a lack of adjustment based on the average number chosen by other players. To mitigate this, I will analyze the historical data of average numbers chosen by other players and adjust my chosen number accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average. This will involve a more strategic approach to decision-making based on the collective choices of all players.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen number by player_8 is consistently higher than the winning number. This suggests a possible failure to accurately estimate the 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, player_8 should consider adjusting their strategy to choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average rather than consistently selecting a higher number. This can be achieved by carefully analyzing the average number chosen by other players and making a more precise estimation of the target number.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number, resulting in losses.

To mitigate this failure, the player should consider using a more strategic approach, such as analyzing the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and adjusting their own selection accordingly. Additionally, the player could implement a systematic method for choosing numbers, such as selecting a number that is slightly higher or lower than the average of previous rounds. This approach may increase the likelihood of choosing a number closest to 2/3 of the average and improve the player's overall performance in the game.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player consistently chose numbers that were higher than the target number, resulting in multiple losses. To mitigate this failure, the player should consider selecting numbers closer to the 2/3 average of all chosen numbers, rather than consistently choosing higher numbers. A new high-level plan could involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers in previous rounds and adjusting the player's selections to be more in line with the 2/3 average. Additionally, the player could consider using statistical methods to predict the average and adjust their selection accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player consistently failed to choose a number closest to the target number in the later rounds. This could be due to a lack of adjustment in strategy as the average number chosen by all players decreased. To mitigate this failure, the player should consider adjusting their strategy to choose lower numbers as the average decreases, in order to increase the likelihood of selecting a number closest to the target.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player consistently chose numbers that were too high or too low, resulting in several losses. To mitigate this, the player should consider using a more strategic approach, such as analyzing the distribution of numbers chosen by other players in previous rounds and adjusting their own selection accordingly. This could involve identifying patterns or trends in the chosen numbers and using that information to make a more informed decision for future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player consistently failed to choose a number close to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players. This may be due to a lack of adjustment in strategy based on the changing average numbers in each round. To mitigate this failure, the player should consider implementing a new strategy that involves closely monitoring the average numbers in each round and adjusting their chosen number accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average. This could involve using a mathematical formula or algorithm to calculate the optimal number based on the average.\n\n```"

However, this may have been a lucky guess rather than a strategic choice based on the target number.\n\nNew plan: In future rounds, I will aim to choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply matching the average. This will involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers and making a more informed decision based on the target number.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the player's chosen number in Round 1 was the same as the average, which resulted in a win. However, in Round 2, the player's chosen number was not as close to the target number as in Round 1, resulting in a loss. To mitigate this, the player should aim to consistently choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply matching the average. This can be achieved by analyzing the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and adjusting the player's own selection accordingly.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the chosen number of 40 in Round 3 was too high, resulting in a loss. It seems that the player may have overestimated the average and chosen a number that was too far from 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this failure, the player should consider analyzing the historical data of past rounds to better understand the range of chosen numbers and adjust their strategy accordingly. Additionally, the player should aim to choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than overestimating the average.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen number of 40 in Round 3 was too high, resulting in a loss. To mitigate this failure, a new plan could involve analyzing the trend of average numbers chosen in previous rounds and adjusting the chosen number to be closer to the average in order to increase the chances of winning. This would involve a more strategic approach to selecting a number that is more likely to be closest to 2/3 of the average.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen number of 40 in Round 3 was too high, resulting in a loss. This may indicate a tendency to overestimate the average chosen number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical average chosen numbers and adjusting the selection strategy to be more conservative, aiming for a number slightly lower than the perceived average. This approach may help to increase the chances of selecting a number closest to 2/3 of the average in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_9 are consistently higher than the winning numbers. This suggests that player_9 may be overestimating the average chosen by the other players. To mitigate this, player_9 should consider selecting a number slightly lower than their initial estimate of the average, in order to increase the chances of being closest to 2/3 of the actual average. Additionally, player_9 should pay closer attention to the trend of the average numbers chosen by other players in previous rounds to inform their decision for the next round.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_9 are consistently higher than the winning numbers. This suggests a possible failure in accurately estimating the 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, player_9 should consider adjusting their strategy to choose numbers that are closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than consistently selecting higher numbers.

This may be due to a lack of adjustment in strategy based on the changing average numbers in each round. To mitigate this failure, the player should devise a new plan to dynamically adjust their chosen number based on the average number chosen in each round, rather than sticking to a static strategy. This could involve analyzing the trend of average numbers and making a more informed decision based on that analysis.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player consistently chose numbers that were too high or too low, resulting in frequent losses. To mitigate this, the player should consider a new strategy that involves analyzing the distribution of numbers chosen by other players in previous rounds and adjusting their own selection accordingly. This new strategy should aim to choose a number that is closer to the average of all numbers chosen, rather than simply selecting a number based on intuition or personal preference.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player consistently chose numbers that were too high or too low, resulting in multiple losses. To mitigate this failure, the player should consider using a more strategic approach, such as analyzing the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and adjusting their own selection accordingly.
