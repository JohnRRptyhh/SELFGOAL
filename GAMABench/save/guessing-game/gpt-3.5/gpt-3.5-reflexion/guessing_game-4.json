After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-Possible reason for failure: It seems that the chosen number was the same as the average, which resulted in winning the round. This may indicate a lack of understanding of the game rules or a miscalculation in selecting a number close to 2/3 of the average.\n\nNew plan: To mitigate this failure, I will focus on better understanding the game rules and aim to select a number that is not the same as the average, but rather close to 2/3 of the average. I will also pay closer attention to the numbers chosen by other players to make a more informed decision.\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure could be that the chosen number was not close enough to 2/3 of the average in Round 2. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could be to analyze the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the average numbers chosen by all players in previous rounds. This analysis can help in making a more informed decision when selecting a number for future rounds, increasing the chances of choosing a number closer to 2/3 of the average.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the first few rounds, my chosen number was not as close to the target number as it could have been. This may be due to not fully considering the average of all chosen numbers and how it relates to the target number. To mitigate this, I will start by calculating the average of all chosen numbers and then aim to select a number that is closer to 2/3 of that average in future rounds. This will require a more strategic approach to my number selection, taking into account the choices of other players and the overall average.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that my chosen number is consistently not close enough to the target number. This could be due to a lack of strategy in selecting my number. To mitigate this, I will start analyzing the previous rounds to understand the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjust my selection accordingly. Additionally, I will consider the average of the previous rounds to make a more informed decision for the next round.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in rounds 2, 3, and 4, the chosen number was not close enough to the target number, resulting in a loss. This could be due to a lack of adjustment based on the average number chosen by other players. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data of average numbers chosen by other players and adjusting the chosen number accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average. This would involve a more strategic approach to decision-making based on the collective input of all players.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it seems that the chosen numbers are not consistently close to 2/3 of the average, leading to losses in some rounds. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the chosen numbers, and then adjusting the selection strategy to better align with the target number. This could involve considering the distribution of past chosen numbers and making adjustments to ensure that the chosen number is more likely to be closer to 2/3 of the average.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in a failure to win in most rounds. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the strategy to choose numbers that are closer to the actual average, rather than consistently aiming for higher numbers. This could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the chosen numbers, and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the chosen numbers are consistently falling short of the target number. This could be due to a lack of understanding of the game's mechanics or a miscalculation of the target number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve more careful calculation of the target number and a better understanding of how the average and target number are related. Additionally, considering the distribution of chosen numbers and adjusting the strategy accordingly could also improve the chances of success.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the chosen numbers are consistently too low compared to the average, resulting in losses. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the strategy to select numbers that are closer to the average, rather than consistently choosing lower numbers. This could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the chosen numbers, and using this information to inform future selections. Additionally, considering the distribution of chosen numbers and aiming for a more balanced approach could also improve the chances of selecting a number closest to the target.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses. This may indicate a tendency to overestimate the average and choose a number that is too high. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the strategy to choose a number that is closer to the lower end of the possible range, while still considering the average of all chosen numbers. This may increase the chances of selecting a number closer to 2/3 of the average and improve the likelihood of winning.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses. This may indicate a misunderstanding of the game's objective or a lack of strategy in selecting numbers. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the chosen numbers, and then adjusting the selection strategy to better align with the average and target number. Additionally, considering the distribution of chosen numbers and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly could also improve the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure could be that the chosen numbers were not consistently close to 2/3 of the average, leading to a lack of accuracy in predicting the winning number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the average numbers chosen and adjusting the strategy to select numbers that are consistently closer to 2/3 of the average. This could involve using statistical analysis to make more informed decisions and increase the chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the strategy to choose numbers that are closer to the actual average, rather than consistently aiming for higher numbers.

To mitigate this, the player should consider adjusting their strategy to consistently choose numbers closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply selecting numbers they believe to be close to the average. This may involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers in previous rounds and adjusting their selections accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the reasoning agent's selections were not consistently close to the target number. This could be due to a lack of adjustment based on previous rounds' results. To mitigate this, the agent should incorporate a learning mechanism that analyzes past game results and adjusts its selection strategy accordingly. This could involve tracking the distance between its chosen number and the winning number in each round and using this information to inform future selections.\n\n```"

This may indicate a lack of understanding of the game rules or a miscalculation in selecting a number close to 2/3 of the average.\n\nNew plan: To mitigate this failure, I will focus on better understanding the game rules and aim to select a number that is not the same as the average, but rather close to 2/3 of the average. I will also pay closer attention to the numbers chosen by other players to make a more informed decision.\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure could be that the chosen number was not close enough to 2/3 of the average in Round 2. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could be to analyze the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the average numbers chosen by all players in previous rounds. This analysis can help in making a more informed decision when selecting a number for future rounds, increasing the chances of choosing a number closer to 2/3 of the average.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the first few rounds, my chosen number was not as close to the target number as it could have been. This may be due to not fully considering the average of all chosen numbers and how it relates to the target number. To mitigate this, I will start by calculating the average of all chosen numbers and then aim to select a number that is closer to 2/3 of that average in future rounds.

This suggests that the strategy of selecting the average number may not always be successful, as it did not result in the target number of 33.33. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could be to consider the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and aim to select a number that is strategically positioned relative to the distribution, rather than simply aiming for the average.

This suggests that the strategy of selecting the average number may not always be successful, as it did not result in the target number of 33.33. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could be to consider the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and aim to select a number that is strategically positioned relative to the distribution, rather than simply aiming for the average. This could involve analyzing past game rounds to identify patterns and trends in the numbers chosen by other players, and using this information to inform the selection of a number that is more likely to be closest to 2/3 of the average.\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure could be that the chosen number was not close enough to 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could be to analyze the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the average numbers chosen by other players, and adjust the chosen number accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average. This could involve using statistical analysis or machine learning algorithms to make more informed decisions.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in a target number that is also higher than the winning number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve selecting a number that is slightly lower than the perceived average, in order to increase the chances of being closest to the target number. This strategy aims to adjust for the consistently higher average and target numbers observed in the past rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen number was consistently higher than the winning number in each round. This suggests that I may be overestimating the average chosen by the other players. To mitigate this, I will devise a new plan to adjust my strategy by considering the possibility of the average being lower than my initial estimation. This will involve selecting a number that is closer to the lower end of the range (0-100) to increase my chances of being closest to 2/3 of the average.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that my chosen number is consistently higher than the winning number. This suggests that I may be overestimating the average chosen by the other players.

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-Possible reason for failure: It seems that the chosen number of 50 was the same as the average number, resulting in a win. However, this may have been a lucky guess rather than a strategic choice based on the target number.\n\nNew plan: In future rounds, I will aim to choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply matching the average. This will involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers and making a more informed decision based on the target number.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that the chosen numbers by the players are consistently higher than the average, resulting in the target number being higher as well. This may indicate a tendency for players to overestimate the average and choose higher numbers. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify the average deviation from the target number and adjust the chosen number accordingly to be closer to the target. Additionally, implementing a strategy to consider the distribution of chosen numbers and adjust the selection based on the overall trend could also improve the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 3, the chosen number of 35 was not as close to the target number as in previous rounds. This could be due to a lack of consideration for the specific average and target number in that round. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the average and target number more carefully in each round and adjusting the chosen number accordingly to be as close to 2/3 of the average as possible. This may involve a more precise calculation and consideration of the specific numbers chosen by other players in that round.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 3 and Round 4, the chosen number by player_3 was significantly higher than the winning number. This suggests that player_3 may have overestimated the average chosen by the other players, leading to a higher target number. To mitigate this, player_3 should consider the range of numbers chosen by other players and aim for a number closer to the lower end of the potential average. A new plan could involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers in previous rounds and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly to better align with the average and target number.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the rounds where I lost, my chosen number was significantly higher than the winning number. This suggests that I may have overestimated the average chosen by the other players. To mitigate this, I will focus on analyzing the historical data to better understand the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjust my strategy accordingly. Additionally, I will aim to choose a number that is closer to the lower end of the potential average range to increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the rounds where you lost, your chosen number was consistently higher than the winning number. This suggests that you may be overestimating the average chosen by the other players. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data of the average chosen numbers in previous rounds to better estimate the average for future rounds. Additionally, considering a wider range of potential target numbers based on the historical averages may also improve your chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen number by player_3 is consistently higher than the winning number. This suggests a possible failure to accurately estimate the 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, player_3 should consider adjusting their strategy to choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than consistently selecting a higher number. This could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the average and target numbers, and adjusting their selection accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers by player_3 were consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses in multiple rounds. To mitigate this, player_3 should aim to select a number closer to the calculated average in future rounds. A new high-level plan could involve analyzing the trend of chosen numbers in previous rounds and adjusting the selection strategy to be more in line with the average, increasing the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the chosen numbers by player_3 were consistently higher than the winning numbers in the early rounds, leading to losses. To mitigate this, player_3 should consider selecting lower numbers that are closer to the average in future rounds. A new plan could involve analyzing the trend of chosen numbers in previous rounds and adjusting the selection strategy to be more in line with the average and target number. This could involve considering the distribution of chosen numbers and aiming for a more balanced approach to increase the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_3 were consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses in most rounds. To mitigate this, player_3 should aim to select a number closer to the average in future rounds, rather than consistently choosing higher numbers. A high level plan to achieve this could involve analyzing the historical data to identify the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjusting player_3's selection strategy accordingly. Additionally, player_3 could consider using statistical methods to predict the average and target number more accurately.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_3 were consistently higher than the winning numbers. This suggests a possible failure to accurately estimate the 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could involve adjusting the strategy to choose numbers that are closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than consistently aiming for higher numbers. This could involve recalibrating the estimation process and considering the distribution of other players' chosen numbers in relation to the average.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the chosen numbers by player_3 were consistently higher than the average of all numbers chosen by players, resulting in losses in most rounds. To mitigate this, player_3 should aim to select a number closer to the average in future rounds. A new high-level plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify the range of numbers chosen by other players and strategically selecting a number within that range to increase the chances of being closest to 2/3 of the average.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player consistently chose numbers that were too high, resulting in losses in most rounds. To mitigate this failure, the player should aim to choose numbers that are closer to the lower end of the range (0-100) in order to increase the likelihood of being closest to 2/3 of the average. Additionally, the player should consider the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and adjust their selection accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers were consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses.

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that the chosen number of 50 was the winning number for Round 1, as it was closest to the target number of 33.33. However, it seems that the chosen number and the target number were the same in this instance, which may indicate a potential phrasing discrepancy or misunderstanding of the game rules. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve a thorough review and clarification of the game rules to ensure a clear understanding of how the target number is calculated and how to choose a number closest to it. Additionally, implementing a double-checking process for chosen numbers against the target number calculation could help prevent similar discrepancies in the future.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 40 was not as close to the target number of 26.67 as the winning number of 30. This may indicate a miscalculation or misjudgment in selecting a number that is closest to 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could involve implementing a more precise calculation method or strategy for determining the optimal number to choose, such as considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and adjusting accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen number by player_4 is consistently higher than the average number chosen by all players, resulting in a failure to win the game. To mitigate this, player_4 should aim to choose a number closer to the average in future rounds, rather than consistently selecting a higher number. This can be achieved by analyzing the previous rounds and adjusting the chosen number accordingly to be closer to the average.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_4 are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses in the game rounds.

This indicates a lack of strategic thinking and understanding of the game dynamics.\n\nNew plan: Moving forward, I will analyze the historical data to understand the distribution of chosen numbers and the resulting average. I will then strategically choose a number that is close to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply selecting a number that matches the average. This will involve a more thoughtful and analytical approach to improve my chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure could be that the chosen number was not close enough to 2/3 of the average in Round 2. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could be to analyze the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the average numbers chosen by all players, and adjust the chosen number accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average in future rounds. Additionally, considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and aiming to be strategically different from the majority could also improve the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 40 was not as close to the target number of 26.67 as it could have been. This may have been due to a lack of consideration for the average number chosen by other players. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could involve analyzing the historical data of past rounds to better understand the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjust the selection accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average.

This may be due to a lack of a clear strategy for selecting the number. To mitigate this, player_5 should consider implementing a new strategy that involves analyzing the previous rounds' average numbers and adjusting their chosen number accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average. This new strategy will involve a more thoughtful and data-driven approach to decision-making.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the failure in Round 11 may be due to a miscalculation or misunderstanding of the target number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve double-checking the calculation of the target number before making a selection and ensuring a clear understanding of the game rules to avoid any phrasing discrepancies.

This will help in making more accurate and informed choices in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player's chosen number in round 11 was significantly higher than the average, resulting in a loss. To mitigate this failure, the player should consider adjusting their strategy to choose a number closer to the average in future rounds. A new high-level plan could involve analyzing the trend of the average numbers chosen in previous rounds and selecting a number that aligns more closely with that trend to increase the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the reason for failure in rounds 11, 13, and 14 may be due to selecting a number that was too far from 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjusting the selection strategy to be closer to the average of those numbers. This could increase the chances of selecting a number closer to 2/3 of the average and improve the likelihood of winning.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player consistently chose a number that was too low in the later rounds, resulting in losses. This may be due to a lack of adjustment for the increasing average numbers chosen by other players. To mitigate this, the player should consider implementing a strategy that takes into account the trend of increasing average numbers and adjust their selections accordingly to stay competitive in the game.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player consistently chose numbers that were too high or too low, resulting in several losses. To mitigate this, the player should consider using a more strategic approach, such as analyzing the distribution of numbers chosen by other players in previous rounds and adjusting their own selection accordingly. Additionally, the player could implement a systematic method for choosing numbers, such as selecting a number that is slightly higher or lower than the average of previous rounds. This approach may increase the likelihood of choosing a number closest to 2/3 of the average and improve the player's overall performance in the game.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the reason for failure in some rounds may be due to not accurately predicting the target number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the average numbers chosen and the corresponding target numbers. This analysis can then be used to inform a more strategic approach to selecting a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average. Additionally, incorporating a more systematic method for decision-making, such as using statistical techniques or algorithms, could help improve the accuracy of number selection.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player consistently chose a number that was too high or too low compared to the target number. This may be due to a lack of adjustment based on the historical average numbers chosen by other players. To mitigate this, the player should consider incorporating a strategy that takes into account the historical average numbers chosen by other players and adjusts their selection accordingly to be closer to the target number. This could involve analyzing the distribution of past chosen numbers and making a more informed decision based on that analysis.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player consistently chose a number that was not closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players. This may be due to a lack of adjustment in strategy as the average number chosen by all players fluctuated. To mitigate this, the player should consider implementing a dynamic strategy that adjusts their chosen number based on the average number chosen by all players in each round, rather than sticking to a static number. This will increase the chances of selecting a number closest to the target number.\n",

You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-Possible reason for failure: It seems that the chosen number of 50 was the same as the average number, which resulted in winning the round. This indicates a lack of strategic thinking and understanding of the game dynamics.\n\nNew plan: Moving forward, I will analyze the historical data to understand the distribution of chosen numbers and the average. I will aim to choose a number that is strategically positioned to be closest to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply matching the average. This will involve a more thoughtful and strategic approach to decision-making in order to increase the chances of winning future rounds.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 40 was not as close to the target number of 26.67 as the winning number of 30. This may indicate a miscalculation or misjudgment in selecting a number that is closest to 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve implementing a more precise calculation method or considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players to make a more informed decision. Additionally, it may be beneficial to analyze the historical data to identify any patterns or trends in the numbers chosen by other players.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the past game rounds, the chosen numbers were not consistently close to the target number, resulting in losses. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the chosen numbers, and then using this analysis to inform future number selections. Additionally, implementing a strategy that involves adjusting the chosen number based on the average and target number could improve the chances of success in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the past game rounds, the chosen numbers were consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses.

This indicates a lack of strategic thinking and understanding of the game dynamics.\n\nNew plan: Moving forward, I will analyze the historical data to understand the distribution of chosen numbers and the average. I will aim to choose a number that is strategically positioned to be closest to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply matching the average. This will involve a more thoughtful and strategic approach to decision-making in order to increase the chances of winning future rounds.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 40 was not as close to the target number of 26.67 as the winning number of 30. This may indicate a miscalculation or misjudgment in selecting a number that is closest to 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve implementing a more precise calculation method or considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players to make a more informed decision. Additionally, it may be beneficial to analyze the historical data to identify any patterns or trends in the numbers chosen by other players.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the past game rounds, the chosen numbers were not consistently close to the target number, resulting in losses.

However, this may have been a lucky guess rather than a strategic choice based on the target number.\n\nNew plan: To mitigate this, I will analyze the historical data from past game rounds to identify patterns and trends in the chosen numbers. I will then use this analysis to make a more informed decision when selecting my number, aiming to be closer to 2/3 of the average rather than just matching it. This will involve a more strategic approach to increase the chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 45 was not as close to the target number of 26.67 as it needed to be in order to win.

However, this may have been a lucky guess rather than a strategic choice based on the target number.\n\nNew plan: In future rounds, I will aim to choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply matching the average. This will involve analyzing the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and making a more informed decision based on the target number.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 40 was not as close to the target number of 26.67 as it could have been. This may be due to a lack of consideration for the average number chosen by other players. To mitigate this failure, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data of past rounds to identify patterns in the average numbers chosen and adjusting the chosen number accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average. This would involve a more strategic approach to decision-making based on the collective choices of all players.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that the chosen number of 45 in Round 3 was significantly higher than the average and the target number. This may indicate a lack of adjustment to the changing average and target numbers in each round. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve implementing a strategy to dynamically adjust the chosen number based on the current average and target number, rather than sticking to a fixed number. This could involve using a formula or algorithm to calculate the optimal number based on the current game conditions.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in a target number that is also higher than the winning number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve selecting a number that is closer to the average rather than aiming for a higher number. This could involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers and adjusting the strategy to be more in line with the average. Additionally, considering the potential range of numbers chosen by other players could also help in making a more strategic selection.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the past game rounds, the chosen numbers by player_9 were consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses.
