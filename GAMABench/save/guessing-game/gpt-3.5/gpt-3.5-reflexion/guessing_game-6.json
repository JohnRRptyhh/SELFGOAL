After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-Possible reason for failure: It appears that the chosen number of 50 was the same as the average number, resulting in a win. However, this may have been a lucky guess rather than a strategic choice based on the target number.\n\nNew plan: In future rounds, I will aim to choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply matching the average. This will involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers and making a more informed decision based on the target number.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number. This could be due to a lack of consideration for the average of all numbers chosen by players when making selections. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify the average chosen number and then strategically selecting a number that is closer to 2/3 of that average in future rounds. This would involve a more thoughtful and data-driven approach to decision making.\nReflections:\n-It appears that there is no failure or phrasing discrepancy in the game log, as you have consistently chosen numbers that were closest to 2/3 of the average. However, to continue your success in future rounds, you may want to consider incorporating a more strategic approach by analyzing the previous rounds' average numbers and adjusting your selection accordingly to increase your chances of winning. This could involve identifying any patterns or trends in the average numbers and using that information to inform your decision-making process for future rounds.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 4, the chosen number of 26 was not as close to the target number of 25 as it was in previous rounds. This could be due to a miscalculation or misjudgment of the average and target number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve double-checking the calculations and taking more time to consider the best number to choose in relation to the average and target number. Additionally, considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players may also help in making a more accurate selection.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 4 and Round 5, the chosen number was not as close to the target number as in the previous rounds. This could be due to a lack of adjustment based on the average number chosen by other players. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the trend of the average numbers chosen in previous rounds and adjusting the chosen number accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average. This would involve a more dynamic and adaptive approach to decision-making in each round.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen number by player_0 was consistently higher than the winning number in the later rounds, leading to losses. This suggests a possible failure to accurately predict the target number based on the average chosen by all players. To mitigate this, player_0 should consider adjusting their strategy to choose a number closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than consistently aiming for a higher number. This may involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers in previous rounds and adjusting their selection accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player's chosen number was consistently higher than the winning number in the later rounds. This suggests a possible failure to accurately predict the target number based on the average of all chosen numbers. To mitigate this, the player should consider adjusting their strategy to choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than consistently aiming for a higher number. This may involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers and adjusting their selection accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it seems that the player's chosen number is consistently higher than the winning number. This could indicate a tendency to overestimate the average chosen by other players. To mitigate this, the player could consider adjusting their chosen number to be slightly lower than their initial estimate of the average, in order to increase the chances of being closest to 2/3 of the actual average. This strategy aims to counteract the tendency to consistently choose a number that is higher than the winning number.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it seems that the player's chosen numbers were consistently higher than the winning numbers. This could indicate a failure to accurately estimate the 2/3 of the average of all chosen numbers. To mitigate this, the player should consider adjusting their strategy to choose numbers that are closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than consistently aiming for higher numbers. This may involve re-evaluating the approach to estimating the target number and making more conservative number selections.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it seems that the chosen numbers by player_0 were consistently higher than the winning numbers. This could indicate a failure to accurately predict the target number based on the average chosen by all players. To mitigate this, player_0 should consider adjusting their strategy to choose numbers that are closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than consistently selecting higher numbers. This could involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers and adjusting their selections accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player's chosen number was consistently higher than the winning number in the rounds where they lost. This suggests a possible failure to accurately estimate the 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, the player should focus on refining their estimation of 2/3 of the average by considering a wider range of numbers and adjusting their selection accordingly. Additionally, they could benefit from analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the average numbers chosen by other players.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the player's chosen number was not consistently close to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players. This inconsistency may be due to a lack of a clear strategy for selecting the number. To mitigate this, the player should consider implementing a new strategy that involves analyzing the previous rounds' average numbers and adjusting their chosen number accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average. This strategy will require the player to be more mindful of the overall distribution of numbers chosen by other players and adjust their selection accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player's chosen numbers were consistently higher than the winning numbers, resulting in repeated losses. To mitigate this, the player should consider adjusting their strategy to choose numbers closer to the 2/3 average of all numbers chosen by players, rather than consistently selecting higher numbers. This may involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers in previous rounds and adjusting their selection accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it seems that the reason for failure in some rounds may be due to not accurately predicting the average chosen number and the target number. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could involve analyzing the historical data to better understand the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjusting the strategy to select a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average based on this analysis. Additionally, considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and making a more informed decision based on this analysis could also improve the chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player's chosen numbers were not consistently close to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players. This inconsistency may be due to a lack of a clear strategy for selecting numbers. To mitigate this, the player should devise a new plan that involves analyzing past average numbers and target numbers to better understand the range of numbers chosen by other players, and then use this analysis to inform their own number selection in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player's chosen number was consistently higher than the winning number in the later rounds. This may indicate a failure to accurately predict the average and adjust the chosen number accordingly. To mitigate this, the player should consider analyzing the trend of the average numbers chosen in previous rounds and adjust their chosen number to be closer to 2/3 of the average. Additionally, the player could implement a strategy to vary their chosen number based on the trend of the average numbers chosen in previous rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player's chosen numbers were consistently higher than the winning numbers in the later rounds. This suggests a possible failure to accurately predict the target number based on the average of all chosen numbers. To mitigate this, the player should consider adjusting their strategy to choose numbers that are closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than consistently aiming for higher numbers. This may involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers and adjusting their selections accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player consistently failed to choose a number closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players. This may be due to a lack of adjustment in strategy based on the changing average numbers in each round. To mitigate this failure, the player should consider implementing a dynamic strategy that takes into account the fluctuating average numbers and adjusts their chosen number accordingly in each round. This could involve analyzing the trend of average numbers and making a more informed decision based on the current game dynamics.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the reasoning agent's selections were not consistently close to 2/3 of the average of all chosen numbers. This may be due to a lack of adjustment in the agent's strategy based on the historical data. To mitigate this, the agent should analyze the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the average numbers chosen and adjust its strategy accordingly to select numbers closer to 2/3 of the average in future rounds.\n\n```"

However, this may have been a lucky guess rather than a strategic choice based on the target number.\n\nNew plan: In future rounds, I will aim to choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply matching the average. This will involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers and making a more informed decision based on the target number.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number. This could be due to a lack of consideration for the average of all numbers chosen by players when making selections. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify the average chosen number and then strategically selecting a number that is closer to 2/3 of that average in future rounds. This would involve a more thoughtful and data-driven approach to decision making.\nReflections:\n-It appears that there is no failure or phrasing discrepancy in the game log, as you have consistently chosen numbers that were closest to 2/3 of the average. However, to continue your success in future rounds, you may want to consider incorporating a more strategic approach by analyzing the previous rounds' average numbers and adjusting your selection accordingly to increase your chances of winning.

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 1, the winning number was the same as the average number chosen, which is highly unlikely in this game. This could be due to players not fully understanding the game rules or not strategizing effectively. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve providing clearer instructions and examples of strategic number selection to all players before the start of each round. Additionally, encouraging players to think critically about their number selection and consider the potential choices of others could lead to more diverse and strategic number selections.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 45 was not as close to the target number of 25.67 as it could have been. This may be due to a lack of consideration for the average number chosen by all players. To mitigate this failure, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data of past game rounds to identify patterns and trends in the average numbers chosen, and then using this information to inform the selection of a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average. Additionally, considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players may also help in making a more informed decision.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that my chosen number in Round 2 was too high, resulting in a loss. It's possible that I overestimated the average chosen number and didn't adjust my selection accordingly. To mitigate this, I will devise a new plan to closely monitor the trend of average chosen numbers in each round and adjust my selection to be more in line with the actual average, rather than relying on a fixed number. This will involve a more dynamic and adaptive approach to my number selection.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in rounds 2 and 3, the chosen number was significantly higher than the winning number, resulting in a loss. This may indicate a tendency to overestimate the average chosen number and select a number that is too high. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to better understand the range of chosen numbers and adjust the selection strategy to be more conservative, aiming for a number closer to the lower end of the potential average range. This could increase the chances of selecting a number closer to 2/3 of the average and improve the likelihood of winning.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in a target number that is also higher than the winning number.

This could be due to players not fully understanding the game rules or not strategizing effectively. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve providing clearer instructions and examples of strategic number selection to all players before the start of each round. Additionally, encouraging players to think critically about their number selection and consider the potential choices of others could lead to more diverse and strategic number selections.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 45 was not as close to the target number of 25.67 as it could have been. This may be due to a lack of consideration for the average number chosen by all players. To mitigate this failure, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data of past game rounds to identify patterns and trends in the average numbers chosen, and then using this information to inform the selection of a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average. Additionally, considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players may also help in making a more informed decision.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that my chosen number in Round 2 was too high, resulting in a loss. It's possible that I overestimated the average chosen number and didn't adjust my selection accordingly. To mitigate this, I will devise a new plan to closely monitor the trend of average chosen numbers in each round and adjust my selection to be more in line with the actual average, rather than relying on a fixed number. This will involve a more dynamic and adaptive approach to my number selection.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in rounds 2 and 3, the chosen number was significantly higher than the winning number, resulting in a loss. This may indicate a tendency to overestimate the average chosen number and select a number that is too high. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to better understand the range of chosen numbers and adjust the selection strategy to be more conservative, aiming for a number closer to the lower end of the potential average range. This could increase the chances of selecting a number closer to 2/3 of the average and improve the likelihood of winning.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in a target number that is also higher than the winning number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve selecting a number that is closer to the average rather than aiming for a higher number, in order to increase the chances of being closest to the target number.

The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 1, the chosen number of 50 was the winning number, which was also the average number chosen by all players. This suggests that the player may have simply chosen the average number without considering the target number. To mitigate this failure, the new plan should focus on calculating the target number (2/3 of the average) and strategically selecting a number that is closest to this target, rather than just choosing the average number. This will require a more thoughtful and strategic approach to decision-making in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the chosen number of 40 in Round 2 was not close enough to the target number of 25.67, resulting in a loss. One possible reason for this failure could be a lack of consideration for the average number chosen by other players. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could involve analyzing the historical data of past game rounds to identify patterns and trends in the average numbers chosen by other players, and using this information to make a more informed decision when selecting a number for future rounds.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the past game rounds, the chosen numbers were consistently higher than the target number, resulting in losses. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the strategy to select a number that is closer to the lower end of the range (0-100) to better align with the 2/3 average calculation. Additionally, considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and aiming for a more conservative estimate of the average could also improve the chances of success.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the past game rounds, the chosen numbers were consistently higher than the target number, resulting in losses.

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-Possible reason for failure: It appears that the chosen number of 50 was the same as the average number, resulting in a win. However, this may have been a lucky guess rather than a strategic decision.\n\nNew plan: To mitigate this, I will analyze the historical data from past game rounds to identify patterns and trends in the chosen numbers. I will then use this analysis to inform my decision-making process and select a number that is strategically aligned with the average and target number. This will increase my chances of winning based on informed reasoning rather than luck.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 45 was not as close to the target number of 25.67 as it needed to be in order to win. This may be due to a miscalculation or misjudgment of the average and target number. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could involve implementing a more precise calculation method for determining the target number and ensuring a better understanding of the relationship between the average and the target number. Additionally, considering the distribution of chosen numbers and adjusting the strategy accordingly could also improve the chances of selecting a winning number.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the last two rounds, the chosen number was significantly higher than the average, resulting in a target number that was also higher than the winning number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers in previous rounds to better understand the range of numbers being selected by other players. This analysis can then inform the selection of a number that is more likely to be closer to 2/3 of the average in future rounds. Additionally, considering the potential for outliers in the data and adjusting the chosen number accordingly may also improve the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the past game rounds, the chosen numbers were consistently higher than the average, resulting in a target number that was also higher than the winning number. To mitigate this failure, a new plan could involve adjusting the strategy to choose a number that is closer to the actual average, rather than consistently selecting a higher number. This could involve analyzing the previous rounds' average numbers and adjusting the chosen number accordingly to be closer to the average. Additionally, considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players could also help in making a more informed decision.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that my chosen number is consistently higher than the winning number. This may indicate that I am overestimating the average chosen by the other players. To mitigate this, I will adjust my strategy to choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of what I believe the average chosen by other players will be, rather than simply choosing a number I believe to be close to the average. This will involve analyzing the previous rounds more closely to better estimate the average chosen by other players.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in a target number that is also higher than the winning number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve selecting a number that is closer to the lower end of the possible range (0-100) to better align with the average and target number. Additionally, considering the distribution of chosen numbers in previous rounds may help in making a more informed decision for future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number, resulting in losses. This may indicate a tendency to overestimate the average chosen number and therefore select a number that is too high. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the strategy to select a number that is slightly lower than the perceived average, in order to better align with the target number. This could involve considering the distribution of chosen numbers and aiming for a more conservative estimate.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number, resulting in losses.

This may indicate a tendency to overestimate the average chosen number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the chosen number to be closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than aiming for a higher number. This could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the chosen numbers and adjusting the strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses. This may indicate a misunderstanding of the target number calculation. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve recalibrating the understanding of the target number calculation and adjusting the chosen number strategy to be closer to 2/3 of the average. This could involve selecting numbers that are more in line with the expected target number based on the average.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number, resulting in losses.

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-Possible reason for failure: It appears that the chosen number of 50 was the same as the average number, resulting in a win. However, this may have been a lucky guess rather than a strategic choice based on the target number calculation.\n\nNew plan: In future rounds, I will aim to strategically choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply matching the average. This will involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers and making a more informed decision based on the target number calculation.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the player's chosen number in Round 2 was not as close to the target number as in Round 1. This could be due to a lack of adjustment based on the average number chosen by all players. To mitigate this, the player should consider incorporating a strategy that takes into account the distribution of numbers chosen by other players in order to make a more informed decision for their own selection. This could involve analyzing past rounds to identify patterns and adjusting their chosen number accordingly.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 3, the chosen number of 40 was significantly higher than the target number of 26. This may indicate a miscalculation or misjudgment in predicting the average and target number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve refining the strategy for calculating the average and target number, possibly by incorporating a more systematic approach to analyzing the historical data and adjusting the chosen number accordingly. Additionally, considering the distribution of past chosen numbers and their proximity to the target number could also inform a more accurate selection in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen number by player_4 in Round 3 was significantly higher than the average, resulting in a loss.

However, this may have been a lucky guess rather than a strategic choice based on the target number calculation.\n\nNew plan: In future rounds, I will aim to strategically choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply matching the average. This will involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers and making a more informed decision based on the target number calculation.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the player's chosen number in Round 2 was not as close to the target number as in Round 1. This could be due to a lack of adjustment based on the average number chosen by all players. To mitigate this, the player should consider incorporating a strategy that takes into account the distribution of numbers chosen by other players in order to make a more informed decision for their own selection. This could involve analyzing past rounds to identify patterns and adjusting their chosen number accordingly.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 3, the chosen number of 40 was significantly higher than the target number of 26. This may indicate a miscalculation or misjudgment in predicting the average and target number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve refining the strategy for calculating the average and target number, possibly by incorporating a more systematic approach to analyzing the historical data and adjusting the chosen number accordingly. Additionally, considering the distribution of past chosen numbers and their proximity to the target number could also inform a more accurate selection in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen number by player_4 in Round 3 was significantly higher than the average, resulting in a loss. To mitigate this failure, player_4 should aim to better estimate the average of all chosen numbers and select a number closer to 2/3 of that average in future rounds. A high-level plan to achieve this could involve analyzing the previous rounds' average numbers and target numbers to better understand the pattern and make more accurate selections in the future.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the rounds where you lost, your chosen number was consistently higher than the winning number. This suggests that you may be overestimating the average chosen by the other players. To mitigate this, you could consider adjusting your strategy to choose a number that is slightly lower than your initial estimate of the average, in order to increase your chances of being closest to 2/3 of the actual average. This adjustment could help improve your performance in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_4 were consistently higher than the target number, resulting in losses.

The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 1, the winning number was the same as the average number chosen by all players. This suggests that the players may not have fully understood the game rules or may have simply chosen their own number without considering the average. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve providing clearer instructions and examples of how to strategically choose a number that is closest to 2/3 of the average, rather than just selecting a random number. Additionally, offering a brief tutorial or practice round before the official game could help ensure that all players understand the objective and how to achieve it.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 40 was not as close to the target number of 25.67 as it could have been. This may be due to a lack of consideration for the average number chosen by other players. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data of past rounds to identify patterns and trends in the chosen numbers, and using this information to make a more informed decision for future rounds. Additionally, considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and adjusting the chosen number accordingly could also improve the chances of success.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the first round, the chosen number of 50 was successful in winning the game, but in the subsequent rounds, the chosen numbers of 40 and 35 were not as successful. This could indicate that the chosen numbers were not as strategically aligned with the average and target number in the later rounds. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could involve analyzing the historical data of average numbers chosen and target numbers to better understand the distribution and trends, and then using this analysis to inform the selection of a number that is more strategically aligned with the average and target number in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_5 are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses in rounds 2 and 3. This suggests a possible overestimation of the average by player_5.

This suggests that the players may not have fully understood the game rules or may have simply chosen their own number without considering the average. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve providing clearer instructions and examples of how to strategically choose a number that is closest to 2/3 of the average, rather than just selecting a random number. Additionally, offering a brief tutorial or practice round before the official game could help ensure that all players understand the objective and how to achieve it.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 40 was not as close to the target number of 25.67 as it could have been. This may be due to a lack of consideration for the average number chosen by other players. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data of past rounds to identify patterns and trends in the chosen numbers, and using this information to make a more informed decision for future rounds. Additionally, considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and adjusting the chosen number accordingly could also improve the chances of success.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the first round, the chosen number of 50 was successful in winning the game, but in the subsequent rounds, the chosen numbers of 40 and 35 were not as successful. This could indicate that the chosen numbers were not as strategically aligned with the average and target number in the later rounds. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could involve analyzing the historical data of average numbers chosen and target numbers to better understand the distribution and trends, and then using this analysis to inform the selection of a number that is more strategically aligned with the average and target number in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_5 are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses in rounds 2 and 3. This suggests a possible overestimation of the average by player_5. To mitigate this, player_5 should aim to select a number closer to the lower end of the range in future rounds, and consider the distribution of numbers chosen by other players to make a more accurate estimation of the average. Additionally, player_5 could benefit from analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and adjust their strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_5 were consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses in rounds 2 and 3. This suggests a possible failure to accurately estimate the average and adjust the chosen number accordingly. To mitigate this, player_5 should consider using a more strategic approach to estimate the average and choose a number closer to 2/3 of that average in future rounds. This could involve analyzing the previous rounds' averages and adjusting the chosen number accordingly to improve the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in rounds 2 and 3, the chosen number was not as close to the target number as in rounds 1, 4, and 5. This could be due to a lack of adjustment based on the average number chosen by all players. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data of average numbers chosen in previous rounds and adjusting the chosen number based on this analysis to increase the likelihood of being closest to 2/3 of the average. This would involve a more strategic approach to decision-making based on past game results.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_5 are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses. To mitigate this, player_5 should aim to select a number closer to the average in future rounds. A new high-level plan could involve analyzing the historical data to better understand the distribution of chosen numbers and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly to be more in line with the average. Additionally, player_5 could consider implementing a more conservative approach by choosing numbers closer to the median of the range (50) to increase the chances of being closer to the target number.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it seems that the chosen numbers by player_5 are consistently higher than the winning numbers. This could indicate a tendency to overestimate the average and choose a number that is too high. To mitigate this, player_5 should consider adjusting their strategy to choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than consistently aiming for a higher number. This could involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers and adjusting their selection accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it seems that the chosen numbers by player_5 are consistently higher than the winning numbers. This may indicate a tendency to overestimate the average and target number. To mitigate this, player_5 should consider selecting numbers that are slightly lower than their initial estimate of the average, and aim to be closer to 2/3 of the average rather than exceeding it. This strategy may increase the chances of selecting a number closest to the target number and improve the overall performance in the game.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it seems that the chosen numbers by player_5 are consistently higher than the winning numbers.

This could involve using statistical methods or algorithms to make more informed decisions.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player consistently chose numbers that were too high or too close to the average, resulting in losses. To mitigate this, the player should aim to choose numbers that are more conservative and further away from the average, in order to increase the chances of being closest to 2/3 of the average. The new plan should focus on selecting numbers that are strategically lower or higher than the average, rather than trying to match it closely.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_5 are consistently higher than the winning numbers. This suggests a possible failure to accurately estimate the 2/3 of the average of all chosen numbers. To mitigate this, player_5 should consider adjusting their strategy to choose numbers that are closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than consistently selecting higher numbers. This could involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers in previous rounds and adjusting their selections accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player consistently chose numbers that were too high or too low compared to the average, resulting in frequent losses. To mitigate this, the player should consider adjusting their strategy to choose numbers closer to the 2/3 of the average, rather than simply selecting numbers they believe to be close to the average.

However, this may have been a lucky guess rather than a strategic choice based on the target number.\n\nNew plan: In future rounds, I will aim to choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply matching the average. This will involve analyzing the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and making a more informed decision based on the target number.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 40 was not as close to the target number of 25.67 as it could have been. This may be due to a lack of consideration for the average number chosen by other players. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could involve analyzing the historical data of past game rounds to identify patterns and trends in the chosen numbers, and using this information to make a more informed decision when selecting a number for future rounds. Additionally, considering the distribution of chosen numbers and adjusting the strategy accordingly may also help improve the chances of selecting a number closer to the target.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the first round, the chosen number of 50 was successful in winning the game, but in the subsequent rounds, the chosen numbers of 40 and 35 were not as successful. This could indicate that the initial strategy of choosing a number close to the average may not always be effective. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers in each round and adjusting the strategy to choose a number that is strategically positioned relative to the distribution, rather than just aiming to be close to the average. This could involve considering the spread of numbers chosen and strategically positioning the chosen number to maximize the chances of being closest to 2/3 of the average.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the first round, I was successful in choosing a number closest to the target. However, in the subsequent rounds, my chosen number was not as close to the target. This could be due to a lack of adjustment in my strategy based on the average numbers chosen by other players.

This indicates a lack of understanding of the game rules and the goal of choosing a number closest to 2/3 of the average.\n\nNew plan: To mitigate this failure, the new plan should focus on understanding the game rules and the goal of choosing a number closest to 2/3 of the average. This can be achieved by carefully analyzing the historical data from past game rounds, identifying patterns, and adjusting the strategy to choose a number that is more likely to be closest to the target number. Additionally, considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and making a more informed decision based on that analysis can also improve the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the player's strategy of consistently choosing the average number as their selection has resulted in two consecutive wins. However, this strategy may not be sustainable in the long run as it relies heavily on luck. To mitigate this, the player should consider a more diverse range of numbers and incorporate a mix of higher and lower values in their selections. This will increase the chances of being closer to the target number in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 3, the chosen number of 42 was significantly higher than the target number of 25.07. This may indicate a miscalculation or misjudgment in selecting a number close to 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this failure, the new plan could involve implementing a more precise calculation method or strategy for determining the optimal number to choose, such as considering the distribution of previous chosen numbers and adjusting accordingly. Additionally, incorporating a more systematic approach to decision-making based on historical data and trends could also help improve the chances of selecting a winning number in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in rounds 3 and 4, the chosen number was significantly higher than the target number, resulting in a loss. This may indicate a tendency to overestimate the average chosen number and select a number that is too high. To mitigate this, the new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to better understand the range of chosen numbers and adjust the selection strategy to be more conservative, aiming for a number closer to the lower end of the potential range. This could increase the chances of being closer to 2/3 of the average and improve the overall performance in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers by player_7 were consistently higher than the target number, resulting in losses.

However, this may have been a lucky guess rather than a strategic choice based on the target number.\n\nNew plan: In future rounds, I will aim to choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply matching the average. This will involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers and making a more informed decision based on the target number.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 40 was not close enough to the target number of 25.67, resulting in a loss. This may be due to a lack of consideration for the average number chosen by other players. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data of past rounds to better understand the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjust the selection accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average. This would involve a more strategic approach to decision-making based on the collective choices of all players.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the past rounds, the chosen numbers were consistently higher than the target number, resulting in losses. To mitigate this, a new plan could be to analyze the historical data to identify the average difference between the chosen numbers and the target number, and then adjust the chosen number accordingly to be closer to the target. Additionally, considering the distribution of chosen numbers and aiming for a more strategic approach in selecting a number that is more likely to be closest to the target could also improve the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers by player_8 are consistently higher than the target number. This may indicate a tendency to overestimate the average of all chosen numbers. To mitigate this, player_8 should consider selecting a number that is closer to the lower end of the range (0-100) to better align with the 2/3 of the average.

This suggests a possible overestimation of the average chosen numbers and miscalculation of the target number. To mitigate this, player_8 should consider selecting a number closer to the lower end of the range (0-100) to better align with the 2/3 average calculation. Additionally, player_8 should pay closer attention to the trend of the average chosen numbers in each round to make a more accurate estimation for their own selection.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_8 are consistently higher than the average of all numbers chosen by players.

The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-Possible reason for failure: The chosen number was the same as the average, indicating a lack of strategic thinking in selecting a number that would be closest to 2/3 of the average.\n\nNew plan: In future rounds, I will aim to select a number that is slightly lower than the average, to increase the likelihood of being closest to 2/3 of the average. I will also consider the distribution of numbers chosen by other players to inform my decision.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 45 was not as close to the target number of 25.67 as it needed to be in order to win. This may be due to a lack of consideration for the average number chosen by all players. To mitigate this failure, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data of past rounds to better understand the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjust the chosen number accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average. This would involve a more strategic approach to decision-making based on the collective choices of all players.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the last two rounds, the chosen number was significantly higher than the average, resulting in a loss. To mitigate this, the new plan could be to analyze the historical data of past rounds to better understand the distribution of chosen numbers and adjust the selection strategy accordingly. This could involve considering the range of numbers chosen by other players and aiming for a number closer to the average in order to increase the chances of being closest to 2/3 of the average.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the past game rounds, the chosen numbers were consistently higher than the target number, resulting in losses. This suggests that there may be a tendency to overestimate the average chosen number and select a number that is too high. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the strategy to select a number that is slightly lower than the perceived average, in order to increase the chances of being closest to 2/3 of the average. This could involve recalibrating the estimation process and considering the potential for other players to also select higher numbers.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses. This may indicate a tendency to overestimate the average and choose a number that is too high. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the strategy to choose a number that is closer to the actual average, rather than consistently aiming for a higher number. This could involve analyzing the historical averages and adjusting the chosen number accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers by player_9 are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses. To mitigate this, player_9 should aim to select a number closer to the average in future rounds. A new plan could involve analyzing the trend of chosen numbers in previous rounds and adjusting the selection strategy to be more in line with the average, increasing the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_9 are consistently higher than the winning numbers. This suggests a possible failure in accurately estimating the 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, player_9 should consider adjusting their chosen number to be closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than consistently overshooting it. A new plan could involve analyzing the historical average numbers chosen by all players and adjusting player_9's chosen number to be closer to 2/3 of that average. This would involve a more strategic approach to estimating the target number.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it seems that the chosen numbers by player_9 are consistently higher than the winning numbers. This indicates a possible overestimation of the average chosen numbers and the target number. To mitigate this, player_9 should consider selecting a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average rather than aiming for a higher number. A new plan could involve analyzing the trend of the average chosen numbers and adjusting the selection strategy to be more conservative and closer to the 2/3 target. This could involve choosing numbers that are slightly lower than the perceived average.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the early rounds, the chosen number was consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify the average range of chosen numbers and adjust the selection strategy accordingly. Additionally, considering the distribution of chosen numbers and aiming for a number closer to the average could improve the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it seems that the chosen numbers by player_9 are consistently higher than the winning numbers. This indicates a possible overestimation of the average chosen numbers and the target number. To mitigate this, player_9 should consider selecting a number closer to the lower end of the range (0-100) to better align with the actual average and target number. Additionally, player_9 should analyze the historical data to identify any patterns or trends in the chosen numbers to inform their future selections.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the chosen numbers by player_9 are consistently higher than the winning numbers in each round. This suggests that player_9 may be overestimating the average chosen by other players. To mitigate this, player_9 should consider selecting a number that is closer to the lower end of the possible range (0-100) to better align with the actual average and target number. Additionally, player_9 should analyze the historical data to understand the distribution of chosen numbers and adjust their strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it seems that the chosen numbers by player_9 were consistently higher than the winning numbers in most rounds, leading to repeated losses. To mitigate this, player_9 should consider selecting numbers closer to the lower end of the range, as the average tends to be lower than expected. Additionally, player_9 should analyze the historical data to identify any patterns or trends in the average numbers chosen by all players and adjust their strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_9 are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses in most rounds.
