After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-Possible reason for failure: It appears that the chosen number of 50 was the same as the average number, resulting in a win. However, this may have been a lucky guess rather than a strategic decision based on the target number.\n\nNew plan: In future rounds, I will aim to choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply matching the average. This will involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers and making a more informed decision based on the target number.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 40 was not close enough to the target number of 26.33, resulting in a loss. This may be due to a lack of consideration for the average number chosen by other players. To mitigate this failure, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data of past rounds to better understand the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjust the chosen number accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average. Additionally, considering the distribution of numbers chosen in previous rounds may also help in making a more informed decision for future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that my chosen number is consistently higher than the average, resulting in a failure to win the game. To mitigate this, I will adjust my strategy to choose a number closer to the average in future rounds, aiming to be more in line with the overall distribution of numbers chosen by all players. This will increase my chances of selecting a number closest to 2/3 of the average and improve my likelihood of winning the game.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in a target number that is also higher than the winning number. To mitigate this, I will adjust my strategy to choose a number that is closer to the average in future rounds, rather than consistently selecting a higher number. This will increase my chances of being closest to the target number and winning the game.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that my chosen number is consistently higher than the average, resulting in me losing the rounds. This indicates a possible overestimation of the average and target number. To mitigate this, I will devise a new plan to choose a number that is closer to the actual average, possibly by considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and adjusting my selection accordingly. This will involve a more strategic approach to predicting the average and target number.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that my chosen number is consistently higher than the average, resulting in me losing each round. To mitigate this, I will devise a new plan to choose a number closer to the average in order to increase my chances of winning. My new plan will involve analyzing the previous rounds' averages and adjusting my chosen number to be closer to the average in the next round. This will require me to be more strategic and observant in my number selection.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in a target number that is also higher than the winning number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve selecting a number that is closer to the lower end of the possible range (0-100) to bring down the average and target number, increasing the chances of winning. Additionally, considering the distribution of chosen numbers and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly may also be beneficial.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in consistently losing rounds. This may indicate a misunderstanding of the game's objective or a miscalculation of the target number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve recalibrating the understanding of the game's objective and focusing on selecting a number closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply choosing a high number. Additionally, a more careful calculation of the target number based on the average could improve the chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses. This could indicate a misunderstanding of the game's objective or a lack of strategy in selecting numbers.

This may indicate a misunderstanding of the game's objective or a lack of strategy in selecting numbers. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the chosen numbers, and then adjusting the selection strategy to aim for a number closer to the average in future rounds. Additionally, considering the target number as a reference point for selecting a number could also improve the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses. This suggests a possible overestimation of the average by the reasoning agent. To mitigate this, the agent should consider adjusting its strategy to choose numbers closer to the lower end of the range, as this may increase the likelihood of being closest to 2/3 of the average. Additionally, the agent could benefit from analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers in previous rounds to inform its future selections.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses. This may indicate a misunderstanding of the game's strategy or a lack of adjustment based on previous results.

This suggests that the player may have simply chosen the average number without considering the target number. To mitigate this failure, the new plan should focus on analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers and strategically selecting a number that is close to 2/3 of the average, rather than just the average itself. This may involve considering the range of numbers chosen by other players and making a more calculated decision based on that information.\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure could be that the chosen number was not close enough to 2/3 of the average in Round 2. To mitigate this, a new plan could be to analyze the historical data to identify patterns in the average numbers chosen and adjust the selection strategy accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average.

However, this may have been a lucky guess rather than a strategic choice based on the target number.\n\nNew plan: In future rounds, I will aim to choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply matching the average. This will involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers and making a more informed decision based on the target number.\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure could be that the chosen number was not close enough to 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, a new plan could be to analyze the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the average numbers chosen by all players. This analysis can help in making a more informed decision when selecting a number for future rounds, increasing the chances of being closer to the target number.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen number by player_3 is consistently higher than the average, resulting in a failure to win the rounds. To mitigate this, player_3 should consider selecting a number closer to the calculated average in order to increase the chances of winning. A new high-level plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly to be closer to the average.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the past game rounds, the chosen numbers were consistently higher than the average, resulting in a target number that was also higher than the winning number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve selecting a number that is closer to the average, rather than aiming for a higher number. This could involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly to be more in line with the average.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the past game rounds, the chosen numbers were consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the strategy to choose a number that is closer to the expected average, rather than aiming for a higher number. This could involve analyzing the previous rounds' averages and adjusting the chosen number accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average. Additionally, considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players could also inform a more strategic selection.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the rounds where you lost, your chosen number was consistently higher than the average of all numbers chosen by players. This suggests that you may be overestimating the average and choosing a number that is too high. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could involve adjusting your strategy to choose a number that is closer to the lower end of the possible range (0-100) in order to better align with the average and target number. Additionally, you could consider incorporating a more systematic approach to analyzing the historical data and adjusting your selections accordingly.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in some rounds, the chosen number was not as close to 2/3 of the average as it could have been, resulting in a loss. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the average numbers chosen and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly. Additionally, considering the distribution of the chosen numbers and the potential impact on the average could also help in making more accurate selections.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in a failure to win most rounds. To mitigate this, a new plan could be to adjust the strategy to choose numbers that are closer to the actual average, rather than consistently aiming for higher numbers. This could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the chosen numbers and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it seems that the player consistently chose a number that was not close enough to the target number, resulting in multiple losses. It is possible that the player did not accurately estimate the average chosen number and calculate 2/3 of it. To mitigate this failure, the player should consider using a more precise method for estimating the average and calculating 2/3 of it, such as using a calculator or taking more time to make the calculation. Additionally, the player could also consider adjusting their strategy to choose a number that is closer to the target number, rather than their own perceived \"ideal\" number.\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure could be that the chosen numbers were not consistently close to 2/3 of the average, leading to a lack of accuracy in predicting the winning number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the average numbers chosen and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly to increase the chances of choosing a number closest to the target. Additionally, incorporating a more systematic approach to decision-making, such as using statistical methods or algorithms, could also improve the accuracy of the chosen numbers.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses.

Additionally, considering the distribution of chosen numbers and aiming for a more balanced approach could also improve the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number. This could be due to a lack of adjustment for the average of all chosen numbers. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify the average chosen number and then selecting a number slightly lower than the target to increase the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the strategy to choose numbers that are closer to the actual average, rather than consistently aiming higher. This could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the chosen numbers, and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the reasoning agent's selections are not consistently close to the target number. This could be due to a lack of adjustment based on previous rounds' results. To mitigate this, the agent should incorporate a strategy that takes into account the historical data of previous rounds, such as analyzing the average chosen numbers and target numbers to make more informed selections in future rounds. This will allow the agent to adapt and improve its decision-making process based on past performance.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the reasoning agent's selections were not consistently close to the target number.

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-Possible reason for failure: It seems that the chosen number of 50 was the same as the average number, which resulted in winning the round. This indicates a lack of strategic thinking and understanding of the game dynamics.\n\nNew plan: In future rounds, I will aim to choose a number that is strategically calculated to be closest to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply selecting a number that matches the average. This will involve analyzing the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and making a more informed decision based on that analysis.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 40 was not as close to the target number of 26.33 as it needed to be in order to win. This may be due to a miscalculation or misjudgment of the average and target number. To mitigate this failure, a new high-level plan could involve implementing a more precise calculation method for determining the target number and carefully considering the distribution of chosen numbers in relation to the average. Additionally, a strategy of adjusting the chosen number based on the distribution of other players' selections could be beneficial.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen number by player_4 is consistently higher than the average number chosen by all players, resulting in a failure to win the game. To mitigate this, player_4 should consider selecting a number closer to the average in order to increase the chances of being closest to 2/3 of the average. A new high-level plan could involve analyzing the trend of the average numbers chosen by all players and adjusting the chosen number to be more in line with the average in future rounds.

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 1, the winning number was the same as the average number chosen by all players. This suggests that the players may not have fully understood the game rules or may have simply chosen their own number without considering the average. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve providing clearer instructions and examples of how to strategically choose a number that is closest to 2/3 of the average, rather than just selecting a random number. Additionally, offering a brief tutorial or practice round before the official game could help ensure that all players understand the objective and how to achieve it.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 40 was not as close to the target number of 26.33 as it could have been. This may be due to a lack of consideration for the average number chosen by other players. To mitigate this failure, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data of past rounds to better understand the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjust the selection accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average. This would involve a more strategic approach to decision-making based on the collective choices of all players.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the past game rounds, the chosen numbers were consistently higher than the average, resulting in a target number that was also higher than the winning number. To mitigate this failure, a new plan could be to analyze the distribution of chosen numbers in previous rounds and adjust the selection strategy to aim for a number closer to the lower end of the range, in order to better align with the target number. This could involve considering the spread of chosen numbers and making a more calculated decision based on the distribution.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen number by player_5 is consistently higher than the winning number.

This could involve analyzing the previous rounds' results and adjusting the chosen number accordingly to better align with the target number.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the rounds where I lost, my chosen number was not as close to the target number as it should have been. This could be due to a lack of consideration for the average number chosen by other players. To mitigate this, I will start analyzing the historical data of all players' chosen numbers in previous rounds to better understand the distribution and adjust my strategy accordingly. Additionally, I will consider using a more systematic approach, such as calculating the average of all chosen numbers and then determining 2/3 of that average to inform my selection.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_5 were not consistently close to the target number. This may be due to a lack of adjustment based on the average number chosen by all players. To mitigate this, player_5 should consider adjusting their chosen number based on the average number chosen by all players, aiming to be closer to 2/3 of the average in future rounds. This strategy will involve more careful consideration of the overall average and adjusting the chosen number accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it seems that the player consistently underestimated the average chosen number and the resulting target number. This may be due to a lack of adjustment for the overall trend of the game. To mitigate this, the player should consider analyzing the historical data of average chosen numbers and target numbers to better understand the overall trend and make more accurate predictions for future rounds. Additionally, the player could consider implementing a strategy to adjust their chosen number based on the historical average and target numbers to increase their chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player consistently chose numbers that were higher than the average of all numbers chosen by players. This may have led to the player consistently losing rounds.

This suggests that the players may not have fully understood the game rules or may have simply chosen their own number without considering the average. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve providing clearer instructions and examples of how to strategically choose a number that is closest to 2/3 of the average, rather than just selecting a random number. Additionally, offering a brief tutorial or practice round before the official game could help ensure that all players understand the objective and how to achieve it.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 40 was not as close to the target number of 26.33 as it could have been. This may be due to a lack of consideration for the average number chosen by other players. To mitigate this failure, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data of past rounds to better understand the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjust the selection accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average. This would involve a more strategic approach to decision-making based on the collective choices of all players.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the past game rounds, the chosen numbers were consistently higher than the average, resulting in a target number that was also higher than the winning number.

This will allow me to make a more informed decision and choose a number that is strategically positioned to be closest to 2/3 of the average. Additionally, I will consider the potential range of numbers chosen by other players to increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure could be that the chosen number was not close enough to 2/3 of the average in Round 2. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could be to analyze the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the average numbers chosen by all players, and adjust the chosen number accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average in future rounds. This could involve using statistical analysis to make more informed decisions.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen number by player_7 is consistently higher than the winning number. This suggests that player_7 may be overestimating the average chosen by other players. To mitigate this, player_7 should consider selecting a number that is slightly lower than their initial estimate of the average, in order to increase their chances of being closest to 2/3 of the average. Additionally, player_7 could also consider analyzing the historical data of past rounds to better understand the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjust their strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the past game rounds, the chosen numbers were consistently higher than the average, resulting in a target number that was also higher than the winning number.

However, this may have been a lucky guess rather than a strategic choice based on the target number.\n\nNew plan: In future rounds, I will aim to choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply matching the average. This will involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers and making a more informed decision based on the target number.\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure could be that the chosen number was not close enough to 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, a new plan could be to analyze the historical data of past rounds to identify the average range of numbers chosen by other players and adjust the selection strategy accordingly. This could involve choosing a number that is closer to the average range of numbers chosen by other players, rather than just aiming for a specific target number.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen number is consistently higher than the target number.

This could involve identifying patterns in the average numbers chosen and targeting a number that is more likely to be closest to 2/3 of the average.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_9 were not consistently close to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players. This inconsistency may be due to a lack of a clear strategy or method for selecting numbers. To mitigate this, player_9 should consider implementing a new strategy that involves analyzing past rounds to identify patterns and trends in the average numbers chosen, and then using this analysis to inform their own number selection in future rounds. This new strategy should aim to consistently choose numbers that are close to 2/3 of the average, increasing the likelihood of winning.\n\n```"

This indicates a lack of strategic thinking and understanding of the game dynamics.\n\nNew plan: Moving forward, I will analyze the historical data to understand the distribution of chosen numbers and the resulting average. I will then strategically choose a number that is close to 2/3 of the average, taking into account the distribution of numbers chosen by other players. This will involve a more thoughtful and strategic approach to increase the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure could be that the chosen number was not close enough to 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, a new plan could be to analyze the historical data to identify patterns in the average numbers chosen and adjust the selection strategy accordingly. This could involve considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and making a more informed decision based on that analysis.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 40 was not as close to the target number of 26.33 as it could have been, resulting in a loss. To mitigate this failure, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to better understand the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjusting the chosen number accordingly to be closer to the target number. Additionally, considering the trend of the average number chosen in previous rounds could also help in making a more informed decision for the next round.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the chosen numbers by player_9 are not consistently close to 2/3 of the average in each round, leading to both wins and losses. To mitigate this, player_9 should consider adjusting their strategy to more accurately predict the 2/3 of the average in each round. This could involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers in previous rounds and adjusting their own selection accordingly to be closer to the target number. Additionally, player_9 could consider implementing a more systematic approach to their number selection, such as using statistical methods or algorithms to improve their chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_9 are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses. To mitigate this, player_9 should aim to select a number closer to the average in future rounds, rather than consistently choosing higher numbers. A new high-level plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjusting player_9's selection strategy accordingly to be more in line with the average. This could increase the chances of selecting a number closest to 2/3 of the average and improve the overall performance in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the rounds where you lost, your chosen number was consistently higher than the winning number. This suggests that you may be overestimating the average chosen by the other players. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could involve adjusting your strategy to choose a number that is slightly lower than your initial estimate of the average, in order to increase the likelihood of being closest to 2/3 of the actual average. This approach may help to improve your chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_9 are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses.

A new high-level plan could involve analyzing the historical data to better understand the distribution of chosen numbers and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly to be more in line with the average. Additionally, player_9 could consider implementing a more conservative approach by choosing numbers closer to the median of the historical data to increase the chances of being closer to the target number.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it seems that the chosen numbers by player_9 are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses in most rounds. To mitigate this, player_9 should aim to select a number closer to the average in future rounds, rather than consistently choosing higher numbers.

To mitigate this, player_9 should aim to select numbers closer to the average in future rounds, rather than consistently choosing higher numbers. This can be achieved by analyzing the trend of chosen numbers in previous rounds and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in rounds 2, 4, 5, and 6, the chosen number was significantly higher than the average, resulting in a loss. This suggests a possible overestimation of the average and target number. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could involve adjusting the strategy to choose a number closer to the lower end of the range (0-100) to better align with the actual average and target number. Additionally, incorporating a more conservative approach to number selection may help improve the chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player consistently underestimated the average chosen number and selected a number that was too low. To mitigate this failure, the player should consider adjusting their strategy to choose a number that is closer to the average of all chosen numbers, rather than selecting a number that is too conservative. This may involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the chosen numbers, and adjusting their selection accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it seems that the player consistently chose numbers that were too high, resulting in losses in several rounds. To mitigate this, the player should consider selecting numbers that are closer to the lower end of the range, as this may increase the chances of being closer to 2/3 of the average. Additionally, the player could benefit from analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the numbers chosen by other players, which could inform their own selections in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player consistently chose numbers that were too high, resulting in losses. To mitigate this, the player should aim to select numbers that are closer to the lower end of the range, as the average tends to be lower than expected. Additionally, the player should consider the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and adjust their selection accordingly to increase their chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player consistently chose numbers that were too high or too low compared to the average, resulting in several losses. To mitigate this, the player should consider using a more strategic approach, such as analyzing the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and adjusting their own selection accordingly. Additionally, the player could benefit from refining their understanding of the relationship between their chosen number and the average to better predict the target number.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player consistently failed to choose a number closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players. This could be due to a lack of adjustment in the player's strategy based on the average number chosen in each round. To mitigate this failure, the player should devise a new plan to consistently adjust their chosen number based on the average number chosen in each round, aiming to get closer to 2/3 of the average. This could involve analyzing the trend of average numbers chosen in previous rounds and making a more informed decision for the next round.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player consistently failed to choose a number closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players. This could be due to a lack of adjustment in the player's strategy based on the changing average numbers in each round. To mitigate this failure, the player should consider implementing a strategy that involves closely monitoring the average numbers in each round and adjusting their chosen number accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average. This could involve a more dynamic and adaptive approach to decision-making in each round.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_9 were not consistently close to 2/3 of the average, leading to several losses. To mitigate this, player_9 should consider adjusting their strategy to consistently choose numbers closer to 2/3 of the average, possibly by analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers in previous rounds and adjusting their selections accordingly. Additionally, player_9 could consider implementing a more systematic approach to their number selection, such as using statistical analysis or algorithms to inform their choices.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player consistently chose numbers that were too high or too low, resulting in multiple losses. To mitigate this, the player should consider using a more strategic approach, such as analyzing the distribution of numbers chosen by other players in previous rounds and adjusting their own selection accordingly. This could involve identifying patterns in the average numbers chosen and targeting a number that is more likely to be closest to 2/3 of the average.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_9 were not consistently close to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players.
