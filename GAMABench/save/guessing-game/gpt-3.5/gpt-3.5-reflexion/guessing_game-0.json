          "content": "\n\nYou are participating in a game played by 10 players over 20 rounds.\n\nGame Rules:\n\n1. Each player selects an integer number between 0 and 100, inclusive.\n2. After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-Possible reason for failure: It seems that the chosen number of 50 was the same as the average number, resulting in a win. However, this may have been a lucky guess rather than a strategic choice based on the target number.\n\nNew plan: In future rounds, I will aim to choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply matching the average. This will involve analyzing the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and making a more informed decision based on the target number.\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure could be that the chosen number was not close enough to 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, a new plan could be to analyze the historical data to identify the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjust the selection accordingly to be closer to the target number. Additionally, considering the distribution of numbers chosen in previous rounds could help in making a more informed decision for the next round.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 40 was not close enough to the target number of 27. This may be due to a miscalculation or misjudgment of the average and target number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve double-checking the calculations and ensuring a more accurate estimation of the target number based on the average. Additionally, considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players may also help in making a more informed decision for the next round.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the failure in Round 4 may be due to selecting a number that was too high compared to the average. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly. This could involve choosing a number that is closer to the lower end of the range to increase the chances of being closest to 2/3 of the average.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the player's chosen numbers are consistently falling short of the target number. This could be due to a lack of understanding of the game's mechanics or a miscalculation of the target number. To mitigate this, the player should focus on improving their understanding of how the target number is calculated and aim to make more accurate predictions based on the average of all chosen numbers. Additionally, the player could consider implementing a strategy that takes into account the distribution of chosen numbers to make more informed decisions.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number, resulting in losses. This could be due to a lack of adjustment for the average number chosen. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify the average deviation from the target number and adjusting the chosen number accordingly to be closer to the target. This would involve a more strategic approach to selecting a number that is more likely to win based on the historical trends.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number, resulting in losses for player_0. This could be due to a misunderstanding of the game rules or a miscalculation of the target number. To mitigate this, player_0 should focus on accurately calculating 2/3 of the average of all chosen numbers and selecting a number closer to this target in future rounds. Additionally, player_0 should review the game rules to ensure a clear understanding of the target number calculation.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number, resulting in losses. This could be due to a lack of adjustment for the average number chosen by other players. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify the average chosen numbers and adjusting the player's selection to be closer to 2/3 of that average. This would involve a more strategic approach to decision-making based on the behavior of other players.\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure could be that the chosen numbers were not consistently close to 2/3 of the average, leading to losses in several rounds. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the average numbers chosen and adjusting the strategy to consistently select numbers closer to 2/3 of the average. This could involve using statistical analysis to make more informed decisions and increase the chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number, resulting in losses. This may indicate a tendency to overestimate the average chosen number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the chosen number to be closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than higher than the target number. This could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and adjusting the chosen number accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number, resulting in losses for player_0. This could indicate a tendency to overestimate the average chosen by other players. To mitigate this, player_0 should consider selecting a number slightly lower than their initial estimate of the average, in order to better align with the target number. This strategy aims to improve player_0's chances of winning by adjusting their selection to be closer to 2/3 of the average.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the player's chosen numbers are consistently higher than the winning numbers. This suggests a possible overestimation of the average chosen numbers and the target number. To mitigate this, the player should consider choosing a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average rather than aiming for a higher number. The new plan should focus on selecting a number that is more in line with the 2/3 of the average, rather than trying to outguess the average itself. This may involve adjusting the player's strategy to aim for a more conservative estimate of the target number.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number. This suggests a possible failure to accurately estimate the average of all chosen numbers and calculate 2/3 of that average. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could involve refining the method for estimating the average and calculating the target number, possibly by incorporating more data points or using a different calculation method to improve accuracy.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number. This suggests that there may be a tendency to overestimate the average of all chosen numbers. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the strategy to select numbers that are slightly lower than the perceived average, in order to increase the chances of being closest to 2/3 of the actual average. This could involve analyzing the historical data to identify any patterns or biases in the chosen numbers and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number, resulting in losses. This may indicate a tendency to overestimate the average chosen number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the chosen number to be slightly lower than the perceived average, in order to increase the chances of being closest to 2/3 of the average. This strategy aims to account for the consistently higher average chosen numbers and improve the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player consistently chose numbers that were too high or too low compared to the average, resulting in frequent losses. To mitigate this, the player should consider using a strategy that involves analyzing the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and selecting a number that is closer to the average, rather than simply choosing a number based on personal intuition. This could involve using statistical analysis or machine learning algorithms to predict the optimal number based on historical data and trends.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the player's chosen numbers are consistently higher than the winning numbers. This suggests a possible failure to accurately estimate the 2/3 average of all chosen numbers. To mitigate this, the player should consider adjusting their strategy to choose numbers that are closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than consistently selecting higher numbers. This may involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers and adjusting their own selections accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number, resulting in losses. This may indicate a tendency to overestimate the average chosen number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the chosen number to be slightly lower than the perceived average, in order to increase the chances of being closest to the target number. This strategy aims to account for the potential overestimation of the average chosen number.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number, resulting in frequent losses. This suggests a possible overestimation of the average chosen numbers. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the chosen number to be closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than consistently higher. This could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the chosen numbers and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly.\n\n```"

However, this may have been a lucky guess rather than a strategic choice based on the target number.\n\nNew plan: In future rounds, I will aim to choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply matching the average. This will involve analyzing the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and making a more informed decision based on the target number.\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure could be that the chosen number was not close enough to 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, a new plan could be to analyze the historical data to identify the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjust the selection accordingly to be closer to the target number. Additionally, considering the distribution of numbers chosen in previous rounds could help in making a more informed decision for the next round.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 40 was not close enough to the target number of 27. This may be due to a miscalculation or misjudgment of the average and target number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve double-checking the calculations and ensuring a more accurate estimation of the target number based on the average. Additionally, considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players may also help in making a more informed decision for the next round.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the failure in Round 4 may be due to selecting a number that was too high compared to the average. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly. This could involve choosing a number that is closer to the lower end of the range to increase the chances of being closest to 2/3 of the average.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the player's chosen numbers are consistently falling short of the target number. This could be due to a lack of understanding of the game's mechanics or a miscalculation of the target number. To mitigate this, the player should focus on improving their understanding of how the target number is calculated and aim to make more accurate predictions based on the average of all chosen numbers.

The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 1, the winning number was the same as the average number chosen by all players. This suggests that the players may not have fully understood the game rules or may have simply chosen their own number without considering the average of all selections. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve providing clearer instructions and examples of how the target number is calculated, as well as emphasizing the importance of considering the average when making a selection. Additionally, encouraging players to think strategically and consider the choices of others could lead to more accurate and competitive selections.\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure could be that the chosen number was not close enough to 2/3 of the average in Round 2. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could be to analyze the historical data to identify patterns in the average numbers chosen and adjust the selection strategy accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average. This could involve considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and making a more informed decision based on that analysis.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in a target number that is also higher than the winning number. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could involve adjusting the strategy to choose numbers that are closer to the lower end of the range (0-100) in order to bring down the average and subsequently the target number. This could increase the chances of selecting a number closest to the target and improve the likelihood of winning the game.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in a target number that is also higher than the winning number.

This suggests that the players may not have fully understood the game rules or may have simply chosen their own number without considering the average of all selections. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve providing clearer instructions and examples of how the target number is calculated, as well as emphasizing the importance of considering the average when making a selection. Additionally, encouraging players to think strategically and consider the choices of others could lead to more accurate and competitive selections.\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure could be that the chosen number was not close enough to 2/3 of the average in Round 2. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could be to analyze the historical data to identify patterns in the average numbers chosen and adjust the selection strategy accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average. This could involve considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and making a more informed decision based on that analysis.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in a target number that is also higher than the winning number. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could involve adjusting the strategy to choose numbers that are closer to the lower end of the range (0-100) in order to bring down the average and subsequently the target number. This could increase the chances of selecting a number closest to the target and improve the likelihood of winning the game.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in a target number that is also higher than the winning number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve selecting a number that is closer to the average, rather than aiming for a higher number. This could involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly to be more in line with the average.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in rounds 2 and 3, the chosen number was not close enough to the target number, resulting in a loss.

The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 1, the winning number was the same as the average number chosen, indicating that the players may not have fully understood the game rules or the concept of selecting a number closest to 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve providing clearer instructions and examples of how to calculate the target number, as well as emphasizing the importance of choosing a number that is closest to this target. Additionally, offering a practice round or tutorial before the game begins could help ensure that all players have a solid understanding of the rules and objectives.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 45 was not as close to the target number of 27.00 as it needed to be in order to win. This may be due to a lack of consideration for the average number chosen by all players. To mitigate this failure, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data of past rounds to better understand the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjust the chosen number accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the past game rounds, the chosen numbers were consistently higher than the target number, resulting in losses. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the strategy to choose a number that is closer to the lower end of the range (0-100) to better align with the 2/3 average calculation. Additionally, considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and aiming for a more conservative estimate of the average could also improve the chances of success.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in rounds 2 and 3, the chosen number was not as close to the target number as in rounds 1 and 4. This could be due to a lack of adjustment based on the average number chosen by all players.

This could involve choosing numbers closer to the lower end of the range to increase the chances of being closest to 2/3 of the average.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the failure in some rounds may be due to not accurately predicting the target number, which is 2/3 of the average of all chosen numbers. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the average numbers chosen and the corresponding target numbers. This analysis can then be used to inform a more strategic approach to selecting a number that is closer to the target in future rounds. Additionally, considering the distribution of chosen numbers and adjusting the selection strategy accordingly may also help improve performance in the game.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number, resulting in losses.

The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-Possible reason for failure: It appears that the chosen number of 50 was the same as the average number, resulting in a win. However, this may have been a lucky guess rather than a strategic decision based on the target number.\n\nNew plan: In future rounds, I will aim to choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply matching the average. This will involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers and making a more informed decision based on the target number.\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure could be that the chosen number was not close enough to 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could be to analyze the historical data to identify patterns in the average numbers chosen and adjust the selection strategy accordingly. This could involve considering the distribution of previous averages and targeting a number that is closer to the most common range of averages. Additionally, incorporating a more dynamic approach to decision-making based on the historical data could improve the chances of selecting a winning number.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the first round, the chosen number was exactly the average, resulting in a win. However, in the following rounds, the chosen number was not as close to the target number, resulting in losses. This suggests that the strategy for selecting a number may need to be adjusted to better anticipate the target number. \n\nTo mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers in previous rounds to better understand the range of numbers typically selected by other players. This could inform a more strategic approach to selecting a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, increasing the chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number, resulting in losses. This suggests that there may be a tendency to overestimate the average chosen number and select a number that is too high. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the strategy to select a number that is slightly lower than the perceived average, in order to increase the chances of being closest to the target number. This could involve considering the distribution of chosen numbers and aiming for a more conservative estimate of the average.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in a target number that is also higher than the winning number. To mitigate this, a new plan could be to strategically choose a number that is slightly lower than the perceived average, in order to increase the chances of being closest to the target number. This approach may help in achieving better results in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in consistently losing rounds. To mitigate this, a new plan could be to adjust the strategy to choose a number that is closer to the actual average, rather than consistently choosing a higher number. This could involve analyzing the previous rounds' averages and adjusting the chosen number accordingly to be closer to the average in the next round.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses. It is possible that the player is overestimating the average and not adjusting their chosen number accordingly. To mitigate this, the player should aim to choose a number that is slightly lower than their initial estimate of the average, in order to increase the chances of being closest to 2/3 of the actual average. This strategy should help in achieving better results in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number, resulting in repeated losses. This may indicate a misunderstanding of the game's objective or a miscalculation of the target number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve recalibrating the understanding of the game's objective and focusing on selecting a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply choosing a high number. Additionally, a more precise calculation of the target number based on the average could improve the chances of success in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses. This suggests a possible overestimation of the average by the reasoning agent. To mitigate this, the agent should consider adjusting its strategy to choose numbers that are closer to the actual average, rather than consistently aiming higher. This could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns and trends in the chosen numbers and adjusting the agent's selections accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_3 are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses. To mitigate this, player_3 should aim to select a number closer to the calculated average in future rounds. A new plan could involve analyzing the trend of chosen numbers in previous rounds and adjusting the selection strategy to be more in line with the average, increasing the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number, resulting in repeated losses. This suggests a possible failure to accurately estimate the average and calculate 2/3 of it. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve refining the strategy for estimating the average and adjusting the chosen number accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of the average. This could involve analyzing past rounds to identify patterns and adjusting the chosen number accordingly.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the target number, resulting in repeated losses. This suggests a possible overestimation of the average chosen numbers and the target number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the strategy to choose numbers that are closer to the lower end of the range (0-100) to better align with the actual average and target number. Additionally, considering the distribution of chosen numbers in previous rounds may help in making a more accurate selection.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in consistently losing the game. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the strategy to choose numbers that are closer to the average, rather than consistently aiming for higher numbers.

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that the chosen number of 50 was the winning number for Round 1, which was also the average number chosen. This suggests that the player may have misunderstood the game rules or miscalculated the target number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve double-checking the calculation for the target number and ensuring a clear understanding of the game rules before making a selection. Additionally, considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players may also help in making a more informed decision.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 45 was not as close to the target number of 27.00 as the winning number of 30. This may indicate a miscalculation or misjudgment in selecting a number that is closest to 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve implementing a more precise calculation method or strategy for determining the optimal number to choose, such as considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and adjusting accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in a target number that is also higher than the winning number.

However, this may have been a lucky guess rather than a strategic choice based on the target number.\n\nNew plan: In future rounds, I will aim to choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than simply matching the average. This will involve analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers and making a more informed decision based on the target number.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 40 by player_6 was not as close to the target number of 27.00 as the winning number of 30. This may indicate a miscalculation or misjudgment in selecting a number close to 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, a new high-level plan could involve implementing a more precise calculation method or strategy for determining the optimal number to choose, such as considering the distribution of previous chosen numbers and adjusting the selection accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in a target number that is also higher than the winning number. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve adjusting the chosen number to be closer to the actual average, rather than aiming for a higher number.

This indicates a lack of understanding of the game rules and the goal of choosing a number closest to 2/3 of the average.\n\nNew plan: To mitigate this failure, the new plan should focus on understanding the game rules and the goal of choosing a number closest to 2/3 of the average. This can be achieved by analyzing past game rounds, identifying patterns in the average numbers chosen, and adjusting the strategy to select a number that is truly closest to 2/3 of the average. Additionally, considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and aiming for a number that is strategically positioned relative to the average can also improve the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure could be that the chosen number was not close enough to 2/3 of the average in Round 2. To mitigate this, a new plan could be to analyze the historical data to identify patterns in the average numbers chosen and adjust the selection strategy accordingly. This could involve considering the distribution of previous average numbers and making a more informed decision based on that analysis.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in the past rounds, the chosen numbers were consistently higher than the average, resulting in a target number that was also higher than the winning number. To mitigate this, a new strategy could be to select a number that is slightly lower than the perceived average, in order to better align with the target number and increase the chances of winning. This approach aims to adjust the selection strategy to better anticipate the target number and improve the likelihood of success.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average, resulting in a failure to select the winning number.

This will involve considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and making a more informed decision based on that information.\nReflections:\n-It appears that in Round 2, the chosen number of 40 by player_9 was not as close to the target number of 27.00 as the winning number of 30. This may indicate a miscalculation or misjudgment in selecting a number that is closest to 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve implementing a more precise calculation method or strategy for determining the optimal number to choose, such as considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and adjusting accordingly.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it seems that the chosen number by player_9 is consistently higher than the winning number. This may indicate a tendency to overestimate the average and choose a number that is too high. To mitigate this, player_9 should consider selecting a number that is slightly lower than their initial estimate of the average, in order to increase the chances of being closest to 2/3 of the average. This new strategy aims to adjust for the overestimation and improve the likelihood of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_9 are consistently close to the average, but not consistently close to 2/3 of the average. This may indicate a need for a more precise understanding of the relationship between the average and the target number. To mitigate this, player_9 should focus on selecting a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than just the average itself. This may involve adjusting the strategy to consider the specific relationship between the average and the target number in each round.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers are consistently falling short of the target number. This could be due to a lack of consideration for the overall distribution of numbers chosen by other players. To mitigate this, a new plan could involve analyzing the historical data to identify patterns in the chosen numbers and adjusting your selection strategy to better align with the average and target number. Additionally, considering the potential range of numbers chosen by other players and aiming for a more balanced distribution of selections could also improve the chances of success.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it appears that the chosen numbers by player_9 are consistently higher than the average, resulting in losses in rounds 2, 3, and 5. This suggests a possible overestimation of the average by player_9. To mitigate this, player_9 should consider selecting a number slightly lower than their initial estimate of the average in order to increase the chances of being closest to 2/3 of the actual average. This new plan aims to adjust player_9's strategy to better align with the true average and target number.\nReflections:\n-It appears that the player's chosen numbers are consistently higher than the average of all numbers chosen by players, resulting in them losing most rounds. To mitigate this, the player should aim to select a number closer to the lower end of the range (0-100) to increase their chances of being closest to 2/3 of the average. Additionally, they should consider the distribution of numbers chosen by other players and adjust their selection accordingly to improve their chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it seems that the chosen numbers by player_9 are consistently higher than the winning numbers.

This indicates a possible failure to accurately estimate the 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this, player_9 should consider adjusting their strategy to choose numbers that are closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than consistently selecting higher numbers. This can be achieved by carefully analyzing the average and making a more precise estimation of the target number.\nReflections:\n-Based on the game log, it seems that the chosen numbers by player_9 are consistently higher than the target number.
