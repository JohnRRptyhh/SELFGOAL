After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Experimentation: Since the game is not over yet, you could also experiment with slightly higher numbers in a few rounds to see if the trend changes or if other players start choosing higher numbers.\n - Target Range: Note the decreasing target number, with players winning by choosing 1 when the target was close to 0. Consider that the target might be slightly above 1 based on previous rounds.\n - Consider the Recent Winning Numbers: The number 1 has been a frequent winning number, which suggests that other players might also be choosing 1 or close to it. This could push the average higher.\n - Adaptive Strategy: Given the recent wins with 1, you could consider choosing a number slightly below 1 (e.g., 0.8 or 0.9) to hedge against the possibility of a continued decrease in the average. However, be cautious, as a sudden increase in the average could lead to a loss.\n - Target Calculation: If the average decreases, the target will also decrease proportionally. For example, if the average is 1.6, the target would be around 1.07.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

        "21": "Analyze Recent Outcomes: Notice that choosing 2 has resulted in losses in the last few rounds. This indicates that other players might be choosing 1 more frequently, causing the average to decrease. Thus, choosing a number slightly above 1 might be beneficial.",
        "22": "Risk Management: Balancing risk and reward, you might want to choose a number that is a bit higher than 1 but not too far from it, like 1.2, to minimize the risk of being too far from the target if the average stays low or increases slightly.",

        "36": "Adaptation: Given the recent trend, it might be beneficial to choose a number that is slightly different from the last few winning numbers (1) but still close to the target. A number like 0.5 or 1.5 could be a strategic choice.",
        "37": "Keep track of the game's progression: As the game nears its end, players might become more risk-averse or more daring, depending on their previous performance. This could impact the average and the target number.",

        "41": "Deviation from Target: The winning numbers have been deviating less and less from the target as the game progresses. This suggests that players are learning and refining their strategies.",
        "42": "Target Deviation: Since you've noticed an underestimation trend, consider choosing a number slightly above the calculated target. This could help you stay ahead of the curve if the trend persists.",
        "43": "Target Calculation: If the average decreases, the target will also decrease proportionally. For example, if the average is 1.6, the target would be around 1.07.",
        "44": "Risk Management: Since the winning number has consistently been 1, choosing 1 might seem like a safe bet. However, if too many players choose 1, the average could be pushed up, making a higher number closer to the target.",
        "45": "Maintain a Low Number: Given the recent history of low averages, it's important to continue choosing numbers close to 1, as this has been the winning number in many rounds.",
        "46": "Consider the Trend: The averages have been decreasing, but the last two rounds had the same average (1.6). This might indicate a potential reversal or stabilization of the trend. Be prepared for a slight increase or continued stability.",
        "47": "Avoid Overreacting: While it's tempting to adjust your choice based on the last round's outcome, remember that small differences can still lead to wins. Stick to a simple strategy and don't make drastic changes unless there's a clear indication of a shift in the game dynamics.",
        "48": "Trend Analysis: Notice that the average number chosen has been decreasing over time, from 32 in Round 1 to 1.8 in Round 17. This suggests that players are adjusting their numbers downward, possibly due to the game's progression and learning from previous rounds.",
        "49": "Target Number Awareness: You've won when choosing 1, which was close to the target number in several rounds. This indicates that choosing a number close to the lower bound (0) might be a safer strategy, especially when the average is low.",
        "50": "Learning from Others: Observe the behavior of other players and try to predict their choices. If they are also adjusting downward, you might want to choose even lower numbers in the future.",
        "51": "Anticipate the Next Move: As the game progresses, try to predict if the average will continue to decrease or if it might stabilize or increase slightly due to players adjusting their strategies.",
        "52": "Risk Tolerance: Assess the risk of choosing a number other than 1, considering that the winning number has been 1 for the last few rounds. Evaluate the potential for overcorrection by other players.",
        "53": "Variability: Take into account the consistency of the average at 1.6 and consider the possibility of a change in strategy by players.",
        "54": "Anticipate Others: Consider the potential actions of other players based on their observations of the trend. Evaluate the impact of their choices on the average and the target number.",
        "55": "Adaptability: Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on the actual average chosen in the round. Consider the implications of a higher or lower average on the target number.",
        "56": "Variability: Consider the possibility of other players choosing the same number, which could lead to a higher average and a different target. Try to choose a number that might result in a unique average, giving you a better chance at being closest to the target.",
        "57": "Target Estimation: Given the decreasing trend, estimate a lower average for the next round. However, be cautious as the trend might not continue indefinitely, and players might start to overcorrect.",
        "58": "Margin for Error: Given the game's nature, it's crucial to choose a number that allows for a small margin of error. This means selecting a number that can still be close to the target even if your estimate of the average is slightly off.",
        "59": "Overcorrection: Players might be overcorrecting their choices after seeing the previous round's average, which could lead to a slightly higher average than the immediate previous round.",
        "60": "Target Number Range: The target number has been consistently below 2, with a few exceptions. Players might aim for numbers around 1, considering the decreasing trend.",
        "61": "Avoiding Overlap: In Round 11, you chose 2, which was the target number, but you still lost. This could mean that multiple players chose the same number, causing a tie, and the winning number was the one with the next lowest deviation.",
        "62": "Tightening the Range: The game seems to be trending towards lower numbers. In the last few rounds, the average has been consistently below 2, and the winning number has been 1. This suggests that players are choosing very low numbers.",
        "63": "Overestimation Correction: As you've observed, players might be overshooting the target, which has resulted in the winning number remaining at 1 even when the target is lower. This indicates that players might need to choose even lower numbers to hit the target more accurately.",
        "64": "Variability Consideration: Keep in mind that the game is played by 10 players, and their choices might not always follow a consistent pattern. There could be occasional outliers that significantly affect the average, so be prepared to adapt to unexpected changes.",
        "65": "Learning from Past Mistakes: Analyze your own choices and the outcomes. You've won by choosing 1 in several rounds, but also lost when choosing 2. This suggests that choosing slightly above the target might be risky.",
        "66": "Risk Assessment: Since the game has been won mostly with 1, there might be a higher risk in choosing 2, as it has led to losses in some rounds. However, if you anticipate that others will choose 1, selecting 2 could be a strategic move to win if the average is slightly higher.",
        "67": "Adaptation: If you think players have learned from the recent rounds and might start choosing 0, consider choosing 1 to stay in the game. If you believe they will continue with 1, you might want to try 0 or 2 to differentiate your choice.",
        "68": "History Analysis: Look for patterns in the winning numbers and the average chosen numbers. If there's a clear pattern, use it to inform your decision.",
        "69": "Randomness: Consider the possibility that some players might choose randomly, which could affect the average and target.",
        "70": "Considering the Crowd: If other players are aware of the trend, they might also choose 1, which could push the average up slightly. In this case, choosing 0 might be a strategic move to be closer to the new target.",
        "71": "Variability: Introduce some variability in your choices to avoid being predictable. If you've been consistently choosing numbers close to the target, others might start to mimic or counter your strategy.",
        "72": "Monitor Others' Behavior: Pay attention to any changes in other players' choices. If you notice a shift, adjust your strategy accordingly.",
        "73": "Final Decision: Based on all these factors, make a calculated decision that takes into account the potential adaptations of other players, the current trend, and your own risk tolerance.",
        "74": "Risk-averse Strategy: Given the recent wins with a choice of 1, it might be tempting to stick with this number. However, as the target shifts, choosing 1 could become riskier. Consider selecting a number that is slightly higher but still close to the target to account for potential increases in the average.",
        "75": "Avoid Overconfidence: While you've won several rounds, don't become complacent. Each round is independent, and the winning strategy can change rapidly.",
        "76": "Estimate the Next Decrease: Based on the previous decreases, you can estimate that the average will decrease by around 1.4 for the next round. This would lead to an average of approximately 0.0 or 0.2.",
        "77": "Calculate the Target: 2/3 of this estimated average would be around 0.07 or 0.13.",
        "78": "Range Consideration: Since other players might also be observing the trend, they might choose numbers slightly above or below the target. Account for a range around the target, say, from 0.9 to 1.1.",
        "79": "Risk Assessment: Given the narrow range, consider the risk of choosing a number that is too close to the extremes. If everyone chooses a number near the target, a number slightly off-center might have a better chance of winning.",
        "80": "Consider the Winning Number: The winning number has been 1 for several rounds, indicating that players are converging around this number. This might be due to the simplicity and safety of choosing 1, as it's close to the target in recent rounds.",
        "81": "Anticipate Recursive Thinking: If you think other players are also considering recursive strategies, you might want to choose a number that is a few steps ahead in this sequence, such as 0.47 (2/3 of 0.71). However, be aware that this can lead to an infinite regress, and at some point, players might stop and choose a more stable number.",
        "82": "Balance Risk and Reward: Choosing a number too close to 0 could result in a large deviation if the average doesn't follow the expected trend. On the other hand, choosing a number closer to the previous averages could be safer but less likely to win if others have adapted their strategies.",
        "83": "Learning from Others: Observe the choices of other players to understand if they are also adjusting their strategies based on the game's progression.",
        "84": "Anticipating Future Trends: Predict whether the average will continue to decrease or stabilize. If it stabilizes, the winning number might start to approach the target more closely.",
        "85": "Account for Potential Correction: Players might start to correct their underestimation after observing a consistent pattern of winning numbers being below the target. This could lead to a slightly higher average in the next round.",
        "86": "Monitor Individual Strategies: If you have any information on other players' strategies, use it to refine your estimate. For example, if some players consistently choose numbers close to the extremes, their behavior might influence the average.",
        "87": "Stay Close to 1: Since 1 has been a frequent winning number, consider choosing a number close to 1, but be prepared for potential shifts in strategy from other players.",
        "88": "Monitor Changes: Keep an eye on any changes in the average number chosen. If the average starts to increase, it might be a sign that players are becoming more aggressive in their choices.",
        "89": "Analyze Recent Outliers: In Round 11, the average increased slightly to 2.0, which could indicate a change in other players' strategies. Monitor if this is a one-time fluctuation or a new trend.",
        "90": "Adapt to Recent Wins/Losses: You've won when choosing 1 in the last four rounds, but lost in Round 11 and 12. This might suggest that other players are also choosing 1, causing the average to stabilize or increase slightly. Adjust your choice accordingly.",
        "91": "Anticipate Others' Behavior: If players are aware of the decreasing trend, they might also be tightening their range. Be prepared for a more concentrated selection around the target.",
        "92": "Consider the Minimum and Maximum: While the averages have been low, remember that all players choose numbers between 0 and 100. As the averages approach these limits, it's less likely for them to decrease significantly. Be prepared for a potential increase or a more stable average.",
        "93": "Deviation Pattern: You've been choosing numbers that are generally higher than the winning number, except for Round 6, 7, and 8, where you chose the winning number. This indicates that you might be overestimating the target.",
        "94": "Buffer for Underestimation: Since you've been overestimating, consider choosing a number slightly below your calculated target to account for the possibility that others might also be underestimating.",
        "95": "Risk Management: Be cautious of choosing a number too close to zero, as it might lead to a situation where a small deviation from the target could result in a loss.",
        "96": "Set a Threshold: Determine a minimum number you're willing to choose, below which it might be too risky to go. This could be based on the assumption that the average cannot go below a certain point (e.g., 0).",
        "97": "Monitor the Game Progress: As the game progresses, you might start to see patterns in the behavior of other players. Use this information to inform your choices.",
        "98": "Avoiding Whole Numbers: Since the target is 2/3 of the average, choosing a number that could result in an average ending in a whole number might lead to a target that's difficult to predict. For example, if the average is 5, the target would be 3.33, which is less intuitive than if the average were 5.33, with a target of 3.55.",
        "99": "Consider Others' Awareness: Assume that other players have also noticed the decreasing trend. Some might choose numbers closer to the previous average (4.2) to counteract the decline, while others might choose lower numbers, expecting the trend to continue.",
        "100": "Target Range: Since the target number is 2/3 of the average, it's also decreasing. The winning numbers have been close to the target, so you should aim for a number that is slightly below the target to account for potential overshooting by other players.",
        "101": "Risk Mitigation: Given the recent wins with the number 1, there's a risk that other players might also choose 1, causing the average to increase slightly. You might want to consider a number slightly above 1 to account for this possibility.",
        "102": "History of Your Choices: Since you've been choosing 1 for the last few rounds, it might be beneficial to deviate slightly to avoid a potential tie, which would split the win.",
        "103": "Margin of Error: Consider a small buffer around the target to account for estimation errors or unexpected changes in other players' choices.",
        "104": "Adaptation: Given the small range of the target, consider choosing a number slightly above or below the expected target to hedge against other players' potential adjustments. For example, if you think the average will be closer to 2.4, you might choose a number slightly above 1.60, and if you think it will be closer to 2.8, you might choose a number slightly below 1.87.",
        "105": "Past Performance: Reflect on your previous choices and their proximity to the winning numbers. If you've consistently chosen numbers that are too high or too low, adjust your strategy accordingly.",
        "106": "Randomness Factor: Acknowledge that there might be some randomness in other players' choices, which could disrupt the trend. Be prepared to adapt your strategy in the next round based on the actual outcome.",
        "107": "Consider the Risk of Overcompensation: Players might be aware of the decreasing trend and could overcompensate, choosing numbers that are too low. Be cautious of this and try to find a balance between being too close to the previous round's average and too far from it.",
        "108": "Adapt to the Game Dynamics: Since the game has been going on for several rounds, players might be more strategic now. Observe if there are any patterns in the choices made by other players, and adjust your strategy accordingly.",
        "109": "Choose a Number Strategically: Based on the above analysis, choose a number that falls within the calculated target range but also takes into account the potential overcompensation or undercompensation by other players. A slightly conservative choice might be beneficial, as it could account for potential underestimation of the average.",
        "110": "Learning from Mistakes: Reflect on your previous choices and the outcomes. If you consistently overestimated or underestimated the average, adjust your strategy to correct for this bias.",
        "111": "Consider Others' Behavior: If you notice any patterns in other players' choices, factor that into your decision. For instance, if others seem to be consistently choosing numbers close to the target, you might want to choose a number that's slightly different to avoid a tie.",
        "112": "Continuing the Decreasing Trend: Given the pattern so far, it seems logical to assume that the average number chosen will continue to decrease. However, be cautious as this trend may not always hold true indefinitely.",
        "113": "Pattern Recognition: In Round 1, won by choosing the average. In Rounds 2-5, consistently chose numbers above the target. In Rounds 6-9, won by choosing numbers close to or equal to the target.",
        "114": "Track the Decreasing Trend: Observe that the average has been dropping by approximately 1.2 to 1.6 points per round. This suggests a roughly linear decrease.",
        "115": "Slight Overestimation: Since the game seems to be trending downward, consider slightly overestimating the target. This is because other players might also be adjusting their choices downward, potentially causing the average to dip below your prediction.",
        "116": "Consider the Lower Bound: Be mindful of the lower bound (0) and avoid choosing numbers that are too close to it, as the game seems to be approaching that limit.",
        "117": "Monitor Winning Numbers: Note that in some rounds, the winning number has been 1, even when the target was slightly higher. This indicates that other players might also be choosing 1, so you might want to consider this in your decision-making.",
        "118": "Target Estimation: In Rounds 2-5, consistently around 2-3 points above the target. In Rounds 6-9, closer to the target, winning in three out of four rounds.",
        "119": "Target Range: Given the decreasing trend, consider a range around the target number, taking into account the buffer for overestimation. For example, if the target is 0.80, you might choose a number between 0.65 and 0.95.",
        "120": "Game Dynamics: If you have any information on other players' strategies or if you've noticed any patterns in their choices, factor that into your decision-making.",
        "121": "Final Decision: Based on the above considerations, make a decision that feels like a reasonable compromise between the potential decrease in the average, the buffer for overestimation, and the risk of being too far from the target.",
        "122": "Adapt to the Game Progress: Since you've won the last two rounds with numbers close to the target, other players might adjust their strategies in response. Be prepared for potential changes in their behavior.",
        "123": "Avoiding Overcorrection: Reflect on your own choices and how they relate to the target. In Round 5, you chose 7, which was still above the target of 4.27. Be cautious not to overcorrect and choose a number that is too low.",
        "124": "Consider the Cluster Effect: Since the winning number has been 1 for several rounds, there might be a cluster of players choosing this number. You could choose a number slightly above or below 1 to avoid a tie or to exploit the potential overcorrection.",
        "125": "Target Bias: Given that the target is 2/3 of the average, it seems that choosing a number slightly below the estimated average has a higher chance of winning, as you experienced in Round 1 and Round 6.",
        "126": "Account for Overcorrection: Players might be overcorrecting their choices after losing, which could lead to a new pattern. For example, after Round 2, you and others might have chosen numbers lower than the actual target.",
        "127": "Adapt Your Strategy: Given the recent wins with numbers close to the lower bound, you might want to maintain a cautious approach, choosing a number slightly below the estimated average but not too close to 0 to avoid overcorrection.",
        "128": "Continuing Decrease: Expect a lower average number for Round 10, but consider that the decrease might be smaller than in previous rounds.",
        "129": "Target Range: Expect the target to decrease accordingly, but the decrease in the target might not be as steep as the decrease in the average due to the fractional calculation.",
        "130": "Learning from Past Wins: Choosing a number slightly above the calculated target might be a good strategy, especially if you anticipate others also choosing slightly higher numbers.",
        "131": "Calculate the Target: If the average is around 0.6 to 0.8, the target would be around 0.4 to 0.53. Choose a number that is slightly above this range, say 0.55, to account for potential overshooting by other players.",
        "132": "Anticipate the End Point: The game seems to be approaching an end where the average will be very close to zero. Given the current average of 1.2, it's unlikely that all players will choose a number significantly lower than 1 in the next round.",
        "133": "Estimate the Next Average: Given the trend and the potential for a smaller decrease or even a slight increase, you might consider an average in the range of 10-12 for the next round. This is a wider range than the initial suggestion (15-17) to account for the uncertainty in the rate of decrease and potential changes in player behavior.",
        "134": "Adapt to Unexpected Changes: Be prepared to adjust your strategy if the game dynamics change unexpectedly, such as if a large number of players suddenly choose a significantly higher or lower number.",
        "135": "Estimate the Average: Based on the previous round's average (1.2), it's reasonable to expect a similar or slightly lower average for Round 9. A conservative estimate could be around 1.0 or 0.9.",
        "136": "Estimate the Continuing Trend: Given the decreasing trend, you might assume that players will continue to choose lower numbers. However, be cautious as this trend may not persist indefinitely.",
        "137": "Consider the Range: Since the numbers are between 0 and 100, it's unlikely that players will choose extremely low numbers, especially if they've noticed the same trend.",
        "138": "Monitor Variability: If players start to diversify their strategies, the average might stabilize or fluctuate more. Keep track of this variability to adjust your strategy accordingly.",
        "139": "Consistency: Since there is only one round of data, it's difficult to identify consistent patterns. However, if this trend continues, it might indicate that players are selecting numbers around the average of the range (50) or slightly lower.",
        "140": "Predict the New Average: Based on the previous round's average (2.2), it's likely that players will choose even lower numbers. However, the decrease might slow down or stabilize due to the approaching lower bound. Estimate a new average, perhaps slightly above 0, but not too far from it.",
        "141": "Choose Below the Estimated Average: As a strategy, consider selecting a number slightly below the estimated average to account for the potential target being 2/3 of this new, lower average. However, don't go too far below, as this increases the risk of being too low.",
        "142": "Learn from Past Mistakes: Reflect on your previous choices and the outcomes. If you consistently chose above the target, consider adjusting downward. If you've been too low, consider a slight increase.",
        "143": "Trend Continuation or Reversal: While the trend has been consistently downward, it's crucial to consider whether this will continue or if a reversal or stabilization is more likely. Given the numbers have decreased significantly from 32 to 10.2, a reversal or stabilization might be imminent, as players might start choosing higher numbers to avoid going too low.",
        "144": "Risk Mitigation: Since the game has shown a high degree of volatility, consider choosing a number that is slightly below the estimated target to hedge against the possibility of a continued downward trend. However, don't go too low, as a reversal or stabilization could result in a higher winning number.",

        "147": "Assess the Trend: The average has been consistently decreasing. Players might now notice this pattern and adjust their choices, potentially selecting numbers closer to or above the average.",
        "148": "Adaptability: Be prepared to adjust your strategy if the game dynamics change unexpectedly. If the average continues to drop, it might indicate that players are still choosing lower numbers.",
        "149": "Target a Slightly Higher Number: Given the potential for strategy shifts, consider choosing a number slightly above the 2/3 target but still within a range that accounts for the possibility of a continued downward trend in the average.",
        "150": "Tendency towards Lower Numbers: The target numbers have consistently been on the lower end of the average, suggesting that players might be choosing numbers below the average. This could be due to a conservative strategy or an attempt to stay closer to the target.",
        "151": "Target Range: Given the previous target range, it's reasonable to expect the next target to be around 6.80 or lower, considering the decreasing trend. However, be cautious as other players might also be aware of this pattern, potentially causing a shift in the average.",
        "152": "Consider the Game's Progress: As the game progresses, players might become more risk-averse or develop patterns. Analyze the behavior of other players to predict their choices and adjust accordingly.",

        "155": "Estimate a Higher Average: Given that players might now choose numbers lower than the average to avoid the target, you could estimate a slightly higher average for the next round, say around 35-40.",
        "156": "Deviation Strategy: Choose a number that is slightly above or below the estimated target to account for potential adjustments by other players. If you think others will choose lower, you might want to choose a number slightly above the target.",
        "157": "Game Theory: Consider that other players might also be using strategies based on the game's history. Some might be choosing numbers based on the target, while others might be trying to manipulate the average. Be mindful of these potential strategies and adapt accordingly.",
        "158": "Consider the Target: The target numbers have been 21.33, 12.67, and 11.20. The decrease is not linear, but it's close. If the trend continues, the next target could be around 9.53 (2/3 of 14.28, which is a possible next average).",
        "159": "Buffer for Other Players' Behavior: Add a small buffer to your chosen number, anticipating that other players might choose numbers slightly above or below the target. This buffer should be based on your assessment of the game dynamics and the risk you're willing to take.",
        "160": "Consider the Range: Remember that the number must be between 0 and 100. Avoid choosing numbers that are too close to the extremes, as they might result in a larger deviation from the target.",
        "161": "Learn from Mistakes: Reflect on why your previous choices were not successful and use that information to inform your next decision.",
        "162": "Estimate the Shift: Reflect on whether players are likely to increase or decrease their numbers in the next round. If they believe the target is closer to the middle, they might choose higher numbers. If they think the target is lower, they might choose smaller numbers.",
        "163": "Account for Strategic Thinking: Some players might be using a fixed strategy, like always choosing 2/3 of the maximum (66.67), while others might be more adaptive. Try to anticipate these different approaches.",
        "164": "Target Number Calculation: If the average stays around 32, the target number for the next round would be 21.33 again. However, if the average shifts, you need to recalculate the target as 2/3 of the new average.",
        "165": "Range Considerations: Since the winning number in Round 1 was the average itself, it's possible that players might try to choose numbers closer to the target, which could push the average up or down. Consider how this might affect your choice.",
        "166": "Behavioral Anticipation: Players might be aware of the decreasing trend and could be more likely to choose 1, which has been a winning number in recent rounds. If you think others will also choose 1, you might want to choose a slightly lower number to be closer to the target.",
        "167": "Past Performance: Reflect on your own choices and the outcomes. You've won more often by choosing 1, but you've also lost when choosing 2. This suggests that staying closer to 1 might be safer.",
        "168": "Game Theory: If all players choose 1, the average will be 1, and the target will be 0.67. Choosing 1 in this case would result in a tie. If you think others will choose 1, you might want to consider a different number to potentially break the tie.",
        "169": "Track the Trend: The trend so far has been a steady decline in the average. However, with the recent string of wins with a chosen number of 1, it's possible that others might start to choose higher numbers, expecting the average to rise.",
        "170": "Avoid Overcompensation: While it's reasonable to expect a slight increase, overcompensating by choosing a much higher number could lead to being too far from the target.",
        "171": "Adapt to the Game's Progress: As the game progresses, players might become more risk-averse, leading to a clustering of numbers around the target. This could result in a more stable average.",
        "172": "Post-Game Reflection: After the round, analyze the results to refine your strategy. If the average continues to decrease, maintain or increase your conservativeness. If it increases, consider a more aggressive approach.",
        "173": "History of Your Own Choices: Reflect on your previous choices and how they might influence your next decision. If you've been consistently close to the average, you might want to consider a different strategy to stand out.",
        "174": "Adopt a More Conservative Strategy: Given that the winning numbers have been closer to the target than the average, consider choosing a number slightly below the calculated target to account for the possibility that others are still overestimating.",
        "175": "Monitor the Range: If the range of numbers chosen by players has been wide, it might indicate a lack of coordination or understanding. If the range narrows, it could suggest a more strategic approach.",
        "176": "Spread Analysis: Observe the difference between the winning number and the target in Round 2 (18 vs. 12.67). This suggests that players might be clustering their choices around the target, so consider a number that is slightly above or below the target to account for potential clustering.",
        "177": "Consider Overlap: Given the small range of numbers, it's possible that multiple players might choose the same number, especially if they're also observing the trend. Be prepared for the possibility of a tie.",

Factor in the possibility that they might adjust their choices again, either by choosing even lower numbers or by starting to balance their choices around the target.",
        "180": "Flexibility: Be prepared to adjust your strategy in subsequent rounds based on the outcome of this round. If the average remains low, it might indicate that players are still choosing below the average. If it increases, it could mean that players are starting to balance their choices more.",
        "181": "Flexibility: Be prepared to adjust your strategy in subsequent rounds based on the outcome of the current round. If you win, consider whether your strategy was a fluke or if it's a reliable approach. If you lose, analyze why and make necessary changes.",
        "182": "Monitor Your Strategy: If you've noticed a pattern in your own or others' choices, consider whether it's beneficial to continue with that pattern or switch to a different approach.",
        "183": "Flexibility: Be prepared to adjust your choice based on the numbers chosen by other players during the round. If you can see their choices before submitting your own, use that information to refine your decision.",
        "184": "Estimate a Shift: Anticipate a shift in the average due to players' adjustments. If players move towards the target, the average might decrease. If they move away from the winning number, it might increase. Estimate this shift based on your understanding of the players' behavior.",
        "185": "Estimate the Trend: Observe if there's a consistent trend in the average (increasing, decreasing, or fluctuating).",
        "186": "Predict the Next Average: Based on the trend, predict where the average might land in the next round. Consider if players will continue to choose numbers above or below the target.",
        "187": "Choose a Slightly Off-Target Number: Given the target range, choose a number slightly below the target if you think the average will increase, or slightly above the target if you think the average will decrease.",
        "188": "Account for Player Behavior: Consider if other players might be adjusting their strategies based on previous rounds, and try to anticipate their choices.",
        "189": "Risk Management: Balance the risk of being too close to the target or too far away. A number that is too close to the target might be more susceptible to being affected by other players' choices.",
        "190": "Learning from Others: Analyze the choices of other players in Round 1 to understand their reasoning. If possible, try to identify any patterns or strategies they might be following.",
        "191": "Flexibility: Be prepared to adjust your strategy as the game progresses. If the average consistently deviates from your expectations, adapt your choice accordingly.",
        "192": "Target Adaptation: The target number has also been decreasing, and it's generally closer to the lower end of the range. This indicates that choosing a number slightly below the target might be a good strategy, as you've won when doing so.",
        "193": "Predicting Next Average: Given the trend, it's likely that the average will continue to decrease. However, consider that other players might also have noticed this pattern and adjust their choices accordingly. This might slow down or reverse the trend.",
        "194": "Risk Mitigation: In the last round, you chose a number very close to the target (3), which won. For the next round, you might want to consider a slightly higher number to account for potential shifts in the average due to other players' reactions.",
        "195": "Consistency: If you observe that other players are consistently choosing numbers close to the target, it might be beneficial to maintain a similar strategy, as it seems to be working for the group.",
        "196": "Adaptation: Given the decreasing trend, it might be wise to choose a number that is even lower than the previous round's average, but not too far off to avoid overshooting the target.",
        "197": "Anticipating Others: Consider that other players might also be observing the trend and might choose slightly higher numbers this round.",
        "198": "Consider the Previous Round's Outcome: The fact that everyone chose 32 suggests a lack of strategic thinking or coordination among the players. It's possible that some players might adjust their strategies in the next round, knowing that choosing the exact average is not ideal.",
        "199": "Maintain a Balanced Approach: In Round 1, you won by choosing the average number itself, which was 32. In Round 2, you chose 20, which was higher than the target (12.67) but lower than the average (19). This suggests that you might have overcorrected your choice. For the next round, aim for a middle ground between the two extremes.",
        "200": "Track the Trend: The average has been decreasing consistently, from 32 to 1.4. This suggests that players are indeed adjusting their numbers downward. However, the decrease has not been linear, and there have been fluctuations.",
        "201": "Consider the Recent Rounds: The last few rounds have seen very low averages, with the last three rounds all having an average around 1.4. This could indicate that players are converging on a low number, possibly due to the success of choosing 1 in previous rounds.",
        "202": "Anticipate Reversal or Correction: Given the extremely low averages, players might start to think that others will choose higher numbers, leading to a potential reversal or correction in the trend. Be prepared for this possibility.",
        "203": "Variance in Player Behavior: Remember that players might not always follow a consistent pattern. Some might choose randomly, while others might have a more strategic approach. Factor in this uncertainty when making your choice.",
        "204": "History of Your Choices: Your recent choices have been close to the trend, but not always successful. Reflect on whether you need to adjust your strategy, perhaps by choosing a number that is slightly different from the recent averages.",
        "205": "Anticipate Other Players' Adjustments: Players might have learned from the previous rounds and could be choosing numbers closer to the target. Be prepared for a tighter clustering around the target.",
        "206": "Avoid Extreme Numbers: Given the target, numbers too far from 10.67 (e.g., very low or very high) are less likely to win. Choose a number that balances the risk of being too high or too low.",
        "207": "Learn from Mistakes: In Round 2, you chose 20, which was above the target (12.67) and the winning number (18). This suggests that you might have overestimated the average or didn't account for the potential shift towards lower numbers.",
        "208": "Adapt to the Current Round: In Round 12, you chose 0, which was too low. Given the average of 1.4, a more appropriate choice might have been around 1, closer to the target.",
        "209": "Variance Consideration: The game is not deterministic, and there might be some variance in the numbers chosen. Some players might stick to their previous choices, while others might choose more randomly.",
        "210": "Moderation and Flexibility: Choose a number that is moderate but flexible enough to adapt to potential changes in the average. This might mean selecting a number slightly below the previous target (21.33) but not too far from it.",
        "211": "Adapt to the Minimum: Since the game has reached very low numbers, there's a risk of overshooting the target if the average continues to decrease. Be mindful of the lower bound (0) and choose accordingly.",
        "212": "Anticipating Others' Anticipation: Consider that other players might also be thinking about the target and adjusting their choices accordingly. Try to predict how they might adjust their strategies based on this knowledge.",
        "213": "Buffer Zone: Add a small buffer to your estimate of the target number to account for potential fluctuations in the average due to other players' choices. This buffer could be a small percentage of the target or a fixed value based on the current range of numbers.",
        "214": "Avoiding Extremes: Since the game is about being closest to 2/3 of the average, it's generally better to stay away from the extremes (0 and 100) as they are less likely to be close to the target.",

The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - History of Your Choices: Choosing slightly below the target has been more advantageous, but don't become too predictable; other players might start to mimic your strategy.\n - Monitor the Range: If the game has a rule that all players must choose unique numbers, it might impact your choice. If the range is getting narrower, you might need to choose a number that hasn't been selected yet.\n - Anticipate Counter-Overcorrection: Some players might anticipate the overcorrection and choose a slightly higher number, like 1.2 or 1.3, to counteract it.\n - Anticipate Others' Choices: If players are aware of the recent winning numbers, they might also choose 1, which could lead to a higher average. Consider if choosing a slightly higher number (e.g., 2) might be beneficial if you anticipate this herd behavior.\n - Avoiding Zero: Choosing zero has resulted in losses in Round 8 and Round 9, even though the target was close.

        "1": "Consistency: Since there is only one round of data, it's difficult to identify consistent patterns. However, if this trend continues in future rounds, it might indicate that players are conservative in their choices or are trying to hit the target directly.",
        "2": "Adaptation: Since you won by choosing the average, it's possible that other players might adjust their strategies in the next round to avoid selecting the average again. They might choose numbers that are slightly lower or higher to account for this.",
        "3": "Risk Aversion: The winning number was the same as the average, which is a rare occurrence. Players might now be more cautious, trying to stay close to the average but not choosing it exactly.",

        "5": "Range Analysis: The average was 32, which is closer to the lower end of the range (0 to 100). Players might have been more inclined to choose lower numbers, or this could be a coincidence. Keep an eye on whether this trend persists.",
        "6": "Diversify Strategy: Don't always choose the average or the target. Instead, consider a number that is slightly above or below the anticipated target, depending on the perceived shift in player behavior.",
        "7": "Avoid Overthinking: Remember that the game is played over multiple rounds, so don't put too much pressure on a single choice. Use each round as an opportunity to learn and refine your strategy.",
        "8": "Flexibility: Be prepared to adjust your strategy if the game dynamics change unexpectedly. For example, if the average suddenly shifts back up, you should adapt accordingly.",
        "9": "Stay in the Middle: Since the target is 2/3 of the average, staying within a moderate range (around 20-40) might be a good strategy, as it's less likely to be too far from the target.",
        "10": "Estimate the Average: Given the trend, it's reasonable to expect numbers to continue decreasing, but not drastically. An average of 8-9 seems plausible.",
        "11": "Consider Recent Outcomes: The last few rounds have seen winning numbers closer to 1. This might suggest that players are overcorrecting, and you could try to be slightly more aggressive in your estimate.",
        "12": "Anticipate Counter-Strategies: Be prepared for a potential shift in the average as players might start choosing numbers closer to the extremes to avoid the average.",
        "13": "History Analysis: Analyze the history of your own choices and the outcomes to adjust your strategy accordingly.",
        "14": "Game Theory: Consider the game-theoretic aspects, such as the possibility of other players using strategies like the minimax or Nash equilibrium, which might influence your choice if you believe others are also thinking strategically.",
        "15": "Post-Game Analysis: After the round, analyze the results to refine your strategy for the next round. If the average continues to decrease, it might indicate that players are consistently choosing numbers below the average, and you might need to adjust your strategy accordingly.",
        "16": "Learning from Others: Observe the behavior of other players. If they are also adjusting downward, you might need to choose even lower than your calculated estimate to win.",
        "17": "Anticipating a Floor: There might be a floor to the numbers chosen, as players might not want to choose 0 again after recent rounds. This could lead to a slight increase in the average.",
        "18": "Overestimation Correction: Since players tend to overestimate, consider choosing a number slightly below the calculated 2/3 of the average to account for this trend.",
        "19": "Risk Management: The winning numbers have often been 1, which is the minimum possible choice. This might indicate that many players are choosing 1 to minimize the risk of overshooting the target. However, this strategy could lead to a higher average in the future, so it's essential to balance risk and reward.",
        "20": "Learning from Past Mistakes: In Round 15, you chose 2, which was above the target of 1.07. This suggests that you might need to adjust your estimate even lower for the next round.",
        "21": "Anticipating Future Adjustments: As the game progresses, players might start to realize the pattern of overestimation and adjust their choices accordingly. Be prepared for this shift in strategy.",
        "22": "Game Dynamics: Since the game is played over multiple rounds, consider the long-term implications of your choices. If everyone starts choosing 1, the average might stabilize, and the target could shift upward again.",
        "23": "Tightening the Range: It seems that the average number chosen by all players has been decreasing over time. This could indicate that players are adjusting their choices to be lower. Therefore, consider choosing numbers closer to or below the target, even if it means selecting a number below the average.",
        "24": "Avoiding Overconfidence: Winning by choosing the exact average (as in Round 1) might lead to overconfidence. Remember that the target is 2/3 of the average, so being slightly below the average might be more beneficial.",
        "25": "Adapting to the Game Progression: As the numbers chosen decrease, the target also decreases. This means that the winning number is likely to be closer to 0. Be prepared to choose very low numbers as the game progresses.",
        "26": "Consistency in Strategy: Since you've won by choosing 1 in multiple rounds, it might be a good idea to stick with this number or slightly adjust it based on the estimated average and target. However, be aware that if others catch on to this pattern, they might also choose 1, potentially pushing the average up.",
        "27": "Identify Trend Breaks: Analyze the game log to see if there are any patterns in the changes of the average. Note the rounds where the average didn't decrease significantly or increased.",
        "28": "Consider Player Adaptation: Players might have noticed the consistent decline and might start choosing slightly higher numbers to anticipate a potential rebound. Take this into account when estimating the next average.",
        "29": "History of Winning Numbers: Observe the winning numbers in the recent rounds. If they've been consistently lower, it might indicate that players are still choosing lower numbers. If there's a mix, it could suggest that players are experimenting with different strategies.",
        "30": "Consider the Range: The numbers have been decreasing, but they haven't reached the lower limit (0). Keep in mind that players might be hesitant to choose numbers too close to 0, as it could lead to a large deviation from the target.",
        "31": "Historical Analysis: Analyze the difference between the target and the winning number. In Round 5, the winning number was 1 away from the target. This might indicate that players are getting better at estimating the target.",
        "32": "Risk Management: Balance the risk of choosing a number that is too high (anticipating a rebound) or too low (following the declining trend). A moderate choice might be safer, but it could also be less likely to win if others have a similar strategy.",
        "33": "Anticipate Others' Anticipation: Consider that other players might also be thinking about the potential rebound. Try to predict how they might adjust their strategies based on this knowledge.",
        "34": "Adaptation: Given the past results, adjust your strategy for the next round. If you think a rebound is likely, choose a number slightly above the current trend. If you think the decline will continue, choose a number slightly below the current trend.",
        "35": "Target Calculation: Calculate the target number based on your estimated average for the next round. Be mindful of the potential for rounding errors, as the target is calculated using 2/3 of the average.",
        "36": "Deviation from Symmetry: If you think players are overcorrecting from previous rounds, you might want to choose a number that is slightly higher or lower than the target, depending on the direction of the trend.",
        "37": "Predicting Others' Behavior: Try to predict how other players might react to the recent outcomes. If they've been losing, they might be more cautious or aggressive in their choices.",
        "38": "Margin of Error: Consider a small margin of error around the target, as it's challenging to predict the exact average. Choose a number that allows for a small deviation while still being competitive.",
        "39": "Risk Mitigation: Given the recent trend, choosing a number slightly below the current average might be a safer bet, as it accounts for the possibility of others continuing to choose lower numbers. However, don't rule out the possibility of a sudden shift back to higher numbers.",
        "40": "Individual Strategy: Reflect on your own strategy so far. You've been relatively close to the average but not the target. Consider whether you should be more aggressive in your estimation or play it safe and stay close to the current trend.",
        "41": "Embrace Uncertainty: Recognize that there is inherent uncertainty in the game, and no strategy is foolproof. Be ready to accept both wins and losses and continuously refine your approach based on new information.",
        "42": "Strategic Deviation: Consider deviating from the average by a calculated amount, based on the trend and the target range. For example, if you think the average will continue to drop, choose a number slightly below the expected average to aim for the target.",
        "43": "Adaptation: Be prepared to change your strategy as the game progresses. If the average starts to stabilize, you might need to adjust your target range estimation.",
        "44": "Consistency: If you notice a consistent pattern in the winning numbers (e.g., always slightly below the target), try to maintain a similar strategy in the next rounds.",
        "45": "Consider Round-to-Round Variability: Players might adjust their strategies after each round, so don't assume that the same pattern will repeat. They might choose higher or lower numbers in the next round based on the outcome of Round 1.",
        "46": "Estimate the Shift: If players learned from Round 1 that the average was too high, they might choose lower numbers in the next round. Conversely, if they think the average was too low, they might choose higher numbers. Estimate how much this shift might be.",
        "47": "Range Considerations: Since the range is from 0 to 100, it's unlikely that all players will choose the exact same number. There will be some dispersion. Consider a distribution that reflects this, such as a normal distribution or a uniform distribution, depending on the perceived behavior of the other players.",
        "48": "Analyze the Decreasing Trend: The average has been consistently dropping, but it's uncertain if this trend will continue. Players might start to choose higher numbers if they believe the trend has bottomed out.",
        "49": "Consider the Target's Impact: Since the target is 2/3 of the average, choosing a number slightly below the target has been more successful. However, if the average is expected to increase, you might want to consider a number closer to the target.",
        "50": "Trend Continuation: Given the current trend, it's reasonable to consider choosing a number slightly lower than the previous round's average (6.4). A number around 5-6 might be a good starting point.",
        "51": "Anticipate Reversal: Since the numbers have been consistently decreasing, players might start to think that the average is getting too low and choose higher numbers in the next round. This could lead to a sudden increase in the average. Be prepared for this by considering a slightly higher number, perhaps around 7-8.",
        "52": "Target Deviation: Given the target is 2/3 of the average, a deviation of 1-2 from the target might still be within a winning range. In Round 5, the winning number was 5, which was only 1.27 away from the target (4.27). So, aim for a number that is close to 2/3 of your estimated average, with a small buffer for potential variation.",
        "53": "Continued Decrease in Average: Expect the average number chosen to continue decreasing. Players might be more cautious after seeing the trend of lower winning numbers.",
        "54": "Consider Extreme Cases: While it's unlikely, be prepared for the possibility of an extreme scenario where all players choose the same number. In this case, the average would be the same as the chosen number, and the target would be 2/3 of that number.",
        "55": "Learn from Others' Mistakes: Analyze the winning numbers and try to understand why they were chosen. Were they outliers in the previous round, or did a group of players coordinate? This can help you anticipate potential shifts in the average.",
        "56": "Adapt to the Game Progress: As the game progresses, players might become more risk-tolerant or risk-averse. Observe this behavior and adjust your strategy accordingly.",
        "57": "Set a Personal Threshold: Establish a personal threshold for how low you're willing to go. This can help you avoid choosing numbers that are too low, which might become a new pattern if others start choosing higher numbers again.",
        "58": "Post-Game Reflection: After each round, review your choice and the winning number. Reflect on whether your strategy was effective and if any adjustments are needed for the next round.",
        "59": "Game Theory: Consider if other players are using a similar strategy. If everyone is thinking of choosing a higher number, the average might not increase as much as expected. Conversely, if everyone is still choosing lower numbers, the average might continue to decrease.",
        "60": "Estimate a Lower Average: Since the average has been decreasing, it's reasonable to expect a lower average for the next round. However, be cautious as this trend may not continue indefinitely.",
        "61": "Consider the Range: The winning numbers have been within a range of 1-2 points below the target. So, if you estimate the average to be, say, 5, aim for a number around 3.33 (2/3 of 5) but slightly lower, perhaps 3.",
        "62": "Adapt to Other Players' Strategies: If you notice other players consistently choosing numbers below the average, you might need to adjust your strategy to choose even lower to stay competitive.",
        "63": "Anticipate Overcorrection: Some players might have noticed the decreasing trend and might choose even lower numbers, thinking the average will drop further. This could lead to a higher average than expected if enough players overcorrect.",
        "64": "Consider Randomness: There's always a degree of unpredictability in the game, as each player's choice is influenced by their own reasoning. Some might choose randomly, which could affect the average.",
        "65": "Learn from Past Mistakes: Reflect on your own choices and the outcomes. If you've been consistently choosing numbers that are too high or too low, adjust your strategy accordingly.",
        "66": "Variability: Keep in mind that the game is stochastic, and there might be outliers or unexpected choices that could significantly impact the average.",
        "67": "Adaptation: Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on the results of the current round. If the average continues to decrease, it might indicate a consistent trend. If it increases, it could suggest a shift in player behavior.",
        "68": "History of Your Own Choices: Reflect on your previous choice (32) and whether it was a result of a specific strategy or a coincidence. If it was strategic, consider sticking with a similar approach or adjusting it based on the new information.",
        "69": "Learning from Others: If you have access to other players' choices, analyze their strategies. Are they consistently choosing numbers close to the average, the target, or do they have a different pattern?",
        "70": "Analyze the Previous Round: The fact that the average was chosen as the winning number suggests that players might not have been actively trying to hit the target or they might have had a wide range of selections. This could indicate a lack of coordination or a misunderstanding of the game mechanics.",
        "71": "Consider Strategic Adjustments: Since the target was 2/3 of the average, players might now be more aware and try to choose numbers lower than the average to push the target closer to their chosen numbers. This could lead to a lower average in the next round.",
        "72": "Estimate the New Average: Given the previous round's average of 6.4, estimate a range for the next average considering the possibility of players choosing lower numbers or overcorrecting by choosing higher numbers.",
        "73": "Target Proximity: Given the history of winning numbers being very close to the target, aim for a number that is within a narrow margin of the calculated target. A small deviation might increase your chances of winning.",
        "74": "Avoid Overconfidence: Be cautious not to rely too heavily on past success from Round 1, as the game dynamics change with each round.",
        "75": "Learn from Mistakes: Analyze why your choices in Rounds 2-5 were not successful and use this information to inform your next decision.",
        "76": "Balance Risk and Reward: Since the target is lower, choosing a number closer to the lower end of the estimated average range (20-25) might be safer, but it could also lead to a lower target if the average is closer to 25. Conversely, choosing a number closer to the higher end of the range could result in a larger deviation if the average is closer to 20.",
        "77": "Calculate the New Target Range: If the new average is around 26-30, the target would be around 17.33-20 (2/3 of the average). Keep in mind that the target is a single number, so you'll need to choose a number that is closest to this range.",
        "78": "Avoiding Overcorrection: While it's tempting to adjust your number downward, be cautious of overcorrecting. In Round 2, you chose 19, which was too close to the previous round's average, and in Round 3, you chose 22, which was too high considering the trend.",
        "79": "Anticipate Others' Behavior: Players might start clustering around the target, so consider a number that is slightly off-center to avoid a tie.",
        "80": "History and Trends: If you have data from multiple rounds, analyze the trends in the averages and targets. This can help you identify any patterns or shifts in player behavior.",
        "81": "Flexibility: Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on the numbers chosen by other players during the round. If you notice a trend emerging, you can make a last-minute adjustment before submitting your number.",
        "82": "Understanding the First Round: Since it's the first round, there might not be a clear pattern or strategy among the players. The average chosen number (32) could be a result of random selections or a conservative approach.",
        "83": "Target Number Calculation: The target number (2/3 of the average) was 21.33, and you won by choosing 32. This indicates that the overall average was pulled up by some players choosing numbers higher than the target.",
        "84": "Player Behavior Analysis: Observe if players tend to choose numbers close to the target or if they have a bias towards higher or lower numbers. This can help you predict the average for the next round.",
        "85": "Risk vs. Reward: In the first round, choosing a number slightly above the target worked in your favor. However, this might not always be the case. Consider the risk of choosing a number that is too high or too low, and adjust accordingly.",
        "86": "Learning from Your Win: Analyze why your choice of 32 was successful. Was it a lucky guess, or did you have a specific reasoning behind it? Use this information to inform your next decision.",
        "87": "Range of Numbers: Given the first round's average, consider if there's a tendency for numbers to cluster around a specific range (e.g., 20-40). This could help you narrow down your choice.",
        "88": "Consistency vs. Adaptability: Decide if you want to maintain a consistent strategy or adapt it based on the evolving game dynamics. If you choose to adapt, consider how much you want to deviate from your previous choice.",
        "89": "Anticipating Others' Adjustments: Assume that others will learn from the first round as well. They might choose numbers closer to the target or try to counteract your winning strategy.",
        "90": "Randomness Factor: Acknowledge that some level of randomness will always be present. While analyzing patterns is helpful, don't rely solely on past results.",
        "91": "Player Behavior: In Round 1, all players, including you, chose a number close to the middle of the range (32). This suggests a conservative or cautious approach from the players, possibly due to a lack of information or a desire to avoid extremes.",
        "92": "Target Adjustment: Calculate 2/3 of the expected new average. Given the trend, it might be lower than the previous target, but don't assume a linear decrease.",

        "230": "Game Theory: If the game has reached a point where everyone is aware of the recent averages and the winning number, it might become a game of chicken, with players trying to outguess each other. In this case, a strategic choice could be to choose a number that is just slightly above or below the average you expect, depending on the perceived risk tolerance of the other players.",
        "231": "Final Decision: After considering all these factors, make a decision that best aligns with your analysis and risk tolerance. It could be 1, 2, or a number slightly above or below, depending on your deductions and the perceived behavior of other players.",

        "246": "Tight Range: The numbers chosen have been consistently low, ranging from 0 to 22. This indicates that players are likely playing conservatively, trying not to go too high.",
        "247": "Round History: Analyze the trend of the average chosen number. It seems to have been decreasing over time, possibly due to players learning from previous rounds and adjusting their choices.",
        "248": "Anticipate Adaptation: Players might start to catch on to the pattern of choosing just below the target. Be prepared for a potential shift in their behavior.",
        "249": "Small Adjustments: Given the narrow range of winning numbers, small adjustments to your choice can make a big difference. Consider the target and the potential for other players to choose just below it.",

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Tightening the Range: Your losses have mainly occurred when you chose '2', which was consistently above the target. This suggests that numbers closer to '1' are more likely to be closer to the target, especially when the average is below 2.\n - Diversify Strategy: Since the game has been won mostly with 1, consider choosing a number slightly above or below the average to exploit potential overcorrections by other players. For example, if you think the average will be 1.6, you might choose 1.4 or 1.7.\n - Game Dynamics: Since the game is played over multiple rounds, players might be learning from their mistakes and adjusting their strategies. Consider that others might also be observing the trend of decreasing averages and targets.\n - Choose a Slightly Lower Number: Given the narrow range of winning numbers, consider choosing 0 or 1. If you think others might also choose 1, you might want to lean towards 0 to be on the safer side.\n - Adaptation to Recent Rounds: In the last few rounds, the winning number has been 1, which is the minimum possible choice. This could indicate that players are now very cautious and are choosing the minimum to minimize the risk of overshooting the target.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

        "152": "Risk Management: In this case, the risk is low since the trend suggests a very small target. However, consider the possibility of other players choosing a slightly different number, and adjust accordingly to minimize the potential deviation from the target.",
        "153": "Buffer Zone: Consider a buffer zone around the estimated average, accounting for the potential decrease in the average and the target number. A smaller decrease might mean a narrower buffer.",
        "154": "Game Round Awareness: Consider that this is round 6, and players might be more cautious and strategic, having learned from previous rounds. This could lead to a more concentrated selection around the target, so consider this when choosing your number.",
        "155": "Final Decision: Based on the estimated decrease, the trend analysis, and the potential behavior of other players, choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the next round's average, taking into account the potential for a smaller decrease.",
        "156": "Risk Mitigation: Since the game is about being closest to the target, consider a range of numbers around the estimated target instead of a single number. This can help you hedge against a slight miscalculation or an unexpected change in the players' behavior.",
        "157": "Target Shift: The target number has also decreased accordingly (21.33, 12.67, 11.20). This indicates that the winning number is becoming smaller as the average decreases.",
        "158": "Deviation from Target: In Round 2, the winning number was 1.33 below the target, while in Round 3, it was 1.20 below. This suggests that players might be underestimating the target slightly.",
        "159": "Continuing the Decreasing Trend: Given the pattern of decreasing averages, consider choosing a number lower than your previous choice (12) but not too far from it, as the trend might not continue indefinitely.",
        "160": "Estimate the Average with a Bias: Since players seem to be choosing numbers lower than the target, when estimating the average, consider a slightly lower range than the actual midpoint of the 0 to 100 interval. This will help account for the tendency to underchoose.",
        "161": "Analyze Your Own Strategy: Review your choices and the outcomes. You've won when choosing a number close to the target, but lost when choosing a number that was too high. This reinforces the need to stay close to the adjusted target.",

        "166": "Variance and Risk: Be aware of the potential for outliers or sudden shifts in player behavior. A few high or low choices can significantly impact the average, so consider the risk of choosing too far from the expected range.",
        "167": "Anticipating Others: Assume that other players are also observing the trend and might choose lower numbers. Factor this into your decision-making process.",
        "168": "Target Awareness: Players seem to be underestimating the target, as the winning numbers have been consistently below the target. This could indicate that players are being more cautious and choosing numbers slightly lower than 2/3 of the average.",
        "169": "Risk Aversion: Players might be avoiding the exact target number, fearing that others will also choose it, leading to a tie and potentially no winner.",
        "170": "Predicting Next Round: Given the trend, it's reasonable to expect the average to continue decreasing. However, be cautious as players might start to realize the decreasing trend and adjust their choices accordingly.",
        "171": "Strategic Deviation: Consider choosing a number that is slightly higher than the perceived average, as others might be choosing lower numbers. This could help you get closer to the target, which is 2/3 of the average.",
        "172": "Avoiding Extremes: Given the recent winning numbers, it's clear that choosing numbers too close to the extremes (0 or 100) is risky. Aim for a middle ground that is close to the target but not too far from the average.",
        "173": "Learning from Mistakes: Reflect on your own choices and why they didn't result in a win. In Round 5, choosing 6 was a good attempt but still slightly above the winning number. Adjust your strategy accordingly.",
        "174": "Estimate the Shift: Reflect on whether players are likely to increase or decrease their numbers in the next round. If they believe the target is closer to the middle, they might choose higher numbers. If they think the target is lower, they might choose smaller numbers.",
        "175": "Learn from Others' Mistakes: In Round 2, you chose 20, which was above the target (12.67) and the winning number (18). Analyze why this happened and consider if players might be choosing numbers that are consistently too high or too low.",
        "176": "Consider the Target Range: Since the target is 2/3 of the average, a good strategy might be to choose a number that is close to the target range's middle point. This could be a safer bet, as it's less likely to be too high or too low.",
        "177": "Adapt to the Game Progress: As the game progresses, players might be adjusting their strategies. Observe if there's a pattern in the changes, such as players converging on a specific range or diverging.",

        "180": "Consider the Range of Numbers: Since the game allows numbers from 0 to 100, avoid choosing numbers that are too close to the extremes. Numbers near the middle of the range are more likely to be closer to the target, as players might be hesitant to choose extreme values.",
        "181": "Anticipate Others' Behavior: Players might be learning from their past mistakes and adjusting their choices. If they see that the averages are decreasing, they might choose even lower numbers. Conversely, if they think the trend has been noticed, they might choose numbers closer to the average to counteract the trend.",

        "183": "Consider the Target's Sensitivity to Average: Since the target is 2/3 of the average, small changes in the average can lead to significant changes in the target. In Round 2, a decrease of 13 in the average (from 32 to 19) led to a decrease of 8.66 in the target (from 21.33 to 12.67). This indicates that the target is more sensitive to changes in the lower end of the range.",
        "184": "Adjust for the Target's Shift: Since the target is 2/3 of the average, if you expect the average to decrease, you should choose a lower number, and vice versa. Analyze the game dynamics to anticipate the direction of the average.",
        "185": "Consider the Impact of Your Choice: Your choice can influence the average, so think about how your number might affect the outcome. If you think others will choose higher numbers, you might want to choose lower, and vice versa.",
        "186": "Probabilistic Approach: You could consider a probabilistic distribution, such as a uniform distribution, to estimate the average. However, if you observe any patterns or biases in the players' choices, adjust your estimation accordingly.",
        "187": "Game Theory: If you believe other players are strategic, consider game theory concepts like the Nash equilibrium or social dilemmas, which might influence their choices.",
        "188": "Player Behavior Observation: In Round 1, the average number chosen was 32, which indicates that players might have selected numbers around the middle of the range (0 to 100). This could suggest a conservative or random strategy.",
        "189": "Estimating the Average: Since you don't have information about the specific numbers chosen by other players, it's challenging to estimate the next round's average. However, you can consider that players might adjust their choices after seeing the outcome of Round 1. They might choose higher or lower numbers to avoid the average.",
        "190": "Learn from Past Rounds: Observe that the average has been decreasing from round to round. This might indicate that players are adjusting their choices to be closer to the target or to avoid the average.",

        "201": "Risk vs. Reward: In Round 1, you chose the average, which was a winning strategy. However, in future rounds, you might need to balance the risk of choosing a number that is too close to the average (which might not be the target) versus choosing a number that is closer to the target but could be farther from the average.",
        "202": "Maintain Flexibility: Be prepared to adjust your strategy as the game progresses. If the average continues to be high or low, you might need to change your approach to better align with the target.",
        "203": "Avoid Overthinking: While analyzing the game dynamics is important, don't overcomplicate your strategy. Sometimes, a simple approach, like choosing a number close to the target without considering too many variables, might be effective.",
        "204": "Consider Overcorrection: After the last round where everyone chose 2, it's possible that players might overcorrect and choose numbers higher than the previous round's average, thinking that others will choose higher as well.",
        "205": "Variance in Choices: Anticipate that there might be more variance in the numbers chosen this round due to the lack of clear strategy or coordination.",
        "206": "Risk Management: Since the game is ongoing, consider the long-term implications of your choice. A safer strategy might be to choose a number that is slightly lower than the estimated target, as it's less likely for the average to decrease significantly in one round.",
        "207": "Consider Others' Learning: Assume that other players are also learning from their experiences. They might be more cautious and strategic in their choices, so be prepared for a more unpredictable average.",
        "208": "Avoiding Overcorrection: Players might be cautious not to overcorrect their strategy, as choosing numbers too far below the previous average could result in a new average that is too low, causing the target to be even more distant.",
        "209": "Consider the Trend: The average has been decreasing round by round, but it's uncertain if this trend will continue. Be aware of the possibility that the average might stabilize or even increase if players start choosing higher numbers due to the recent low averages.",
        "210": "Anticipate Randomness: Since some players might choose randomly, it's hard to predict their exact numbers. However, you can assume that a certain percentage of players will choose numbers near the extremes (0 or 100) or around the previous average.",
        "211": "Diversify Your Strategy: Given the randomness and potential for diverse choices, consider varying your number selection slightly from round to round. This can help you adapt to unexpected shifts in the average.",
        "212": "Target a Range: Instead of focusing on a single number, consider a range around the target number. This can help you account for potential fluctuations in the average due to random or diversified choices.",
        "213": "Learn from Others: Observe the winning numbers and try to identify any patterns or strategies that successful players might be using. This can inform your decision-making process.",
        "214": "Individual Behavior: Observe if any player consistently chooses a specific number or follows a recognizable pattern. This information could help you predict the next average.",

        "216": "Estimate the Correction: Players might have learned from the previous rounds and might choose numbers closer to the target range. Estimate how much they might correct their choices from the previous round's average.",
        "217": "Analyze Recent Outliers: If there were any outliers in the previous rounds, consider if they might influence the choices in the current round.",
        "218": "Adapt to the Game Progression: As the game progresses, the numbers might converge around a smaller range. Adjust your choice accordingly.",
        "219": "Risk Mitigation: Choose a number that is neither too high nor too low, considering the potential shift in the average. A moderate deviation from the previous average (32) could be a good starting point, but you should also consider the possibility of others thinking similarly.",
        "220": "Target Calculation: Always calculate the target number (2/3 of the average) precisely. This is crucial for making informed decisions.",
        "221": "Risk Mitigation: In the earlier rounds, you chose numbers that were slightly higher than the target, which led to losses. In later rounds, when the average was lower, choosing numbers closer to or equal to the target or even slightly below it led to wins.",
        "222": "Buffer Zone: Consider adding a small buffer to your chosen number, especially if the average is close to the lower limit (0). This can help account for potential underestimation of the average or other players choosing even lower numbers.",
        "223": "Adaptation: If the average continues to decrease, you might need to choose even lower numbers. However, if the average starts to increase, adjust your strategy accordingly and choose higher numbers.",
        "224": "Avoid Overconfidence: Winning consecutive rounds can lead to overconfidence. Always approach each round as a new challenge and be prepared to adapt.",
        "225": "Game Theory: Consider the possibility of other players using game theory strategies, such as choosing the number that will result in the target being hit exactly. This might lead to a clustering of numbers around the target, so be prepared for such scenarios.",
        "226": "Estimate a Lower Average: Given the decreasing trend, expect the average to be lower than the previous round. However, be cautious of a potential bounce back if players start to overcorrect.",
        "227": "Stay Close to the Target: Given the recent rounds where the winning number was 1, it's likely that players will try to be closer to the target this time. However, don't choose the exact target, as others might also have the same idea, and the average might push the target away.",
        "228": "Learn from Your Mistakes: Reflect on your previous choices and the reasons behind winning or losing. Use this information to refine your estimation for the next round.",
        "229": "Coordination or Cooperation (if possible): If there is an opportunity for communication or collaboration, attempt to coordinate with other players to choose numbers that would result in a specific average, making it easier to hit the target.",

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Historical Performance: Your recent choices have been consistently higher than the winning number, which has been 1 for the last four rounds. This suggests that you might want to choose a number closer to 1 to increase your chances of winning.\n - Anticipate Counter-Strategies: Be prepared for other players to adjust their choices based on your previous wins. They might choose numbers closer to the target or try to counter your strategy.\n - Avoid Overreacting to Losses: It's important not to overreact to losing rounds. Stick to your strategy and make small adjustments based on the evolving game dynamics.\n - Risk Mitigation: Given the recent trend of choosing lower numbers, it might be safer to choose 1, as it's closer to the target in recent rounds. However, if you suspect that other players are also recognizing this pattern, choosing 2 might be a strategic move to avoid a tie.\n - Anticipating Others' Thinking: Consider the possibility that other players may also be using similar sub-goals. Try to predict if they will be thinking conservatively or aggressively, and adjust your choice accordingly.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

        "5": "Strategic Deviation: To avoid clustering around the same number, consider choosing a number that is slightly off the expected average or target, but still within a reasonable range. This could help you stand out if others are making similar calculations.",
        "6": "History Avoidance: Given that you've won when choosing the exact target number (Round 1 and Round 4), and lost when choosing a number slightly above the target (Round 3 and Round 5), you might want to avoid choosing a number that is too close to the target.",
        "7": "Risk Management: Given the recent pattern of winning numbers being one less than the target, choosing a number slightly below the calculated target might be a safer bet. But remember that if everyone adopts this strategy, the average might shift, and the winning number could be different.",
        "8": "Margin of Error: Given the variability in player choices, consider a small margin of error around the target or the winning trend. This could help you choose a number that accounts for potential fluctuations in the average.",
        "9": "Regression to the Mean: Consider that the trend might not be linear, and there could be a regression to a more central value. Players might start selecting numbers closer to the middle of the range (0 to 100) as they become more uncertain about the decreasing trend.",
        "10": "Past Performance: Analyze your own performance and the winning numbers. You've won when you chose numbers close to the target, but you've lost when you overestimated or underestimated the target. This suggests the need for a more precise calculation of the target and a cautious approach to your choice.",
        "11": "Player Behavior: Observe if other players are also adapting their strategies. If they are consistently choosing lower numbers, it might be wise to follow suit, but if they are oscillating, you might need to adjust your strategy accordingly.",
        "12": "Risk Management: Since the game is ongoing, you can afford to take calculated risks. If you think the trend will continue, you might choose a number slightly lower than the target to account for potential overshooting by other players. If you think the trend will reverse, choose a number that is closer to the target.",
        "13": "Risk Mitigation: Since the winning number has been 1 for the last few rounds, it's clear that players are trying to avoid choosing numbers that could be too high. This might be a result of learning from previous losses or a general consensus to play it safe.",
        "14": "Anticipating Others' Behavior: Expect that other players will continue to choose 1, given the recent success of this strategy. However, be aware that some might try to exploit this pattern by choosing a slightly higher number, assuming others will choose 1.",
        "15": "Strategic Choice: Given the current trend, choosing 1 seems like a safe bet, but it's also a crowded choice. If you want to differentiate yourself, you could consider choosing a number slightly above 1 (e.g., 2) to potentially win if others stick to 1 and the average increases slightly.",
        "16": "Estimate the Average: Given the range of 1.0 to 1.6 for the average, calculate 2/3 of this range to get a target range of 0.67 to 1.07.",
        "17": "History and Pattern Recognition: Observe that you've won when choosing 1, but also lost when choosing 2 in similar situations. This suggests that being slightly below the target might be more advantageous.",
        "18": "Adaptation: Given the recent wins with choosing 1, it might be wise to stick with that choice or choose a number very close to it, considering the potential clustering of numbers around the winning number.",
        "19": "Tighten your range: Since the numbers have been consistently low, focus on a tighter range around the target number. Given the recent averages, the target numbers have been very close to 1, so a small deviation can lead to a win or loss.",
        "20": "Consider the trend: The average has been decreasing, but it seems to be stabilizing around 1.6-1.8. If you think the trend will continue, you might want to choose a number slightly below the target to account for a potential slight increase in the average.",
        "21": "Be prepared for fluctuations: The game is not purely deterministic, and there might be occasional fluctuations in the average due to random choices. Be ready to adjust your strategy if the average suddenly shifts.",
        "22": "Predict the Average: Given the recent history, it's possible that players will continue to choose 1, causing the average to remain low. However, some players might start to deviate slightly to avoid ties. Consider a range of possible averages, such as 1.6-2.2.",
        "23": "Post-Game Feedback: Reflect on the results of this round to refine your strategy for future rounds. If the average remains low and tied around 1, you might need to adjust your approach.",
        "24": "Tighten the Range: Since you've won more often with 1, it indicates that the other players might also be choosing numbers close to the lower end of the range. This could be due to the game's progression and the realization that lower numbers are closer to the target.",
        "25": "Target the Target: Given the pattern, it's crucial to stay close to the target number, which is 2/3 of the average. In the last few rounds, the target has been around 1, and you've won when you chose 1.",
        "26": "Risk Management: Since the game is now in the later rounds, players might be more risk-averse, choosing numbers that are closer to the target. This could push the average down even further.",
        "27": "Adapt to the Game Progression: As the game progresses, the numbers are getting closer to 0. Players might start to think that choosing 0 is the safest bet, but if everyone does that, the average will be 0, and the target will be 0.67. This could create an opportunity for a higher number to win.",
        "28": "Avoid Overconfidence: While choosing 1 has been successful, don't become too reliant on it. Be aware that other players might also have noticed this pattern and could start choosing 1, which could push the average up.",
        "29": "Target Deviation: Consider that other players might be choosing below the calculated target, potentially pushing the winning number even lower. Be cautious of overcompensating, as too low a number could result in a larger deviation.",
        "30": "Past Performance: Analyze your own and others' performance. Consider that winning occurred when a number close to the average or slightly below it was chosen, suggesting that other players might also be adopting a similar strategy.",
        "31": "Game Theory: Realize that if all players continue to choose lower numbers, the average will eventually converge to zero. However, this is a Nash equilibrium, and players might start deviating from it once they realize the pattern.",
        "32": "Randomness: Be prepared for unexpected shifts in the average, as there might be some randomness in the choices. Don't rely solely on the trend.",
        "33": "Consider the Range: Since the game started with higher numbers and is now converging towards lower numbers, be aware of the potential floor (0) and ceiling (100) of the range. As the average gets closer to the floor, the target will also approach it, making it more challenging to choose a winning number.",
        "34": "Estimate Deviation: Calculate the standard deviation of the numbers chosen in previous rounds. This can give you an idea of how scattered the choices are. If the deviation is high, it might be safer to choose a number closer to the target, as players might be choosing more randomly.",
        "35": "Target Buffer: Add a small buffer to your target number estimate. This can help account for potential rounding errors or slight miscalculations.",
        "36": "Adapt to Recent Outcomes: If you've lost in the last few rounds by choosing a number that was too high or too low, adjust your choice to be closer to the winning number in the previous round.",
        "37": "Risk Assessment: Weigh the risk of choosing a number that is too close to the extremes. In the current situation, with the average and target numbers getting smaller, choosing a number too close to 0 might result in losing if the average doesn't drop as much as expected.",
        "38": "Risk Assessment: Since the game has been won with 1 in the last few rounds, choosing 1 again might be risky, as others might also choose it. A small increment (e.g., 2 or 3) could be a safer bet, but it depends on the perceived behavior of the other players.",
        "39": "Final Choice: Given the information, you might consider choosing a number between 1 and 2, taking into account the potential for a slight increase in the average due to players' reactions to the decreasing trend. A conservative choice might be 1.5, but you should also consider the possibility that the trend might reverse or stabilize.",
        "40": "Target Deviation: In Round 11, the target number was 1.33, but the winning number was 1. This indicates that players might be underestimating the target, possibly due to the decreasing average trend.",
        "41": "Learning from Losses: Your losses occurred when you chose numbers that were higher than the winning number. This suggests that choosing slightly below the calculated target might be a safer strategy.",
        "42": "Adaptation: Given the recent trend of choosing lower numbers, you might want to choose a number that is slightly below the calculated target but not too far off, as the average could stabilize or even increase slightly.",
        "43": "Flexibility: Be prepared for the possibility that the trend might not hold, and players might choose a wider range of numbers. This could result in a less predictable average.",
        "44": "Trend Analysis: The trend so far is a downward slope in the average number chosen. Keep this in mind when deciding on your number for the next round.",
        "45": "Target Range: Since you've won when choosing numbers close to the winning number, it's a good strategy to continue this approach. However, consider that the winning number has been 1 in the last few rounds, so a slight adjustment upward might be necessary to account for potential changes in others' strategies.",
        "46": "Anticipate Others' Adjustments: Players might start to realize that choosing 1 repeatedly is not optimal, as it could lead to ties and shared winnings. They might start to spread out their choices slightly, so consider a number slightly above 1 but not too far from it.",
        "47": "Game Dynamics: Since the game is played over multiple rounds, consider the long-term implications of your choices. If you've won more often by being slightly above the winning number, maintain that pattern to avoid being predictable.",
        "48": "Post-Game Feedback: Reflect on your losses and wins. In Round 11, you chose 3, which was too high compared to the winning number (1). This might indicate that you should choose a number closer to the lower end of the range.",
        "49": "Target Buffer: Given the decreasing trend, consider choosing a number slightly below the calculated target to account for the possibility that others may also be choosing lower numbers. This could help you stay closer to the winning number.",
        "50": "Target Deviation: You've won when your chosen number was very close to the target, and lost when you were off by a small margin. This indicates that the game is quite competitive, and a precise estimation is crucial.",
        "51": "Overestimation or Underestimation: You've lost more often when choosing a number that is higher than the target. This suggests that you might be slightly overestimating the average.",
        "52": "Round Importance: As the game progresses, each round becomes more critical, as players learn from their mistakes and the game dynamics stabilize. Be more precise in your calculations and strategy.",
        "53": "Game Dynamics: Consider the remaining rounds. If there are only a few rounds left, players might be more cautious and try to stay closer to the target, while in earlier rounds, they might be more experimental.",
        "54": "Randomness Factor: There might be some randomness in the choices, so it's essential to balance your strategy with a degree of flexibility.",
        "55": "Learn from Past Trends: The average has been consistently below 2, and players seem to be underestimating the target. This suggests that they might continue to choose lower numbers, potentially causing the average to rise slightly.",
        "56": "Target a Slightly Higher Number: Given the risk management goal, consider choosing a number slightly above the expected average, but not too high to avoid overshooting the target. A number around 0.5 could be a reasonable choice, as it's higher than the recent averages but not too far from the potential target.",
        "57": "Avoid Overconfidence: Even though you've won a few rounds, don't become complacent. The game dynamics can change quickly, and other players might adapt their strategies.",
        "58": "Monitor Extreme Choices: If you suspect that some players might choose 0 or 2, consider how that would affect the average and adjust your choice accordingly.",
        "59": "Adapt to the Game Progress: As the game progresses, the range of numbers that could result in a win narrows. Players might become more conservative, so consider this when making your choice.",
        "60": "Embrace Uncertainty: Given the unpredictability, it's essential to accept that there's a certain level of uncertainty in the game. Focus on making an informed decision based on the available information, but be prepared for unexpected outcomes.",
        "61": "History-based Choice: You could consider choosing a number that is a small increment above the last winning number (1 in Round 8). This could be a conservative strategy, assuming that some players might follow a similar pattern.",
        "62": "Anticipate a Bounce-Back: Since the averages are getting very low, there's a high likelihood that players will start choosing higher numbers in the next round, anticipating a reversal of the trend. This could lead to a sudden increase in the average.",
        "63": "Historical Analysis: Look at the winning numbers in the previous rounds and consider if there's a pattern in how players adjust their choices after a series of losses. This might give you an idea of how they might behave in the next round.",
        "64": "Set a Threshold: Determine a point at which you believe the averages will start increasing again. For example, if you think the averages won't go below 1, you might choose a number slightly above 1 for the next round.",
        "65": "Consider Others' Learning: Players might have learned from their past mistakes and could be adjusting their strategies. If they see a consistent decrease, they might start choosing higher numbers to counteract the trend.",
        "66": "Buffer for Target Calculation: Since the target number is 2/3 of the average, a higher average will result in a higher target. If you anticipate a bounce-back, choose a number that is slightly lower than 2/3 of your estimated higher average to account for the potential increase.",
        "67": "Risk Assessment: Weigh the risk of choosing a higher number against the potential reward. If you believe a reversal is imminent, choosing a higher number might be a calculated risk. However, if you're not confident, it might be safer to stick with a number closer to the current trend.",
        "68": "Adapt to the Situation: Be prepared to adjust your strategy as the game progresses. If the average continues to decrease, you might need to reconsider your anticipation of a bounce-back.",
        "69": "Learn from Others' Mistakes: Analyze the winning numbers and losing numbers in the previous rounds. If you notice a pattern in the choices that led to losses, try to avoid making similar choices.",
        "70": "Adaptation: Given your recent losses, you might want to adjust your strategy slightly. If you think the average will continue to decrease, choose a number slightly below the calculated target to account for the possibility of a lower average. If you think players will choose higher numbers, you might want to choose a number closer to the target.",
        "71": "Track the Trend: The average has been consistently decreasing, but it's important to note that the rate of decrease seems to be slowing down. Observe if this trend continues or if there's a potential for a reversal.",
        "72": "Avoiding Over-Adjustment: As you've observed, over-adjustment has been a factor in your losses. Players might be overreacting to previous rounds' outcomes, causing them to choose numbers that are too low.",
        "73": "Anticipating Others' Behavior: Consider that other players might also be using these guidelines, so be prepared for a potential convergence of choices around a certain range.",
        "74": "Add a Slight Buffer: To account for potential over-adjustment, add a slight buffer to your chosen number. This buffer should be smaller than the difference between the target and the winning number in the previous round.",
        "75": "Consider the Range: Remember that the number must be between 0 and 100. If the average is getting too low, it might be time to consider that players might start choosing higher numbers to avoid going too low.",
        "76": "Learn from Your Mistakes: Analyze why you lost in Rounds 3 and 5. In Round 3, you chose 13, which was above the target but below the winning number. In Round 5, you chose 7, which was above the winning number but still below the target. Adjust your strategy accordingly.",
        "77": "Analyze Recent Outcomes: In the last few rounds, the winning number has been 1 point away from the target. This might suggest that players are slightly underestimating the target. If this pattern continues, choosing a number slightly above the calculated target might be beneficial.",
        "78": "Adapt to Unexpected Changes: Be prepared for deviations from the decreasing trend. If the average doesn't decrease as expected, adjust your choice accordingly.",
        "79": "Final Choice: Given the guidelines above, you might consider choosing a number between 0.35 and 0.45, with a slight bias towards the higher end if you think other players will also choose conservatively.",
        "80": "History of Your Choices: Players might be aware of your recent choices and might adjust accordingly. Be prepared for potential shifts in their behavior based on your past performance.",
        "81": "Flexibility: Be ready to adapt your strategy if the actual average deviates significantly from your prediction. If the average is higher, you might need to choose a higher number, and if it's lower, choose a lower number.",
        "82": "Avoiding Extremes: Given the small numbers, it's crucial to avoid choosing 0 or 1, as these are the extremes and might result in a larger deviation from the target.",
        "83": "Avoiding Extremes: Given that the winning numbers in the previous rounds were close to the target, choose a number that is neither too close to the upper limit (100) nor too close to zero, as these extremes can result in a larger deviation from the target.",
        "84": "Track Trends: Observe the trend of the average number chosen. It seems to be declining, but it might stabilize or fluctuate in the future. Be prepared to adapt to any changes.",
        "85": "Consider Round Context: In the later rounds, players might be more cautious, knowing the trend, which could lead to a higher average or a more concentrated selection around the target. This could affect your decision.",
        "86": "Experiment with Different Strategies: Given the recent streak of losses, it might be beneficial to try a different approach. For example, you could choose a number slightly above the target, especially if you think others are consistently choosing below it.",
        "87": "Buffer Zone: Given the recent rounds, it seems that a buffer of 1-2 points below the target has been successful (e.g., choosing 9 in Round 4 when the target was 6.80). However, be cautious as this might become a predictable pattern for other players.",
        "88": "Avoid Extreme Numbers: Numbers close to 0 or 100 are less likely to be chosen, as they are far from the average. Focus on numbers within the middle range.",
        "89": "Learn from Recent Losses: In Round 12, you chose 2 again, which was a losing strategy. Avoid repeating the same choice if it has proven unsuccessful in the past.",
        "90": "Risk Assessment: Weigh the risk of choosing a number that is too high or too low based on the current game state and the potential reactions of other players.",
        "91": "Range Exploration: Since the average was 32, consider exploring numbers slightly above or below this range to account for potential shifts in player behavior.",
        "92": "Target Range: Calculate the target number for each round and observe that it has also been decreasing. Players who are closer to the target have a higher chance of winning.",
        "93": "Continuing the Trend: Given the decreasing trend, it's reasonable to assume that players will continue to choose lower numbers. However, be cautious as the trend might not always continue indefinitely.",
        "94": "Risk Mitigation: Be aware that if the average doesn't drop as much as expected, choosing too low could result in a larger deviation from the target. Therefore, don't go too far below the estimated target.",
        "95": "Trend Analysis: Keep an eye on the pattern of decreasing average numbers chosen by players and be prepared for potential reversals.",
        "96": "Target Range: Aim for a number that is close to the potential target range, considering a possible increase in the average due to players choosing higher numbers.",
        "97": "Avoid Overconfidence: Adapt the strategy based on the current situation and avoid overconfidence from past successes.",
        "98": "Game Theory: Consider the possibility of a Nash equilibrium if players are becoming more strategic, where no player can improve their outcome by changing their strategy, given the choices of others.",
        "99": "Conservatism: As suggested, be more conservative in your estimation. Given the losses in Round 5 and 6, it seems that choosing a number slightly below the target might be a safer strategy, especially if other players are also adjusting downward.",

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Avoid Over- or Under-Shooting: Since others might be trying to hit the target, avoid choosing a number that is too far from the target, as it could result in a larger deviation.\n - Estimate the Shift: Based on the previous round's outcome, consider how much the average might shift. If players tend to learn from their mistakes, they might move closer to the target, which was 21.33. However, if they overcorrect, the average could shift in the opposite direction.\n - Adapting to Game Dynamics: Since the game is ongoing, you can use the information from Round 1 to inform your decision for Round 2. If you believe that players will be more strategic, you might want to choose a number that is slightly below the estimated target to account for potential overestimation.\n - Risk Management: Be cautious of choosing too far from the target, as it could lead to a larger deviation if the average doesn't change significantly.\n - Consider Range Constraints: Remember that the numbers are constrained between 0 and 100. A very low number could lead to a large deviation if the actual average is higher than anticipated.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

        "185": "Avoiding Extremes: Given the game's mechanics, numbers too close to 0 or 100 are less likely to be the target, as they would result in extreme averages. Players are more likely to choose numbers within a narrower range.",
        "186": "Analyze the Previous Round: The average number chosen in Round 1 was 32. This suggests that players, including yourself, were relatively conservative in their choices, as the winning number was also 32, which is close to the average.",
        "187": "Consider Round-to-Round Variability: Players might adjust their strategies after each round. If they realize that the average was too low in Round 1, they might choose higher numbers in the next round. Conversely, if they think the average was too high, they might choose lower numbers.",
        "188": "Estimate the Shift: Based on the previous round's outcome, consider how much the average might shift. If players tend to learn from their mistakes, they might move closer to the target, which was 21.33. However, if they overcorrect, the average could shift in the opposite direction.",
        "189": "Consider the Target: The target for Round 2 would be 2/3 of the new average. If you expect the average to increase, the target will also increase; if it decreases, the target will decrease.",
        "190": "Anticipate Others' Adjustments: Try to predict how other players might adjust their choices. If they think the target is closer to 21.33, they might choose numbers around that value, but if they think the winning number was 32, they might stick with that or choose slightly higher.",
        "191": "Player Behavior Observation: In Round 1, the average number chosen was 32, which indicates that players might have selected numbers around the middle of the range (0 to 100). This could suggest a conservative or random strategy.",
        "192": "Estimating the Average: Since you don't have information about the specific choices of other players, it's challenging to estimate the next round's average. However, you can consider that players might adjust their strategies after Round 1. If they learned from the win, they might choose numbers closer to the target, which was 21.33.",
        "193": "Adapting to Game Dynamics: Since the game is ongoing, you can use the information from Round 1 to inform your decision for Round 2. If you believe that players will be more strategic, you might want to choose a number that is slightly below the estimated target to account for potential overestimation.",
        "194": "Post-Game Analysis: Reflect on the fact that you won by choosing the exact average in Round 1. This might not happen again, so adjust your strategy accordingly.",
        "195": "Analyze Your Own Strategy: Since you won Round 1 by choosing 32, which was both the average and the target, consider whether this was a lucky choice or a well-calculated one. If you based your choice on a specific strategy, evaluate if it's still relevant for the next round.",
        "196": "Expect Adjustments: Players may now be more aware of the target and might adjust their choices to be closer to 2/3 of the average. This could lead to a lower average in the next round, as players might choose numbers below 32.",
        "197": "Analyze the Trend: The average number chosen by all players has been decreasing from round to round (32, 19, 16.8). This suggests that players might be adjusting their choices to lower numbers, possibly to avoid the target or the winning numbers from previous rounds.",
        "198": "Risk Management: Be cautious of choosing too far from the target, as it could lead to a larger deviation if the average doesn't change significantly.",
        "199": "Range Consideration: Given the range of 0 to 100, ensure your choice is within a reasonable range. If the average is expected to be around 15, numbers between 8 and 12 might be a good range to consider, as they are close to the target but not too close to the previous winning numbers.",
        "200": "Risk Assessment: Weigh the risk of choosing a number that is too close to the target, which might lead to a tie, against choosing a number that is slightly off but less predictable.",
        "201": "Variability: Consider that other players might also be using similar strategies. Be prepared for some unpredictability in their choices, which could result in a different average than expected.",
        "202": "Target Range: Since the target number is 2/3 of the average, a decreasing average will result in a lower target. Players might be more cautious and choose numbers closer to the lower end of the range to minimize the risk of overshooting.",
        "203": "Avoiding Overlap: In Round 4, you chose the same number as the previous round (10), which was too high for the decreasing average. Be mindful of not repeating the same number, especially if you suspect others might also adjust their choices.",
        "204": "Learning from Others: Analyze the choices of other players in previous rounds to identify any patterns or strategies they might be using. This can help you make a more informed decision.",
        "205": "Estimating the Next Average: Given the trend of decreasing averages, you could estimate the next average to be lower than 19, perhaps around 16-17. However, be cautious as players might also choose to stay around the previous average, leading to a similar or slightly higher average.",
        "206": "Target Calculation: Calculate 2/3 of your estimated new average. This will give you the target number for the upcoming round.",
        "207": "Estimate the New Average: Take into account the decreasing average from 32 in Round 1 to 19 in Round 2. Estimate the new average based on this trend and the likelihood of players continuing to choose lower numbers.",
        "208": "Target Deviation: Aim for a number slightly below your estimated average to hedge against others choosing closer to the target. This creates a buffer in case others also adjust their choices downward.",
        "209": "Consider Round Dynamics: Recognize that players might adapt their strategies after each round, potentially learning from your wins and becoming more cautious or strategic in their choices.",
        "210": "Range Analysis: Reflect on the range of numbers chosen in the previous rounds. If the range has narrowed, it might indicate that players are converging on a specific strategy or number range.",
        "211": "Randomness Factor: Acknowledge the potential impact of randomness in the choices made by players, which could affect the average and the target number.",
        "212": "Consider Range Boundaries: Be mindful of the range (0 to 100) and avoid numbers that are too close to the boundaries, as they might result in a larger deviation from the target if the average shifts.",
        "213": "Monitor Player Behavior: If you have observed any patterns in other players' choices, factor that into your decision-making process.",
        "214": "Flexibility: Be prepared to adjust your strategy as the game progresses, based on new information from each round.",
        "215": "Consider the Previous Round's Deviation: The winning number was the average itself (32), which indicates that players might have chosen numbers close to the middle or that there was a lack of coordination. This deviation from the target suggests that players might adjust their strategies in the next round.",
        "216": "Learn from Past Rounds: The last two rounds had winning numbers that were very close to the average. This suggests that players might have been choosing numbers around the middle, or they might not have been coordinating their choices.",
        "217": "Estimate a Lower Average: Given the symmetry avoidance, consider that the average might be lower than in the previous rounds. Players might choose numbers in the range of 10-20 to push the average down.",
        "218": "Consider Range Constraints: Remember that the numbers are constrained between 0 and 100. A very low number could lead to a large deviation if the actual average is higher than anticipated.",
        "219": "Avoid Extreme Numbers: Numbers too close to 0 or 100 are riskier, as they can result in a larger deviation from the target if the average is not as low as expected.",
        "220": "Monitor the Range: Keep in mind the range of numbers (0 to 100) and ensure your choice doesn't fall outside a reasonable range that other players might consider.",
        "221": "Trend Analysis: Keep an eye on whether the decreasing trend in average numbers continues or if there's a potential for a reversal.",
        "222": "Avoiding Overcorrection: Be cautious of overcorrecting and choosing a number too far from the current trend, considering the possibility that other players might anticipate recent patterns.",
        "223": "Range Estimation: Given the current average is around 1.8, consider that players might choose numbers around this value to stay close to the target. The target number for this round would be around 1.2.",
        "224": "Risk vs. Reward: Consider the potential impact of choosing 1 or 2, weighing the safety of choosing 1 against the risk and potential reward of choosing 2.",
        "225": "Behavioral Psychology: Consider the potential influence of recent outcomes on players' choices and the clustering of numbers around the target.",
        "226": "History of Winning Numbers: Take into account the history of winning numbers, particularly the recent trend of the winning number being 1, and assess whether choosing 1 is still the best strategy.",
        "227": "Randomness: Acknowledge the potential impact of randomness in the choices due to the small range of numbers, and consider making a small adjustment from the previous winning number as a strategy.",
        "228": "Anticipating Others' Anticipation: Consider that other players might also be thinking about the target and adjusting their choices accordingly. Try to predict how they might adjust their strategies based on this knowledge.",
        "229": "Coordination or Cooperation (if possible): If there is an opportunity for communication or collaboration, attempt to coordinate with other players to choose numbers that would result in a specific average, making it easier to hit the target.",
        "230": "Post-Game Analysis: After each round, review the results to refine your understanding of the game and improve your strategy for future rounds."
