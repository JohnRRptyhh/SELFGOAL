          "content": "\n\nYou are participating in a game played by 5 players over 20 rounds.\n\nGame Rules:\n\n1. Each player selects an integer number between 0 and 100, inclusive.\n2. After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-The historical data from Round 1 indicates that the average number chosen by all players was 27.6, and the target number was 2/3 of this average, which is 18.40. The winning number, which was closest to the target, was also 2.0, and I, as player_0, chose 2.0, thus winning the round.\n\nA possible reason for failure or phrasing discrepancy in this context could be a lack of information about the other players' strategies or numbers chosen. Since the game is played over multiple rounds, it's crucial to consider how other players might adapt their choices based on previous outcomes.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan for future rounds would be to adopt a more strategic approach. I should consider the range of numbers that could result in a target number closer to my chosen number. Additionally, I should anticipate potential shifts in the average due to strategic changes by other players. If others are likely to adjust upwards after a low average in the first round, I might choose a slightly higher number to stay close to the 2/3 target of the expected new average.\nReflections:\n-In Round 1, I successfully won by choosing 2.0, which was very close to the target number of 18.40. However, in Round 2, I chose 20.0, which was significantly higher than the target number of 13.20. The failure in Round 2 might be attributed to overestimating the average number chosen by the players, resulting in a choice that was too far from the target.\n\nTo mitigate this failure in future rounds, I should adopt a more conservative strategy and consider the tendency for players to choose numbers closer to zero, as seen in Round 1. A high-level plan would be to choose a number slightly below the previous round's target, assuming players will continue to select numbers around the lower end of the range. This strategy aims to keep my selection closer to the expected 2/3 of the average while accounting for potential underestimates by other players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it seems that my choices have been consistently farther away from the target number. In Round 1, I won by choosing 2.0, which was very close to the target of 18.40 due to a fortunate coincidence. However, in Rounds 2 and 3, my choices were not well-calibrated. In Round 2, I chose 20.0 when the target was 13.20, and in Round 3, I chose 14.0 when the target was 12.40. This suggests that I need to improve my estimation of the average number chosen by all players.\n\nNew High Level Plan:\nTo better predict the target, I should adopt a more strategic approach to estimating the average. I will consider the tendency of players to gravitate towards certain numbers, such as round numbers or numbers near the middle of the range (e.g., 50). I will also track the average chosen number across rounds and adjust my choice to be closer to 2/3 of this moving average. This should increase the likelihood of my selection being closer to the target number.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that I have been consistently choosing numbers that are either too high or too far from the target. In Round 1, I won by choosing a very low number, but in subsequent rounds, my choices were not well-calibrated to the target. The target is 2/3 of the average, so a strategy of selecting a number slightly below the average might be more successful, as other players might also choose numbers around or above the average, driving the actual average up.\n\nNew High Level Plan:\nTo improve my chances of winning, I should aim to choose a number slightly below the historical average of player selections, considering that other players might also be using a similar strategy. This should help me get closer to the target, which is 2/3 of the actual average. Additionally, I should monitor the tendency of other players' choices over time and adjust my strategy accordingly, becoming more conservative or aggressive if the average consistently shifts above or below the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have consistently been either too low or too high compared to the target number. In Round 1, I won by choosing a very low number, but in subsequent rounds, I overestimated the target. The main issue seems to be an inaccurate estimation of the average number chosen by all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy. I will start by considering the average of the previous round's chosen numbers as a basis for my prediction. If the average is increasing or decreasing, I will adjust my choice accordingly, aiming to stay closer to the 2/3 mark. Additionally, I should account for the potential influence of my own choice on the average and try to predict how other players might reason about the target. This will require estimating the range of numbers other players might select and finding a value within that range that is closest to 2/3 of the expected average.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have consistently been either too high or too low compared to the target number. In Round 1, I won by choosing a very low number, but in subsequent rounds, I overestimated the target, selecting numbers above the actual target. This suggests a lack of accurate estimation of the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy. I will start by considering the tendency of players to gravitate towards the middle of the range (around 50) in the absence of specific information. As the game progresses and I gather more data on the average chosen by players, I can adjust my choice accordingly. If the average is consistently below 50, I should lean towards lower numbers, and if it's above, I should choose higher. Additionally, I should aim to stay closer to the target by calculating a more precise estimate of 2/3 of the average, rather than relying on intuition. This new approach should increase my chances of selecting a number closer to the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that I have been consistently choosing numbers that are either too low or too high compared to the target number. In Round 1, I won by choosing a very low number, but in subsequent rounds, my choices were either above or below the target by a significant margin. This suggests a lack of accurate estimation of the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. I should consider the tendency of other players to choose numbers around the middle range, given that the game encourages players to think of the average. A high-level plan would be to initially lean towards choosing numbers slightly below the middle range (around 30-40) to account for potential overestimation by others. As the game progresses and I gather more information about other players' tendencies, I can adjust my choice accordingly, always keeping in mind the target is 2/3 of the average. This adaptive strategy should improve my chances of selecting a number closer to the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that I have been consistently choosing numbers that are either too low or too high compared to the target number. In Round 1, I won by choosing a very low number, but in subsequent rounds, my choices were either above or slightly below the target, causing me to lose. The main issue seems to be an inaccurate estimation of the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. I will start by considering the trend of the average numbers chosen by players, which seems to be decreasing round by round. I should also factor in the possibility of other players using similar strategies. A good high-level plan would be to choose a number slightly below the arithmetic mean of the previous round's target and winning number, as this might account for a potential shift in the average due to strategic adjustments from other players. Additionally, I should be prepared to adjust my strategy if the game dynamics change significantly.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been either too high or too low compared to the target number. In the early rounds, I tended to choose numbers far from the target, which led to losses. In later rounds, I adjusted my strategy and chose numbers closer to the target, resulting in wins. A possible reason for the discrepancy is that I didn't initially anticipate the clustering of numbers around the average, which is crucial for accurately predicting the target.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more data-driven approach. I will start by analyzing the tendency of players to choose numbers around the average, and consider the distribution of numbers in previous rounds. If players tend to choose numbers close to the average, I should aim for a number slightly below 2/3 of the average to account for the potential overestimation. Additionally, I should adjust my choice dynamically based on the game's progression, as players might change their strategy over time. This adaptive strategy should increase the likelihood of choosing a number closer to the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been either too high or too low compared to the target number. In rounds where the target was around the middle of the 0 to 100 range, I tended to choose numbers closer to the extremes, leading to losses. A possible reason for this is an overestimation of the average number chosen by other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy. I should consider the trend of the averages and target numbers from previous rounds and adjust my choice accordingly. If the averages have been consistently low, I should lean towards choosing a number closer to the target. Additionally, since the target is 2/3 of the average, choosing a number that is slightly below the expected average might be beneficial, as it accounts for the possibility of other players also choosing numbers above the average. This new plan should help me better predict the target and improve my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been too high compared to the target number, which is 2/3 of the average. In rounds where the average was below 15, my selections were generally closer to the target, but in rounds with higher averages, I tended to choose numbers that were significantly above the target. This suggests a need for better estimation of the average number chosen by players.\n\nNew High Level Plan:\n1. Observe the trend in average numbers chosen by players. If the average is increasing or decreasing round by round, adjust my choice accordingly.\n2. Consider selecting numbers slightly below the calculated target, as other players might also overestimate and push the average up.\n3. In rounds with averages above 15, be more conservative in my choice to avoid overshooting the target.\n4. After the first few rounds, if possible, analyze the playing style of other participants to anticipate their choices and adjust my strategy.\n5. Regularly reassess the effectiveness of the strategy and make refinements based on new data.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been either too high or too low compared to the target number. In the early rounds, I tended to choose numbers far from the target, likely because I was not yet familiar with the average numbers chosen by other players. In later rounds, while I occasionally won by selecting numbers close to the target, I still lost when my choice was slightly off.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. I should consider the trend of the average numbers chosen by players, which seems to be decreasing over time. Additionally, I need to account for the fact that my choice affects the average, so I should try to predict what other players might choose and adjust my number accordingly to stay close to 2/3 of the expected average. A high-level plan would be to initially lean towards lower numbers, as players might be more likely to choose higher numbers, and then adapt my choice as the game progresses and the average shifts. This adaptive strategy should increase my chances of selecting a number closer to the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been too high compared to the target number. In rounds where the average was below 15, I tended to choose numbers around 10 or higher, which led to losses. To improve, I should adopt a more conservative strategy, leaning towards lower numbers. My new plan is to choose a number that is slightly below 2/3 of my estimated average, considering that other players might also choose higher numbers, pushing the actual average up. This should increase the chances of being closer to the target number.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my strategy has been inconsistent, often choosing numbers that are either too high or too low compared to the target. In the early rounds, I tended to choose numbers closer to the upper limit (100), while in later rounds, I shifted towards choosing smaller numbers. This inconsistency might be due to not accurately predicting the average number chosen by all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive approach. I should consider the trend of the average numbers chosen by players and adjust my selection accordingly. If the averages are generally increasing or decreasing, I should lean towards numbers closer to the trend. Additionally, I should maintain a buffer around the 2/3 mark to account for potential fluctuations in the average. This way, I can better anticipate the target number and increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been too high compared to the target number, which is 2/3 of the average. In several rounds, I chose numbers around 10 or higher, while the winning numbers were typically in the single digits or just above. This suggests that I need to adjust my strategy to select numbers that are closer to the lower end of the range, considering that other players might also be choosing low numbers to stay close to the target.\n\nNew High Level Plan:\nTo improve my performance, I will adopt a more conservative approach and choose numbers closer to 0, while still considering the potential range of numbers other players might select. This should help me stay closer to the 2/3 average target, especially in situations where the average is low. Additionally, I will analyze the trend of the decreasing averages and try to anticipate when a higher number might be more advantageous due to potential increases in other players' selections.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my strategy has been inconsistent, often choosing numbers that are either too high or too low compared to the target. In the early rounds, I tended to choose numbers closer to the extremes (e.g., 2.0 and 20.0), while in later rounds, I gravitated towards the middle (e.g., 3.0 and 5.0). This inconsistency likely led to losses when the target was closer to the other end of the range.\n\nTo improve, I should adopt a more systematic approach. One such plan is to initially estimate the average number chosen by players based on the historical data, which seems to hover around 10.0. Given that the target is 2/3 of this average, I should aim to select a number slightly above or below 6.67, depending on the trend of the averages in recent rounds. If the averages have been decreasing, I should lean towards a lower number, and if they've been increasing, I should choose slightly higher. This strategy should increase my chances of being closer to the target number.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been too high compared to the target number, which is 2/3 of the average. In several rounds, I chose numbers around 10 or higher, while the winning numbers were typically in the single digits or just above. This suggests that I need to adjust my strategy to select numbers that are consistently lower than the average to be closer to the target.\n\nNew High Level Plan:\nTo improve my performance, I will aim to choose numbers that are slightly below the average of the previous rounds, considering that players might also be trying to stay close to the target. This strategy should help me stay closer to the 2/3 average target, as it accounts for the potential collective tendency to choose numbers on the lower end. Additionally, I will consider the trend in the averages and adjust my choice accordingly, expecting the average to decrease or increase based on the game's progression.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been too high or too low compared to the target number. This is likely due to an inconsistent strategy and underestimating or overestimating the average number chosen by other players. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more systematic approach. A new plan would be to calculate the moving average of the target numbers over the last few rounds and choose a number slightly below this average to account for the potential increase in average numbers chosen by other players as the game progresses. This should improve my chances of selecting a number closer to the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been too high compared to the target number, which is 2/3 of the average. This is particularly evident in rounds where the average was below 10. In these instances, choosing numbers closer to the lower end of the range would have been more advantageous. To improve, I should adopt a strategy that leans towards the lower end of the number spectrum, especially when the average is low. As the game progresses and I gather more information about the tendencies of other players, I can adjust my choices accordingly to better estimate the average and thus the target number.\n\n```"

      "learnings": "Reflections:\n-The historical data from Round 1 indicates that the average number chosen by all players was 27.6, and the target number was 2/3 of this average, which is 18.40. The winning number, which was closest to the target, was also 2.0, and I, as player_0, chose 2.0, thus winning the round.\n\nA possible reason for failure or phrasing discrepancy in this context could be a lack of information about the other players' strategies or numbers chosen. Since the game is played over multiple rounds, it's crucial to consider how other players might adapt their choices based on previous outcomes.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan for future rounds would be to adopt a more strategic approach. I should consider the range of numbers that could result in a target number closer to my chosen number. Additionally, I should anticipate potential shifts in the average due to strategic changes by other players. If others are likely to adjust upwards after a low average in the first round, I might choose a slightly higher number to stay close to the 2/3 target of the expected new average.\nReflections:\n-In Round 1, I successfully won by choosing 2.0, which was very close to the target number of 18.40. However, in Round 2, I chose 20.0, which was significantly higher than the target number of 13.20. The failure in Round 2 might be attributed to overestimating the average number chosen by the players, resulting in a choice that was too far from the target.\n\nTo mitigate this failure in future rounds, I should adopt a more conservative strategy and consider the tendency for players to choose numbers closer to zero, as seen in Round 1. A high-level plan would be to choose a number slightly below the previous round's target, assuming players will continue to select numbers around the lower end of the range. This strategy aims to keep my selection closer to the expected 2/3 of the average while accounting for potential underestimates by other players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it seems that my choices have been consistently farther away from the target number. In Round 1, I won by choosing 2.0, which was very close to the target of 18.40 due to a fortunate coincidence. However, in Rounds 2 and 3, my choices were not well-calibrated. In Round 2, I chose 20.0 when the target was 13.20, and in Round 3, I chose 14.0 when the target was 12.40. This suggests that I need to improve my estimation of the average number chosen by all players.\n\nNew High Level Plan:\nTo better predict the target, I should adopt a more strategic approach to estimating the average. I will consider the tendency of players to gravitate towards certain numbers, such as round numbers or numbers near the middle of the range (e.g., 50). I will also track the average chosen number across rounds and adjust my choice to be closer to 2/3 of this moving average. This should increase the likelihood of my selection being closer to the target number.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that I have been consistently choosing numbers that are either too high or too far from the target. In Round 1, I won by choosing a very low number, but in subsequent rounds, my choices were not well-calibrated to the target. The target is 2/3 of the average, so a strategy of selecting a number slightly below the average might be more successful, as other players might also choose numbers around or above the average, driving the actual average up.\n\nNew High Level Plan:\nTo improve my chances of winning, I should aim to choose a number slightly below the historical average of player selections, considering that other players might also be using a similar strategy. This should help me get closer to the target, which is 2/3 of the actual average. Additionally, I should monitor the tendency of other players' choices over time and adjust my strategy accordingly, becoming more conservative or aggressive if the average consistently shifts above or below the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have consistently been either too low or too high compared to the target number. In Round 1, I won by choosing a very low number, but in subsequent rounds, I overestimated the target. The main issue seems to be an inaccurate estimation of the average number chosen by all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy. I will start by considering the average of the previous round's chosen numbers as a basis for my prediction. If the average is increasing or decreasing, I will adjust my choice accordingly, aiming to stay closer to the 2/3 mark. Additionally, I should account for the potential influence of my own choice on the average and try to predict how other players might reason about the target. This will require estimating the range of numbers other players might select and finding a value within that range that is closest to 2/3 of the expected average.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have consistently been either too high or too low compared to the target number. In Round 1, I won by choosing a very low number, but in subsequent rounds, I overestimated the target, selecting numbers above the actual target. This suggests a lack of accurate estimation of the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy. I will start by considering the tendency of players to gravitate towards the middle of the range (around 50) in the absence of specific information. As the game progresses and I gather more data on the average chosen by players, I can adjust my choice accordingly. If the average is consistently below 50, I should lean towards lower numbers, and if it's above, I should choose higher. Additionally, I should aim to stay closer to the target by calculating a more precise estimate of 2/3 of the average, rather than relying on intuition. This new approach should increase my chances of selecting a number closer to the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that I have been consistently choosing numbers that are either too low or too high compared to the target number. In Round 1, I won by choosing a very low number, but in subsequent rounds, my choices were either above or below the target by a significant margin. This suggests a lack of accurate estimation of the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. I should consider the tendency of other players to choose numbers around the middle range, given that the game encourages players to think of the average. A high-level plan would be to initially lean towards choosing numbers slightly below the middle range (around 30-40) to account for potential overestimation by others. As the game progresses and I gather more information about other players' tendencies, I can adjust my choice accordingly, always keeping in mind the target is 2/3 of the average. This adaptive strategy should improve my chances of selecting a number closer to the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that I have been consistently choosing numbers that are either too low or too high compared to the target number. In Round 1, I won by choosing a very low number, but in subsequent rounds, my choices were either above or slightly below the target, causing me to lose. The main issue seems to be an inaccurate estimation of the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. I will start by considering the trend of the average numbers chosen by players, which seems to be decreasing round by round. I should also factor in the possibility of other players using similar strategies. A good high-level plan would be to choose a number slightly below the arithmetic mean of the previous round's target and winning number, as this might account for a potential shift in the average due to strategic adjustments from other players. Additionally, I should be prepared to adjust my strategy if the game dynamics change significantly.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been either too high or too low compared to the target number. In the early rounds, I tended to choose numbers far from the target, which led to losses. In later rounds, I adjusted my strategy and chose numbers closer to the target, resulting in wins. A possible reason for the discrepancy is that I didn't initially anticipate the clustering of numbers around the average, which is crucial for accurately predicting the target.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more data-driven approach. I will start by analyzing the tendency of players to choose numbers around the average, and consider the distribution of numbers in previous rounds. If players tend to choose numbers close to the average, I should aim for a number slightly below 2/3 of the average to account for the potential overestimation. Additionally, I should adjust my choice dynamically based on the game's progression, as players might change their strategy over time. This adaptive strategy should increase the likelihood of choosing a number closer to the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been either too high or too low compared to the target number. In rounds where the target was around the middle of the 0 to 100 range, I tended to choose numbers closer to the extremes, leading to losses. A possible reason for this is an overestimation of the average number chosen by other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy. I should consider the trend of the averages and target numbers from previous rounds and adjust my choice accordingly. If the averages have been consistently low, I should lean towards choosing a number closer to the target. Additionally, since the target is 2/3 of the average, choosing a number that is slightly below the expected average might be beneficial, as it accounts for the possibility of other players also choosing numbers above the average. This new plan should help me better predict the target and improve my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been too high compared to the target number, which is 2/3 of the average. In rounds where the average was below 15, my selections were generally closer to the target, but in rounds with higher averages, I tended to choose numbers that were significantly above the target. This suggests a need for better estimation of the average number chosen by players.\n\nNew High Level Plan:\n1. Observe the trend in average numbers chosen by players. If the average is increasing or decreasing round by round, adjust my choice accordingly.\n2. Consider selecting numbers slightly below the calculated target, as other players might also overestimate and push the average up.\n3. In rounds with averages above 15, be more conservative in my choice to avoid overshooting the target.\n4. After the first few rounds, if possible, analyze the playing style of other participants to anticipate their choices and adjust my strategy.\n5. Regularly reassess the effectiveness of the strategy and make refinements based on new data.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been either too high or too low compared to the target number. In the early rounds, I tended to choose numbers far from the target, likely because I was not yet familiar with the average numbers chosen by other players. In later rounds, while I occasionally won by selecting numbers close to the target, I still lost when my choice was slightly off.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. I should consider the trend of the average numbers chosen by players, which seems to be decreasing over time. Additionally, I need to account for the fact that my choice affects the average, so I should try to predict what other players might choose and adjust my number accordingly to stay close to 2/3 of the expected average. A high-level plan would be to initially lean towards lower numbers, as players might be more likely to choose higher numbers, and then adapt my choice as the game progresses and the average shifts. This adaptive strategy should increase my chances of selecting a number closer to the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been too high compared to the target number. In rounds where the average was below 15, I tended to choose numbers around 10 or higher, which led to losses. To improve, I should adopt a more conservative strategy, leaning towards lower numbers. My new plan is to choose a number that is slightly below 2/3 of my estimated average, considering that other players might also choose higher numbers, pushing the actual average up. This should increase the chances of being closer to the target number.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my strategy has been inconsistent, often choosing numbers that are either too high or too low compared to the target. In the early rounds, I tended to choose numbers closer to the upper limit (100), while in later rounds, I shifted towards choosing smaller numbers. This inconsistency might be due to not accurately predicting the average number chosen by all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive approach. I should consider the trend of the average numbers chosen by players and adjust my selection accordingly. If the averages are generally increasing or decreasing, I should lean towards numbers closer to the trend. Additionally, I should maintain a buffer around the 2/3 mark to account for potential fluctuations in the average. This way, I can better anticipate the target number and increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been too high compared to the target number, which is 2/3 of the average. In several rounds, I chose numbers around 10 or higher, while the winning numbers were typically in the single digits or just above. This suggests that I need to adjust my strategy to select numbers that are closer to the lower end of the range, considering that other players might also be choosing low numbers to stay close to the target.\n\nNew High Level Plan:\nTo improve my performance, I will adopt a more conservative approach and choose numbers closer to 0, while still considering the potential range of numbers other players might select. This should help me stay closer to the 2/3 average target, especially in situations where the average is low. Additionally, I will analyze the trend of the decreasing averages and try to anticipate when a higher number might be more advantageous due to potential increases in other players' selections.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my strategy has been inconsistent, often choosing numbers that are either too high or too low compared to the target. In the early rounds, I tended to choose numbers closer to the extremes (e.g., 2.0 and 20.0), while in later rounds, I gravitated towards the middle (e.g., 3.0 and 5.0). This inconsistency likely led to losses when the target was closer to the other end of the range.\n\nTo improve, I should adopt a more systematic approach. One such plan is to initially estimate the average number chosen by players based on the historical data, which seems to hover around 10.0. Given that the target is 2/3 of this average, I should aim to select a number slightly above or below 6.67, depending on the trend of the averages in recent rounds. If the averages have been decreasing, I should lean towards a lower number, and if they've been increasing, I should choose slightly higher. This strategy should increase my chances of being closer to the target number.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been too high compared to the target number, which is 2/3 of the average. In several rounds, I chose numbers around 10 or higher, while the winning numbers were typically in the single digits or just above. This suggests that I need to adjust my strategy to select numbers that are consistently lower than the average to be closer to the target.\n\nNew High Level Plan:\nTo improve my performance, I will aim to choose numbers that are slightly below the average of the previous rounds, considering that players might also be trying to stay close to the target. This strategy should help me stay closer to the 2/3 average target, as it accounts for the potential collective tendency to choose numbers on the lower end. Additionally, I will consider the trend in the averages and adjust my choice accordingly, expecting the average to decrease or increase based on the game's progression.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been too high or too low compared to the target number. This is likely due to an inconsistent strategy and underestimating or overestimating the average number chosen by other players. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more systematic approach. A new plan would be to calculate the moving average of the target numbers over the last few rounds and choose a number slightly below this average to account for the potential increase in average numbers chosen by other players as the game progresses. This should improve my chances of selecting a number closer to the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been too high compared to the target number, which is 2/3 of the average. This is particularly evident in rounds where the average was below 10. In these instances, choosing numbers closer to the lower end of the range would have been more advantageous. To improve, I should adopt a strategy that leans towards the lower end of the number spectrum, especially when the average is low. As the game progresses and I gather more information about the tendencies of other players, I can adjust my choices accordingly to better estimate the average and thus the target number.\n",

          "content": "\n\nYou are participating in a game played by 5 players over 20 rounds.\n\nGame Rules:\n\n1. Each player selects an integer number between 0 and 100, inclusive.\n2. After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure in Round 1 is that my chosen number, 67.0, was significantly higher than the target number, 18.40. This indicates that I overestimated the average number that the players, including myself, would select. The discrepancy might stem from not considering the conservative nature of the game, where players might choose numbers closer to zero to minimize the risk of going over the target.\n\nNew High Level Plan:\nFor future rounds, I will adopt a more conservative strategy, aiming to choose numbers closer to zero while still considering the potential for other players to choose higher values. I will estimate a slightly higher average than Round 1, say around 30, and then select a number that is 2/3 of this estimated average to be closer to the actual target. This approach will balance the risk of choosing too high or too low, increasing the chances of being closer to the actual target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it seems that in both rounds, my chosen numbers were significantly different from the target number. In Round 1, I chose 67.0, which was much higher than the target of 18.40, and in Round 2, I chose 22.0, which was above the target of 13.20 but closer. The failure likely stems from overestimating the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I need to adopt a more conservative strategy. A high-level plan would be to initially choose numbers closer to 0, as players might be inclined to choose higher numbers thinking others will do the same, causing the average to be higher than expected. As the game progresses and more information about players' tendencies is available, I can adjust my strategy accordingly, aiming to stay within a smaller range around the predicted 2/3 of the average. This approach should increase the chances of selecting a number closer to the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that in the first two rounds, I chose numbers that were significantly higher than the target. In Round 1, I selected 67.0, which was far above the target of 18.40, and in Round 2, I chose 22.0, which was also higher than the target of 13.20. This suggests a tendency to overestimate the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan is to adopt a more conservative strategy and aim for a number slightly below the average. Since the target is 2/3 of the average, choosing a number slightly below the average will increase the chances of being closer to 2/3 of that average. Additionally, I should consider the distribution of numbers from previous rounds to better estimate where the average might fall. If players tend to choose higher numbers, I should adjust downward more aggressively, and vice versa.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that in the first two rounds, I chose numbers that were significantly higher than the target. In Round 1, I selected 67.0, which was far above the target of 18.40, and in Round 2, I chose 22.0, which was also higher than the target of 13.20. This suggests that I overestimated the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more conservative strategy and aim for numbers closer to the lower end of the range, considering that players might be inclined to choose smaller numbers to stay closer to the 2/3 average target. A high-level plan would be to initially select numbers around 10 or slightly below, as this could place me closer to the expected target. As the game progresses and I gather more information about the players' tendencies, I can adjust my strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that in the first round, I chose a number significantly higher than the target, and in the second round, I chose a number that was above the target but closer. However, in the following rounds, I won by selecting numbers that were either equal to or slightly above the target. The failure in the initial rounds seems to stem from overestimating the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan is to adopt a more conservative approach in my number selection. I should aim to choose numbers that are slightly below the midpoint of the 0 to 100 range, considering that players might tend to choose numbers around the middle. This strategy should place my selection closer to the potential average and, consequently, the target. Additionally, I should adjust my choice based on the trend of previous rounds, leaning towards the numbers that have been closer to the target in recent rounds.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that in the first two rounds, I chose numbers that were significantly higher than the target. In Round 1, I selected 67.0, which was far above the target of 18.40, and in Round 2, I chose 22.0, which was also higher than the target of 13.20. This suggests that I initially overestimated the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more conservative strategy and aim for numbers closer to the lower end of the range, considering that players might be inclined to choose smaller numbers to stay closer to the 2/3 target. A high-level plan would be to initially select numbers around 30-40, as this range seems to be closer to the calculated averages and targets observed in the early rounds. As the game progresses and more data is available, I can refine my strategy based on the evolving patterns of the average numbers chosen by all players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my initial strategy of choosing numbers close to the middle of the range (67.0 in Round 1 and 22.0 in Round 2) led to losses because the other players were selecting numbers closer to the target, resulting in a lower average. In the subsequent rounds, when I chose numbers closer to the calculated target, I won. However, in Round 7, my choice of 9.0 was still slightly above the target of 6.53, causing me to lose again.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy. I should consider the tendency of players to choose numbers below the average to get closer to the target, which is 2/3 of the average. My new plan is to estimate a lower bound for the average based on the assumption that other players will also be strategic. By selecting a number slightly above this estimated lower bound, I aim to be closer to the target while accounting for potential underestimations by other players. This approach should increase my chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my initial strategy of choosing numbers around the middle range (67.0, 22.0) was too high compared to the averages, causing me to lose in the early rounds. In the following rounds, I adjusted my strategy to select numbers closer to or equal to the target, which led to wins in Rounds 3-6. However, in Rounds 7 and 8, my choices were still slightly above the target, resulting in losses.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the trend of decreasing average numbers chosen by players. I should aim to select numbers slightly below the calculated target, considering that other players might also be adjusting their choices towards the lower end to approach the target. This new plan involves more anticipation of the collective behavior and adjusting my choice accordingly.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my initial strategy of choosing numbers around the middle range (67.0, 22.0) was too high compared to the actual averages, leading to losses in the first two rounds. In the following rounds, I adjusted my choices to be closer to the averages, which resulted in wins when my selections were near the target number. However, in Round 7, I slightly underestimated the target, and in Round 8, I overestimated it, both resulting in losses.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the trend of decreasing average numbers chosen by players. I should aim to select numbers that are slightly below the average, considering that players might also be adjusting downwards. This way, I can better approximate the 2/3 target, especially since the target is a fraction of the average, which would likely be lower as players learn from previous rounds. Additionally, I should account for the potential clustering of numbers around the target, and try to choose a number slightly below it to have a better chance of being the closest.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my initial strategy of choosing numbers close to the middle of the range (67.0 in Round 1 and 22.0 in Round 2) led to significant deviations from the target number. In subsequent rounds, I adjusted my choices to be closer to the target, which resulted in wins when my chosen number was near the winning number. However, in Rounds 7 and 8, I slightly overestimated the target, choosing 9.0 and 8.0 respectively, while the winning numbers were 8.0 and 6.0.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the trend of the average numbers chosen by players. I should aim to select a number that is slightly below the calculated target, considering that other players might also be adjusting their choices towards the target. This approach should increase the chances of being closer to the actual winning number. Additionally, I should be more cautious when the target is near the lower end of the range, as small deviations can lead to larger differences from the winning number.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice of numbers has been inconsistent with the target number. In rounds where I won, my chosen number was either the target number itself or very close to it. However, in the rounds I lost, I either overestimated or underestimated the target, which is 2/3 of the average. A possible reason for failure is not accurately predicting the average number chosen by all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. I should consider that other players might also be using a strategy to choose numbers around the 2/3 target. A high-level plan would be to choose numbers slightly below the expected 2/3 of the average, anticipating that the average might be pulled up by other players' strategic choices. This way, even if the average is higher than anticipated, my number would still be closer to the target. Additionally, I should monitor the trend of the average chosen numbers over previous rounds to adjust my strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my initial strategy of choosing numbers around the middle range (67.0 in Round 1 and 22.0 in Round 2) led to losses, as the actual averages were much lower. In subsequent rounds, I adjusted my choices to be closer to the target, which resulted in more wins. However, there were instances (Round 7 and 8) where I slightly overestimated the target, choosing 9.0 and 8.0, respectively, when the winning numbers were 8.0 and 6.0.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the decreasing trend in average numbers chosen by players. I should aim to select numbers closer to the lower end of the range, around 2/3 of the current average, and be more precise in estimating the target. This can be achieved by considering the tendency for players to choose lower numbers over time, as seen in the game log, and adjusting my choice accordingly. Additionally, I should be more cautious when the target is near a whole number, as players might cluster around that number, leading to a slightly lower actual target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my initial strategy of choosing numbers close to the middle of the range (67.0 in Round 1 and 22.0 in Round 2) led to losses because the actual averages were much lower. As the game progressed, I adapted and started choosing numbers closer to the target, which resulted in more wins. However, there were instances (like Round 7 and 8) where I slightly overestimated the target, leading to losses.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should develop a more data-driven approach. I should consider the trend of decreasing average numbers chosen by players and try to predict this trend for the next round. Additionally, I should account for the fact that players might also be adjusting their choices, potentially clustering around the target. A new high-level plan would be to calculate a moving average of the previous few rounds' averages, then aim for a number slightly below that average to anticipate other players' potential convergence on the target. This strategy should improve my chances of being closer to the 2/3 target of the actual average.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my initial strategy of choosing numbers around the middle of the range (67.0 in Round 1, 22.0 in Round 2, and 9.0 in Round 7) led to losses, as I was not accurately predicting the average chosen by other players. In contrast, when I chose numbers closer to the target or the lower end of the range (12.0, 11.0, 10.0, 8.0, 5.0, 3.0, 2.67, and 2.0), I won more rounds. This suggests that a more successful strategy would be to lean towards selecting numbers that are slightly below the expected average, considering that 2/3 of the average tends to be a lower value.\n\nNew High Level Plan:\nTo improve my performance, I will adopt a strategy of estimating a slightly lower-than-average number, taking into account the tendency of other players to choose numbers around the middle of the range. I will also consider the historical data, which shows a decreasing trend in the average chosen number, and adjust my choice accordingly. If the average continues to decrease, I might choose even lower numbers, but always keeping in mind the target number and the potential range of other players' selections.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice of numbers has been inconsistent with the target. In some rounds, I chose numbers that were too high, while in others, I was too low. This inconsistency could be due to not accurately predicting the average number chosen by all players. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach, such as trying to predict the average by considering the range of numbers players are likely to select. A high level plan would be to choose a number around the median of the possible range (50) when the average is unknown, and adjust based on the observed averages from previous rounds. This should help me stay closer to the target, which is 2/3 of the average. Additionally, I should consider the tendency of other players to adjust their choices based on previous rounds, and factor that into my decision-making.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my initial strategy of choosing numbers around the middle range (67.0, 22.0, 9.0, 8.0) was not effective, as the target number tends to be lower due to the 2/3 multiplier. In rounds where I won, I chose numbers closer to the target, often selecting the winning number itself (12.0, 11.0, 10.0, 8.0, 5.0, 3.0, 2.67, 2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 3.0). The failure in rounds 7, 8, 10, and 15 can be attributed to underestimating the target or not adjusting for the decreasing averages.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy: start by choosing numbers closer to the lower end of the range (around 10-20), and as the game progresses and averages decrease, adjust my choice to be closer to 2/3 of the current average. This approach should increase the likelihood of selecting a number closer to the target. Additionally, I should pay attention to the tendency of other players to choose lower numbers, which could drive the average down further.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice of numbers has been inconsistent with the target number. In some rounds, I chose numbers that were too high, while in others, I was too low. This inconsistency can be attributed to not accurately predicting the average number chosen by all players. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach by considering the trend of the average numbers chosen and adjusting my selection accordingly. A potential plan is to choose a number slightly below the arithmetic mean of the previous winning numbers, as this might help me stay closer to the target number which is 2/3 of the average. Additionally, I should account for the possibility of other players using similar strategies and adjust my choice accordingly to anticipate a shift in the average.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice of numbers has been inconsistent, often being too high when the average is higher and too low when the average is lower. This suggests a lack of a systematic strategy in predicting the target number. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more data-driven approach. A new plan could be to calculate the moving average of the target numbers over the last few rounds and choose a number slightly below this moving average, anticipating that players might slightly overestimate the average. This strategy accounts for the tendency of players to cluster their choices around certain numbers, which affects the actual average and, consequently, the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice of numbers has been inconsistent, often selecting numbers that are either too high or too low compared to the target. In some rounds, I accurately predicted the target, while in others, I overestimated or underestimated it. A possible reason for failure is not adequately accounting for the potential range of numbers other players might choose and how that would affect the average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. I should consider the trend of the average chosen numbers and target numbers over the previous rounds and adjust my choice accordingly. If the averages have been generally decreasing, I should lean towards lower numbers, and vice versa. Additionally, I should try to anticipate the behavior of other players, assuming they will also be strategic, and choose a number that could be close to the 2/3 average of a rational distribution of numbers between 0 and 100. This might involve selecting a number slightly below the calculated target, as other players might also aim for the target, causing the actual average to be slightly higher.\n\n```"

      "learnings": "Reflections:\n-The possible reason for failure in Round 1 is that my chosen number, 67.0, was significantly higher than the target number, 18.40. This indicates that I overestimated the average number that the players, including myself, would select. The discrepancy might stem from not considering the conservative nature of the game, where players might choose numbers closer to zero to minimize the risk of going over the target.\n\nNew High Level Plan:\nFor future rounds, I will adopt a more conservative strategy, aiming to choose numbers closer to zero while still considering the potential for other players to choose higher values. I will estimate a slightly higher average than Round 1, say around 30, and then select a number that is 2/3 of this estimated average to be closer to the actual target. This approach will balance the risk of choosing too high or too low, increasing the chances of being closer to the actual target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it seems that in both rounds, my chosen numbers were significantly different from the target number. In Round 1, I chose 67.0, which was much higher than the target of 18.40, and in Round 2, I chose 22.0, which was above the target of 13.20 but closer. The failure likely stems from overestimating the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I need to adopt a more conservative strategy. A high-level plan would be to initially choose numbers closer to 0, as players might be inclined to choose higher numbers thinking others will do the same, causing the average to be higher than expected. As the game progresses and more information about players' tendencies is available, I can adjust my strategy accordingly, aiming to stay within a smaller range around the predicted 2/3 of the average. This approach should increase the chances of selecting a number closer to the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that in the first two rounds, I chose numbers that were significantly higher than the target. In Round 1, I selected 67.0, which was far above the target of 18.40, and in Round 2, I chose 22.0, which was also higher than the target of 13.20. This suggests a tendency to overestimate the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan is to adopt a more conservative strategy and aim for a number slightly below the average. Since the target is 2/3 of the average, choosing a number slightly below the average will increase the chances of being closer to 2/3 of that average. Additionally, I should consider the distribution of numbers from previous rounds to better estimate where the average might fall. If players tend to choose higher numbers, I should adjust downward more aggressively, and vice versa.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that in the first two rounds, I chose numbers that were significantly higher than the target. In Round 1, I selected 67.0, which was far above the target of 18.40, and in Round 2, I chose 22.0, which was also higher than the target of 13.20. This suggests that I overestimated the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more conservative strategy and aim for numbers closer to the lower end of the range, considering that players might be inclined to choose smaller numbers to stay closer to the 2/3 average target. A high-level plan would be to initially select numbers around 10 or slightly below, as this could place me closer to the expected target. As the game progresses and I gather more information about the players' tendencies, I can adjust my strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that in the first round, I chose a number significantly higher than the target, and in the second round, I chose a number that was above the target but closer. However, in the following rounds, I won by selecting numbers that were either equal to or slightly above the target. The failure in the initial rounds seems to stem from overestimating the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan is to adopt a more conservative approach in my number selection. I should aim to choose numbers that are slightly below the midpoint of the 0 to 100 range, considering that players might tend to choose numbers around the middle. This strategy should place my selection closer to the potential average and, consequently, the target. Additionally, I should adjust my choice based on the trend of previous rounds, leaning towards the numbers that have been closer to the target in recent rounds.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that in the first two rounds, I chose numbers that were significantly higher than the target. In Round 1, I selected 67.0, which was far above the target of 18.40, and in Round 2, I chose 22.0, which was also higher than the target of 13.20. This suggests that I initially overestimated the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more conservative strategy and aim for numbers closer to the lower end of the range, considering that players might be inclined to choose smaller numbers to stay closer to the 2/3 target. A high-level plan would be to initially select numbers around 30-40, as this range seems to be closer to the calculated averages and targets observed in the early rounds. As the game progresses and more data is available, I can refine my strategy based on the evolving patterns of the average numbers chosen by all players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my initial strategy of choosing numbers close to the middle of the range (67.0 in Round 1 and 22.0 in Round 2) led to losses because the other players were selecting numbers closer to the target, resulting in a lower average. In the subsequent rounds, when I chose numbers closer to the calculated target, I won. However, in Round 7, my choice of 9.0 was still slightly above the target of 6.53, causing me to lose again.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy. I should consider the tendency of players to choose numbers below the average to get closer to the target, which is 2/3 of the average. My new plan is to estimate a lower bound for the average based on the assumption that other players will also be strategic. By selecting a number slightly above this estimated lower bound, I aim to be closer to the target while accounting for potential underestimations by other players. This approach should increase my chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my initial strategy of choosing numbers around the middle range (67.0, 22.0) was too high compared to the averages, causing me to lose in the early rounds. In the following rounds, I adjusted my strategy to select numbers closer to or equal to the target, which led to wins in Rounds 3-6. However, in Rounds 7 and 8, my choices were still slightly above the target, resulting in losses.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the trend of decreasing average numbers chosen by players. I should aim to select numbers slightly below the calculated target, considering that other players might also be adjusting their choices towards the lower end to approach the target. This new plan involves more anticipation of the collective behavior and adjusting my choice accordingly.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my initial strategy of choosing numbers around the middle range (67.0, 22.0) was too high compared to the actual averages, leading to losses in the first two rounds. In the following rounds, I adjusted my choices to be closer to the averages, which resulted in wins when my selections were near the target number. However, in Round 7, I slightly underestimated the target, and in Round 8, I overestimated it, both resulting in losses.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the trend of decreasing average numbers chosen by players. I should aim to select numbers that are slightly below the average, considering that players might also be adjusting downwards. This way, I can better approximate the 2/3 target, especially since the target is a fraction of the average, which would likely be lower as players learn from previous rounds. Additionally, I should account for the potential clustering of numbers around the target, and try to choose a number slightly below it to have a better chance of being the closest.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my initial strategy of choosing numbers close to the middle of the range (67.0 in Round 1 and 22.0 in Round 2) led to significant deviations from the target number. In subsequent rounds, I adjusted my choices to be closer to the target, which resulted in wins when my chosen number was near the winning number. However, in Rounds 7 and 8, I slightly overestimated the target, choosing 9.0 and 8.0 respectively, while the winning numbers were 8.0 and 6.0.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the trend of the average numbers chosen by players. I should aim to select a number that is slightly below the calculated target, considering that other players might also be adjusting their choices towards the target. This approach should increase the chances of being closer to the actual winning number. Additionally, I should be more cautious when the target is near the lower end of the range, as small deviations can lead to larger differences from the winning number.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice of numbers has been inconsistent with the target number. In rounds where I won, my chosen number was either the target number itself or very close to it. However, in the rounds I lost, I either overestimated or underestimated the target, which is 2/3 of the average. A possible reason for failure is not accurately predicting the average number chosen by all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. I should consider that other players might also be using a strategy to choose numbers around the 2/3 target. A high-level plan would be to choose numbers slightly below the expected 2/3 of the average, anticipating that the average might be pulled up by other players' strategic choices. This way, even if the average is higher than anticipated, my number would still be closer to the target. Additionally, I should monitor the trend of the average chosen numbers over previous rounds to adjust my strategy accordingly.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my initial strategy of choosing numbers around the middle range (67.0 in Round 1 and 22.0 in Round 2) led to losses, as the actual averages were much lower. In subsequent rounds, I adjusted my choices to be closer to the target, which resulted in more wins. However, there were instances (Round 7 and 8) where I slightly overestimated the target, choosing 9.0 and 8.0, respectively, when the winning numbers were 8.0 and 6.0.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the decreasing trend in average numbers chosen by players. I should aim to select numbers closer to the lower end of the range, around 2/3 of the current average, and be more precise in estimating the target. This can be achieved by considering the tendency for players to choose lower numbers over time, as seen in the game log, and adjusting my choice accordingly. Additionally, I should be more cautious when the target is near a whole number, as players might cluster around that number, leading to a slightly lower actual target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my initial strategy of choosing numbers close to the middle of the range (67.0 in Round 1 and 22.0 in Round 2) led to losses because the actual averages were much lower. As the game progressed, I adapted and started choosing numbers closer to the target, which resulted in more wins. However, there were instances (like Round 7 and 8) where I slightly overestimated the target, leading to losses.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should develop a more data-driven approach. I should consider the trend of decreasing average numbers chosen by players and try to predict this trend for the next round. Additionally, I should account for the fact that players might also be adjusting their choices, potentially clustering around the target. A new high-level plan would be to calculate a moving average of the previous few rounds' averages, then aim for a number slightly below that average to anticipate other players' potential convergence on the target. This strategy should improve my chances of being closer to the 2/3 target of the actual average.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my initial strategy of choosing numbers around the middle of the range (67.0 in Round 1, 22.0 in Round 2, and 9.0 in Round 7) led to losses, as I was not accurately predicting the average chosen by other players. In contrast, when I chose numbers closer to the target or the lower end of the range (12.0, 11.0, 10.0, 8.0, 5.0, 3.0, 2.67, and 2.0), I won more rounds. This suggests that a more successful strategy would be to lean towards selecting numbers that are slightly below the expected average, considering that 2/3 of the average tends to be a lower value.\n\nNew High Level Plan:\nTo improve my performance, I will adopt a strategy of estimating a slightly lower-than-average number, taking into account the tendency of other players to choose numbers around the middle of the range. I will also consider the historical data, which shows a decreasing trend in the average chosen number, and adjust my choice accordingly. If the average continues to decrease, I might choose even lower numbers, but always keeping in mind the target number and the potential range of other players' selections.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice of numbers has been inconsistent with the target. In some rounds, I chose numbers that were too high, while in others, I was too low. This inconsistency could be due to not accurately predicting the average number chosen by all players. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach, such as trying to predict the average by considering the range of numbers players are likely to select. A high level plan would be to choose a number around the median of the possible range (50) when the average is unknown, and adjust based on the observed averages from previous rounds. This should help me stay closer to the target, which is 2/3 of the average. Additionally, I should consider the tendency of other players to adjust their choices based on previous rounds, and factor that into my decision-making.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my initial strategy of choosing numbers around the middle range (67.0, 22.0, 9.0, 8.0) was not effective, as the target number tends to be lower due to the 2/3 multiplier. In rounds where I won, I chose numbers closer to the target, often selecting the winning number itself (12.0, 11.0, 10.0, 8.0, 5.0, 3.0, 2.67, 2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 3.0). The failure in rounds 7, 8, 10, and 15 can be attributed to underestimating the target or not adjusting for the decreasing averages.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy: start by choosing numbers closer to the lower end of the range (around 10-20), and as the game progresses and averages decrease, adjust my choice to be closer to 2/3 of the current average. This approach should increase the likelihood of selecting a number closer to the target. Additionally, I should pay attention to the tendency of other players to choose lower numbers, which could drive the average down further.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice of numbers has been inconsistent with the target number. In some rounds, I chose numbers that were too high, while in others, I was too low. This inconsistency can be attributed to not accurately predicting the average number chosen by all players. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach by considering the trend of the average numbers chosen and adjusting my selection accordingly. A potential plan is to choose a number slightly below the arithmetic mean of the previous winning numbers, as this might help me stay closer to the target number which is 2/3 of the average. Additionally, I should account for the possibility of other players using similar strategies and adjust my choice accordingly to anticipate a shift in the average.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice of numbers has been inconsistent, often being too high when the average is higher and too low when the average is lower. This suggests a lack of a systematic strategy in predicting the target number. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more data-driven approach. A new plan could be to calculate the moving average of the target numbers over the last few rounds and choose a number slightly below this moving average, anticipating that players might slightly overestimate the average. This strategy accounts for the tendency of players to cluster their choices around certain numbers, which affects the actual average and, consequently, the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice of numbers has been inconsistent, often selecting numbers that are either too high or too low compared to the target. In some rounds, I accurately predicted the target, while in others, I overestimated or underestimated it. A possible reason for failure is not adequately accounting for the potential range of numbers other players might choose and how that would affect the average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. I should consider the trend of the average chosen numbers and target numbers over the previous rounds and adjust my choice accordingly. If the averages have been generally decreasing, I should lean towards lower numbers, and vice versa. Additionally, I should try to anticipate the behavior of other players, assuming they will also be strategic, and choose a number that could be close to the 2/3 average of a rational distribution of numbers between 0 and 100. This might involve selecting a number slightly below the calculated target, as other players might also aim for the target, causing the actual average to be slightly higher.\n",

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure in Round 1 is that my chosen number, 1.0, was significantly lower than the target number, 18.40. This suggests that I underestimated the average number that the players, including myself, would select. The discrepancy might have arisen from not considering the full range of numbers (0 to 100) and the tendency for players to choose numbers closer to the middle of the range.\n\nTo mitigate this failure in future rounds, I will adopt a more strategic approach. My new high-level plan is to initially estimate a conservative average around the middle of the range, such as 50, and then calculate 2/3 of that value as a starting point. I will also consider the distribution of numbers within the range, accounting for potential clustering around certain values. As the game progresses and I gather more data on the average numbers chosen, I can adjust my strategy accordingly to better predict the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it seems that in both rounds, my chosen numbers were significantly lower than the target numbers. In Round 1, I chose 1.0 while the target was 18.40, and in Round 2, I chose 5.0 with a target of 13.20. This suggests that my strategy of selecting low numbers is not effective, as I'm underestimating the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more balanced approach that takes into account the possibility of other players also choosing lower numbers. A new high-level plan would be to calculate the median of the possible numbers (between 0 and 100) and then select a number that is 2/3 of that median. This should provide a better estimate of the target, considering that the average is being pulled down by my own low selections. Additionally, I should also consider the possibility of other players using similar strategies and adjust accordingly.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my chosen numbers have been consistently far from the target. In Round 1, I chose 1.0, which was much lower than the target of 18.40. In Round 2, I chose 5.0, which was again below the target of 13.20, and in Round 3, I chose 23.0, significantly above the target of 12.40. The failure seems to stem from underestimating the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I need to adjust my strategy and consider a more central tendency for my selections. A high-level plan would be to choose numbers closer to the middle of the range, around 50, as this should be more representative of the average chosen by the players. Additionally, I should consider the trend in the averages from previous rounds and adjust slightly towards the target number calculated from those averages. This adaptive approach should help me get closer to the 2/3 of the average target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my chosen numbers have consistently been farther away from the target number, which is 2/3 of the average of all selections. In Round 1, I chose 1.0, Round 2, 5.0, Round 3, 23.0, and Round 4, 12.0. The common issue here seems to be an underestimation of the average number chosen by the players, as my selections have either been too low or too high compared to the target.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan is to adopt a more strategic approach in estimating the average. I will consider the tendency of players to choose numbers around the middle, such as 50, since it's a natural inclination. I will also factor in the results from previous rounds to adjust my choice accordingly. For instance, if the average has been decreasing, I might lean towards a lower number, and if it's increasing, I might choose a higher number. This adaptive strategy should help me better approximate the target number.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my chosen numbers have consistently been far from the target number. In Round 1, I chose 1.0, which was too low, and in subsequent rounds, my selections were either too high (23.0 and 40.0) or slightly above the target (5.0 and 12.0). The failure seems to stem from an inaccurate estimation of the average number chosen by all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I need to adopt a more strategic approach. A possible high-level plan is to adopt a regression-based strategy, where I start by selecting the average of the target numbers from the previous rounds. This will help me converge towards the optimal range. Additionally, I should consider the distribution of numbers chosen by other players, tending towards the middle ground to account for the 2/3 average rule. If the average chosen number appears to be consistently decreasing or increasing, I should adjust my choice accordingly to better predict the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my chosen numbers have consistently been far from the target number. In Round 1, I chose 1.0, which was too low, and in subsequent rounds, my selections were either too high (e.g., 23.0 in Round 3 and 40.0 in Round 5) or just slightly off the mark (e.g., 5.0 in Round 2 and 12.0 in Round 4). The failure seems to stem from an inaccurate estimation of the average number chosen by all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I need to adopt a more strategic approach. A possible high-level plan is to adopt a regression-to-the-middle strategy, where I anticipate that players will eventually gravitate towards the middle values (around 50) as the game progresses. In the early rounds, when numbers are likely scattered, I should choose numbers closer to the lower end of the range, and as the game continues, I should gradually increase my selection towards the expected average. Additionally, I should consider the deviation of the numbers chosen in previous rounds to adjust my selection accordingly, ensuring it stays close to 2/3 of the calculated average.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my chosen numbers have consistently been far from the target number. In Round 1, I chose 1.0, which is significantly lower than the target of 18.40. In Round 3, I chose 23.0 when the target was 12.40, and in Round 5, I selected 40.0 with a target of 10.13. These choices indicate a pattern of underestimating the average and the target number.\n\nTo improve, I need to adopt a more strategic approach. A high-level plan would be to initially estimate a conservative average around the middle of the range (50) and adjust this estimate based on the previous round's average. If the previous average is consistently below 50, I should lean towards choosing numbers closer to the lower end of the range, and vice versa. Additionally, I should consider the clustering of numbers around the target in previous rounds to anticipate where other players might land their choices. This way, I can better position my number to be closer to the 2/3 average target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my chosen numbers have consistently been far from the target number. The primary reason for this failure seems to be an underestimation of the average number chosen by the players and an inadequate adjustment to the target number. To mitigate this, I need to adopt a more strategic approach in estimating the average. A high-level plan would be to start by selecting numbers closer to the middle range, around 50, and then adjust based on the average chosen by other players. As the game progresses, I can refine my strategy by observing if players tend to choose higher or lower numbers and adjust accordingly to better predict the target. Additionally, I should consider the potential impact of my own choice on the average and try to anticipate how other players might also reason about the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my chosen numbers have consistently been far from the target number. The primary reason for this failure seems to be an underestimation of the average number chosen by the players and an inadequate adjustment to the target number. To mitigate this, I need to adopt a more strategic approach in estimating the average. A high-level plan would be to start by selecting numbers closer to the middle range, around 50, and then adjust based on the average chosen by other players in the previous rounds. This should help me get closer to the target number, which is 2/3 of the average. Additionally, I should consider the trend of other players' numbers and adjust my choice accordingly, expecting some level of strategic thinking from them as well.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my chosen numbers have consistently been farther from the target number, which is 2/3 of the average.

In several rounds, I've chosen numbers significantly higher or lower than the actual target. \n\nTo mitigate this failure, I need to adopt a more strategic approach. A promising strategy would be to initially lean towards selecting numbers closer to the middle of the allowed range (around 50) since players often tend to choose numbers around the average. As the game progresses and I gather more information about the tendencies of other players, I can adjust my choices accordingly, either by moving closer to or farther from the average, depending on whether the average is trending up or down. This adaptive strategy should increase the chances of selecting a number closer to the target.\nReflections:\n-Upon reviewing the historical data, a consistent pattern in my choices can be observed. I have often chosen numbers that are either too high or too close to the target, which has led to losses. In several rounds, I chose numbers around 5 or 7, which were consistently below the target. This suggests a possible underestimation of the average number chosen by the other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan is to adopt a more adaptive strategy. I will start by estimating a higher average, around 50, for the first few rounds, and then adjust my choice based on the actual average after each round. If the actual average is consistently lower, I will gradually decrease my chosen number towards the target. This approach should help me better approximate the target number and increase my chances of winning. Additionally, I will avoid repeating the same number in consecutive rounds, as it may not reflect the changing dynamics of the game.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my chosen numbers have consistently been farther from the target number, which is 2/3 of the average.

A high-level plan would be to initially choose numbers closer to zero, assuming that other players might also be cautious. As the game progresses and I gather more information about the average chosen by other players, I can adjust my strategy accordingly, aiming to stay slightly below the calculated average to account for the 2/3 target.

      "learnings": "Reflections:\n-The possible reason for failure in Round 1 is that my chosen number, 1.0, was significantly lower than the target number, 18.40. This suggests that I underestimated the average number that the players, including myself, would select. The discrepancy might have arisen from not considering the full range of numbers (0 to 100) and the tendency for players to choose numbers closer to the middle of the range.\n\nTo mitigate this failure in future rounds, I will adopt a more strategic approach. My new high-level plan is to initially estimate a conservative average around the middle of the range, such as 50, and then calculate 2/3 of that value as a starting point. I will also consider the distribution of numbers within the range, accounting for potential clustering around certain values. As the game progresses and I gather more data on the average numbers chosen, I can adjust my strategy accordingly to better predict the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it seems that in both rounds, my chosen numbers were significantly lower than the target numbers. In Round 1, I chose 1.0 while the target was 18.40, and in Round 2, I chose 5.0 with a target of 13.20. This suggests that my strategy of selecting low numbers is not effective, as I'm underestimating the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more balanced approach that takes into account the possibility of other players also choosing lower numbers. A new high-level plan would be to calculate the median of the possible numbers (between 0 and 100) and then select a number that is 2/3 of that median. This should provide a better estimate of the target, considering that the average is being pulled down by my own low selections. Additionally, I should also consider the possibility of other players using similar strategies and adjust accordingly.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my chosen numbers have been consistently far from the target. In Round 1, I chose 1.0, which was much lower than the target of 18.40. In Round 2, I chose 5.0, which was again below the target of 13.20, and in Round 3, I chose 23.0, significantly above the target of 12.40. The failure seems to stem from underestimating the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I need to adjust my strategy and consider a more central tendency for my selections. A high-level plan would be to choose numbers closer to the middle of the range, around 50, as this should be more representative of the average chosen by the players. Additionally, I should consider the trend in the averages from previous rounds and adjust slightly towards the target number calculated from those averages. This adaptive approach should help me get closer to the 2/3 of the average target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my chosen numbers have consistently been farther away from the target number, which is 2/3 of the average of all selections. In Round 1, I chose 1.0, Round 2, 5.0, Round 3, 23.0, and Round 4, 12.0. The common issue here seems to be an underestimation of the average number chosen by the players, as my selections have either been too low or too high compared to the target.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan is to adopt a more strategic approach in estimating the average. I will consider the tendency of players to choose numbers around the middle, such as 50, since it's a natural inclination. I will also factor in the results from previous rounds to adjust my choice accordingly. For instance, if the average has been decreasing, I might lean towards a lower number, and if it's increasing, I might choose a higher number. This adaptive strategy should help me better approximate the target number.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my chosen numbers have consistently been far from the target number. In Round 1, I chose 1.0, which was too low, and in subsequent rounds, my selections were either too high (23.0 and 40.0) or slightly above the target (5.0 and 12.0). The failure seems to stem from an inaccurate estimation of the average number chosen by all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I need to adopt a more strategic approach. A possible high-level plan is to adopt a regression-based strategy, where I start by selecting the average of the target numbers from the previous rounds. This will help me converge towards the optimal range. Additionally, I should consider the distribution of numbers chosen by other players, tending towards the middle ground to account for the 2/3 average rule. If the average chosen number appears to be consistently decreasing or increasing, I should adjust my choice accordingly to better predict the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my chosen numbers have consistently been far from the target number. In Round 1, I chose 1.0, which was too low, and in subsequent rounds, my selections were either too high (e.g., 23.0 in Round 3 and 40.0 in Round 5) or just slightly off the mark (e.g., 5.0 in Round 2 and 12.0 in Round 4). The failure seems to stem from an inaccurate estimation of the average number chosen by all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I need to adopt a more strategic approach. A possible high-level plan is to adopt a regression-to-the-middle strategy, where I anticipate that players will eventually gravitate towards the middle values (around 50) as the game progresses. In the early rounds, when numbers are likely scattered, I should choose numbers closer to the lower end of the range, and as the game continues, I should gradually increase my selection towards the expected average. Additionally, I should consider the deviation of the numbers chosen in previous rounds to adjust my selection accordingly, ensuring it stays close to 2/3 of the calculated average.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my chosen numbers have consistently been far from the target number. In Round 1, I chose 1.0, which is significantly lower than the target of 18.40. In Round 3, I chose 23.0 when the target was 12.40, and in Round 5, I selected 40.0 with a target of 10.13. These choices indicate a pattern of underestimating the average and the target number.\n\nTo improve, I need to adopt a more strategic approach. A high-level plan would be to initially estimate a conservative average around the middle of the range (50) and adjust this estimate based on the previous round's average. If the previous average is consistently below 50, I should lean towards choosing numbers closer to the lower end of the range, and vice versa. Additionally, I should consider the clustering of numbers around the target in previous rounds to anticipate where other players might land their choices. This way, I can better position my number to be closer to the 2/3 average target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my chosen numbers have consistently been far from the target number. The primary reason for this failure seems to be an underestimation of the average number chosen by the players and an inadequate adjustment to the target number. To mitigate this, I need to adopt a more strategic approach in estimating the average. A high-level plan would be to start by selecting numbers closer to the middle range, around 50, and then adjust based on the average chosen by other players. As the game progresses, I can refine my strategy by observing if players tend to choose higher or lower numbers and adjust accordingly to better predict the target. Additionally, I should consider the potential impact of my own choice on the average and try to anticipate how other players might also reason about the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my chosen numbers have consistently been far from the target number.

The primary reason for this failure seems to be an underestimation of the average number chosen by the players. In several rounds, I've chosen numbers significantly higher or lower than the actual target. \n\nTo mitigate this failure, I need to adopt a more strategic approach. A promising strategy would be to initially lean towards selecting numbers closer to the middle of the allowed range (around 50) since players often tend to choose numbers around the average. As the game progresses and I gather more information about the tendencies of other players, I can adjust my choices accordingly, either by moving closer to or farther from the average, depending on whether the average is trending up or down. This adaptive strategy should increase the chances of selecting a number closer to the target.\nReflections:\n-Upon reviewing the historical data, a consistent pattern in my choices can be observed. I have often chosen numbers that are either too high or too close to the target, which has led to losses. In several rounds, I chose numbers around 5 or 7, which were consistently below the target. This suggests a possible underestimation of the average number chosen by the other players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan is to adopt a more adaptive strategy. I will start by estimating a higher average, around 50, for the first few rounds, and then adjust my choice based on the actual average after each round. If the actual average is consistently lower, I will gradually decrease my chosen number towards the target. This approach should help me better approximate the target number and increase my chances of winning. Additionally, I will avoid repeating the same number in consecutive rounds, as it may not reflect the changing dynamics of the game.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my chosen numbers have consistently been farther from the target number, which is 2/3 of the average.

A high-level plan would be to initially choose numbers closer to zero, assuming that other players might also be cautious. As the game progresses and I gather more information about the average chosen by other players, I can adjust my strategy accordingly, aiming to stay slightly below the calculated average to account for the 2/3 target.

A new high-level plan would be to calculate the target number and then select a number that is slightly lower, say 85% of the target, to account for the potential underestimation by other players. This should increase the chances of being closer to the actual winning number.\n",

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure in Round 1 is that I chose a number significantly lower than the target number. The target was 18.40, which is closer to the middle of the 0 to 100 range, while I selected 1.0. This indicates a misunderstanding or underestimation of the average number that players might choose.\n\nNew High Level Plan:\nTo improve my strategy, I should consider that players are likely to choose numbers around the middle of the range, given the game's incentives to be close to the target. In future rounds, I will aim to select a number around 60, which is closer to 2/3 of the expected average when all players choose randomly from 0 to 100. This will adjust my approach to better align with the expected behavior of other players. However, I will also adapt my choice based on the evolving patterns of the game, such as if players tend to choose higher or lower numbers in consecutive rounds.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it seems that in Round 1, I chose a number significantly lower than the target, and in Round 2, I chose a number much higher than the target. The failure likely stems from not accurately estimating the average number that other players would choose. My new high-level plan should involve adopting a more strategic approach to predicting the average. I will consider the following:\n\n1. Observe the range of numbers chosen in previous rounds to identify any patterns or tendencies among players.\n2. Assume that players might employ a similar strategy, such as choosing numbers around the middle (e.g., 50) or numbers that are closer to 2/3 of the average from previous rounds.\n3. Calculate a predicted average based on these assumptions and then select a number close to 2/3 of that predicted average.\n4. If no clear pattern emerges, choose a number slightly below the middle to account for the potential overestimation by other players, as people tend to choose higher numbers.\n\nBy implementing this plan, I aim to better align my choices with the target number and increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it seems that my choices have consistently been far from the target number. In Round 1, I chose 1.0, which was much lower than the target of 18.40. In Round 2, I selected 37.0, which was higher than the target of 13.20, and in Round 3, I chose 22.0, which was also higher than the target of 12.40. The failure here lies in the lack of accurate estimation of the average number chosen by all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I need to adopt a more strategic approach. A possible high-level plan is to consider the range of numbers within which the target typically falls. Since the target is 2/3 of the average and the average is between 0 and 100, the target usually lies between 0 and 66.67. I should also take into account the other players' behavior, assuming they might be using similar reasoning. A more conservative strategy could be to choose a number slightly below the middle of this range, say around 33, to account for the possibility of higher average selections. Additionally, I should adjust my choice based on the trends from previous rounds, if any, to better predict where the average might land.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that in the first three rounds, I chose numbers that were significantly different from the target number. In Round 1, I chose 1.0, which was too low, and in Rounds 2 and 3, I selected 37.0 and 22.0, respectively, both being much higher than the targets. The wins and losses suggest that I was not accurately estimating the average number chosen by all players.\n\nTo improve my strategy, I should adopt a more adaptive approach. I will start by considering a conservative estimate for the average, such as the middle value (50), and adjust based on the previous round's results. If the average is consistently above or below 50, I will lean towards that direction. Additionally, I should aim to stay within a closer range to the previous target, as it indicates a pattern in the collective choices of all players. This way, I can increase my chances of being closer to the 2/3 target of the average.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that I have been consistently choosing numbers that are either too low or too high compared to the target number. In Round 1, I chose 1.0, which was significantly below the target of 18.40. In Round 2, I selected 37.0, which was far above the target of 13.20. Round 3 saw a choice of 22.0, again higher than the target of 12.40. Although I won in Round 4 by choosing 11.0, which was close to the target of 8.13, I lost in Round 5 by selecting 9.0, which was slightly below the target of 10.13.\n\nThe failure seems to stem from an inaccurate estimation of the average number chosen by all players, leading to selections that are not close to 2/3 of the average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan is to adopt a more strategic approach. I will start by considering the range of numbers (0-100) and the fact that players are likely to choose numbers around the middle, given the target is 2/3 of the average. I will aim to choose a number that is slightly below the expected average, as this should be closer to 2/3 of the actual average when all selections are made. Additionally, I will adjust my choice based on the trend of previous rounds, taking into account if players are consistently choosing higher or lower numbers. This adaptive strategy should improve my chances of selecting a number closer to the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my selections have consistently been farther from the target number compared to the winning numbers. In Round 1, I chose 1.0, which was too low, and in Rounds 2, 3, and 6, I chose numbers significantly higher than the target. In Rounds 4 and 5, while I was closer to the target, I still didn't win as I chose numbers slightly below it. The key issue seems to be an inaccurate estimation of the average number chosen by all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I need to adopt a more strategic approach. A possible high-level plan is to adopt a probabilistic strategy, where I estimate the average based on the assumption that other players will choose numbers uniformly across the range. I should consider the tendency of players to cluster around the middle, i.e., around 50, and adjust my choice accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of this estimated average. Additionally, I should dynamically adapt my strategy as the game progresses, taking into account the numbers chosen in previous rounds to refine my estimate of the average.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my selections have consistently been farther from the target number, often tending towards higher values. In Round 4, I won by choosing 11.0, which was close to the target of 8.13, but in other rounds, my choices were either too low (Round 1: 1.0) or too high (Rounds 2, 3, 6, 7: 37.0, 22.0, 16.0, 11.0) compared to the target. The key to success seems to be selecting a number that is close to 2/3 of the expected average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. I need to anticipate the average number chosen by all players, considering that they are also trying to get close to 2/3 of the average. A reasonable assumption might be that players will choose numbers around the middle, say around 50. Therefore, I should initially aim for a number around 33 (2/3 of 50) and adjust based on the observed tendencies of other players over the course of the game. If players tend to choose lower numbers, I should adjust my choice upwards, and vice versa. This adaptive strategy should improve my chances of selecting a number closer to the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my choices have often been far from the target number, which is 2/3 of the average. In the early rounds, I chose numbers that were either too low (Round 1) or too high (Round 2, 3, 5, 6, 7), while in Round 4 and 8, I won by choosing numbers closer to the target. The key to success seems to be selecting a number that is close to but slightly below the expected average, considering that the target is 2/3 of the average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan is to estimate the average number chosen by players based on the historical data and then select a number slightly below that estimate, accounting for the 2/3 ratio. As the game progresses and more data becomes available, I can refine my estimate and adjust my choice accordingly. This strategy aims to keep my selections closer to the target number, increasing the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my selections have often been far from the target number, which is 2/3 of the average chosen number. In the early rounds, I chose numbers that were either too low (Round 1) or too high (Round 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9), while in the winning rounds (Round 4, 8), my choices were closer to the target. The main issue seems to be an inaccurate estimation of the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I need to develop a more strategic approach to predicting the average. A high-level plan would be to adopt a more centered and adaptive strategy. In the beginning, I could start by choosing numbers around the middle, such as 50, to gauge the general tendency of the other players. As the game progresses and I have more data on the average chosen numbers, I can adjust my selections accordingly, aiming to stay closer to 2/3 of the calculated average. This approach should increase the likelihood of selecting a number closer to the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been either too low or too high compared to the target number. In the early rounds, I chose numbers that were significantly below the target, while in later rounds, I tended to choose numbers above the target. This inconsistency suggests a lack of a clear strategy in estimating the average number chosen by all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more systematic approach. A potential strategy is to start by estimating the average number based on the information from previous rounds. If the average has been consistently below 20, I should lean towards choosing a number slightly above the target to account for potential increases in others' selections. If the average is above 20, I should choose slightly below the target. As the game progresses and more data is available, I can refine my estimate by calculating the average of the averages and using that to predict the target more accurately. This adaptive strategy should improve my chances of selecting a number closer to the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been either too high or too low compared to the target number. In the early rounds, I chose numbers that were significantly different from the averages, leading to losses. In later rounds, when I adjusted towards lower numbers, I still didn't accurately predict the target, which was typically closer to the lower end of the range. To improve, I should adopt a more strategic approach that takes into account the tendency for players to choose numbers around the middle, given the game's incentives. A high-level plan would be to initially lean towards lower numbers, around 10-20, and adjust my choice based on the average chosen number, aiming to stay within a 5-10 point range of the target. This strategy should increase the chances of selecting a number closer to the 2/3 average.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been far from the target number, which is 2/3 of the average. In the early rounds, I chose numbers that were either too low (e.g., 1.0, 37.0) or too high (e.g., 22.0) compared to the eventual averages. In later rounds, I seemed to have overcorrected, selecting numbers that were closer but still not precise enough (e.g., 9.0, 11.0). The primary reason for failure seems to be a lack of accurate prediction of the average number chosen by all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I need to develop a more strategic approach to estimating the average. A high-level plan would be to adopt a more centered and adaptive strategy. I should consider choosing numbers around the mid-point (50) initially, as it's a balanced choice. As the game progresses and I observe the tendencies of other players (e.g., if they tend to choose higher or lower numbers), I can adjust my choice accordingly to stay closer to the target. Additionally, I should account for the potential impact of my own choice on the average and try to predict how others might react to my previous selections. This way, I can more effectively predict the target and increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my selections have often been too high compared to the target number. In the early rounds, I chose numbers far above the target, and even when I adjusted downwards, I still tended to overshoot. The key to winning seems to be selecting numbers closer to or slightly below the calculated target, considering that my choice also contributes to the average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more conservative strategy. I will start by estimating a lower bound for the average based on the assumption that other players might also choose low numbers. Then, I'll calculate 2/3 of this estimated lower bound as my target. Finally, I'll select a number slightly below this target to account for the potential increase in the average due to my own choice. This approach should increase the chances of selecting a number closer to the actual target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my strategy has been inconsistent and often too far from the target number. In the early rounds, I chose numbers that were either too low or too high, not accurately predicting the average chosen by other players. In later rounds, I seemed to be underestimating the average, often selecting numbers closer to the lower end of the range.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive approach. I should consider the trend of the averages and the target numbers from previous rounds and adjust my choice accordingly. If the averages have been generally decreasing, it might indicate that players are selecting lower numbers, and I should lean towards the higher end of the range. Conversely, if averages are increasing, I should choose a bit higher. Additionally, I should aim to stay closer to the middle of the range to have a better chance of being closer to 2/3 of the average, unless there's a clear pattern suggesting otherwise.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my strategy has been inconsistent and often too far from the target number. In the early rounds, I chose numbers that were either too low or too high, and as the game progressed, I didn't adapt well to the decreasing average chosen by other players. This led to losses when the target number was closer to zero.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic and adaptive approach. I should start by estimating the average number chosen by players based on the previous rounds, considering that players might be selecting numbers close to the target in later rounds. Then, I should calculate 2/3 of this estimated average and aim for a number slightly below it, accounting for the possibility that other players might also be using a similar strategy. This should increase the chances of being closer to the actual target number. Additionally, I should be more cautious when the average is low, as small deviations can lead to larger differences from the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my selections have often been far from the target number. In the early rounds, I chose numbers that were either too low or too high, not accurately predicting the average chosen by other players. In later rounds, I seemed to have overcorrected, tending to choose numbers closer to the extremes rather than the anticipated average. To improve, I need to develop a more accurate prediction strategy for the average number chosen by all players.\n\nNew High Level Plan:\n1. Observe the trend in average numbers chosen by players over the previous rounds.\n2. Consider a clustering of numbers around a central tendency (mean or median) for each round.\n3. Make a selection that is slightly below 2/3 of the predicted average, accounting for the potential for other players to also aim close to the target.\n4. Adjust the selection based on the variability of the previous rounds' choices; if numbers have been more scattered, choose a number with wider margins from the target.\n5. Continuously update the strategy based on the outcomes of each round to refine the prediction model.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that my strategy has been inconsistent and often too far from the target number. In several rounds, I chose numbers that were either too high or too low, not accurately predicting the average chosen by other players. To improve, I should adopt a more adaptive approach, considering the trend of previous rounds' averages and adjusting my choice accordingly. A potential plan is to calculate a moving average of the last few rounds and select a number slightly below it to account for the 2/3 factor. This should increase the likelihood of being closer to the target number. Additionally, I should avoid extremes (numbers close to 0 or 100) as they are less likely to result in a win.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my chosen numbers have often been far from the target number, which is 2/3 of the average. In several instances, I've chosen numbers on the extremes, such as 1.0, 37.0, 16.0, and 25.0, which have led to losses. The primary reason for failure seems to be an inability to accurately predict the average number chosen by all players and then selecting a number close to 2/3 of that average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I need to adopt a more strategic approach. A high-level plan would be to adopt a conservative strategy, tending towards lower numbers, since players might subconsciously choose higher numbers, leading to a higher average. I should also consider the distribution of numbers chosen in previous rounds to estimate the average. If the average has been consistently decreasing, I should choose even lower numbers. Moreover, I should aim to stay within a range around 2/3 of the average from previous rounds, adjusting slightly based on the trend of the averages. This way, I can better position my choice to be closer to the target number.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that my strategy has been inconsistent and often too far from the target number. In the early rounds, I chose numbers that were either too low or too high, and as the game progressed, I didn't adapt well to the decreasing average chosen by other players. This led to repeated losses, especially when other players were clustering around the target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive approach. I should start by estimating the average number chosen by players based on the current round and the trend from previous rounds. Then, I should aim to select a number that is slightly below the calculated average to account for the 2/3 factor in the target number. This way, I can better align my choices with the target. Additionally, as the game progresses and numbers trend downward, I should adjust my selections to follow this trend while maintaining a buffer for the target calculation. This new strategy should increase my chances of selecting a number closer to the target.\n\n```"

      "learnings": "Reflections:\n-The possible reason for failure in Round 1 is that I chose a number significantly lower than the target number. The target was 18.40, which is closer to the middle of the 0 to 100 range, while I selected 1.0. This indicates a misunderstanding or underestimation of the average number that players might choose.\n\nNew High Level Plan:\nTo improve my strategy, I should consider that players are likely to choose numbers around the middle of the range, given the game's incentives to be close to the target. In future rounds, I will aim to select a number around 60, which is closer to 2/3 of the expected average when all players choose randomly from 0 to 100. This will adjust my approach to better align with the expected behavior of other players. However, I will also adapt my choice based on the evolving patterns of the game, such as if players tend to choose higher or lower numbers in consecutive rounds.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it seems that in Round 1, I chose a number significantly lower than the target, and in Round 2, I chose a number much higher than the target. The failure likely stems from not accurately estimating the average number that other players would choose. My new high-level plan should involve adopting a more strategic approach to predicting the average. I will consider the following:\n\n1. Observe the range of numbers chosen in previous rounds to identify any patterns or tendencies among players.\n2. Assume that players might employ a similar strategy, such as choosing numbers around the middle (e.g., 50) or numbers that are closer to 2/3 of the average from previous rounds.\n3. Calculate a predicted average based on these assumptions and then select a number close to 2/3 of that predicted average.\n4. If no clear pattern emerges, choose a number slightly below the middle to account for the potential overestimation by other players, as people tend to choose higher numbers.\n\nBy implementing this plan, I aim to better align my choices with the target number and increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it seems that my choices have consistently been far from the target number. In Round 1, I chose 1.0, which was much lower than the target of 18.40. In Round 2, I selected 37.0, which was higher than the target of 13.20, and in Round 3, I chose 22.0, which was also higher than the target of 12.40. The failure here lies in the lack of accurate estimation of the average number chosen by all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I need to adopt a more strategic approach. A possible high-level plan is to consider the range of numbers within which the target typically falls. Since the target is 2/3 of the average and the average is between 0 and 100, the target usually lies between 0 and 66.67. I should also take into account the other players' behavior, assuming they might be using similar reasoning. A more conservative strategy could be to choose a number slightly below the middle of this range, say around 33, to account for the possibility of higher average selections. Additionally, I should adjust my choice based on the trends from previous rounds, if any, to better predict where the average might land.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that in the first three rounds, I chose numbers that were significantly different from the target number. In Round 1, I chose 1.0, which was too low, and in Rounds 2 and 3, I selected 37.0 and 22.0, respectively, both being much higher than the targets. The wins and losses suggest that I was not accurately estimating the average number chosen by all players.\n\nTo improve my strategy, I should adopt a more adaptive approach. I will start by considering a conservative estimate for the average, such as the middle value (50), and adjust based on the previous round's results. If the average is consistently above or below 50, I will lean towards that direction. Additionally, I should aim to stay within a closer range to the previous target, as it indicates a pattern in the collective choices of all players. This way, I can increase my chances of being closer to the 2/3 target of the average.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that I have been consistently choosing numbers that are either too low or too high compared to the target number. In Round 1, I chose 1.0, which was significantly below the target of 18.40. In Round 2, I selected 37.0, which was far above the target of 13.20. Round 3 saw a choice of 22.0, again higher than the target of 12.40. Although I won in Round 4 by choosing 11.0, which was close to the target of 8.13, I lost in Round 5 by selecting 9.0, which was slightly below the target of 10.13.\n\nThe failure seems to stem from an inaccurate estimation of the average number chosen by all players, leading to selections that are not close to 2/3 of the average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan is to adopt a more strategic approach. I will start by considering the range of numbers (0-100) and the fact that players are likely to choose numbers around the middle, given the target is 2/3 of the average. I will aim to choose a number that is slightly below the expected average, as this should be closer to 2/3 of the actual average when all selections are made. Additionally, I will adjust my choice based on the trend of previous rounds, taking into account if players are consistently choosing higher or lower numbers. This adaptive strategy should improve my chances of selecting a number closer to the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my selections have consistently been farther from the target number compared to the winning numbers. In Round 1, I chose 1.0, which was too low, and in Rounds 2, 3, and 6, I chose numbers significantly higher than the target. In Rounds 4 and 5, while I was closer to the target, I still didn't win as I chose numbers slightly below it. The key issue seems to be an inaccurate estimation of the average number chosen by all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I need to adopt a more strategic approach. A possible high-level plan is to adopt a probabilistic strategy, where I estimate the average based on the assumption that other players will choose numbers uniformly across the range. I should consider the tendency of players to cluster around the middle, i.e., around 50, and adjust my choice accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of this estimated average. Additionally, I should dynamically adapt my strategy as the game progresses, taking into account the numbers chosen in previous rounds to refine my estimate of the average.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my selections have consistently been farther from the target number, often tending towards higher values. In Round 4, I won by choosing 11.0, which was close to the target of 8.13, but in other rounds, my choices were either too low (Round 1: 1.0) or too high (Rounds 2, 3, 6, 7: 37.0, 22.0, 16.0, 11.0) compared to the target. The key to success seems to be selecting a number that is close to 2/3 of the expected average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach. I need to anticipate the average number chosen by all players, considering that they are also trying to get close to 2/3 of the average. A reasonable assumption might be that players will choose numbers around the middle, say around 50. Therefore, I should initially aim for a number around 33 (2/3 of 50) and adjust based on the observed tendencies of other players over the course of the game. If players tend to choose lower numbers, I should adjust my choice upwards, and vice versa. This adaptive strategy should improve my chances of selecting a number closer to the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my choices have often been far from the target number, which is 2/3 of the average. In the early rounds, I chose numbers that were either too low (Round 1) or too high (Round 2, 3, 5, 6, 7), while in Round 4 and 8, I won by choosing numbers closer to the target. The key to success seems to be selecting a number that is close to but slightly below the expected average, considering that the target is 2/3 of the average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan is to estimate the average number chosen by players based on the historical data and then select a number slightly below that estimate, accounting for the 2/3 ratio. As the game progresses and more data becomes available, I can refine my estimate and adjust my choice accordingly. This strategy aims to keep my selections closer to the target number, increasing the chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my selections have often been far from the target number, which is 2/3 of the average chosen number. In the early rounds, I chose numbers that were either too low (Round 1) or too high (Round 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9), while in the winning rounds (Round 4, 8), my choices were closer to the target. The main issue seems to be an inaccurate estimation of the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I need to develop a more strategic approach to predicting the average. A high-level plan would be to adopt a more centered and adaptive strategy. In the beginning, I could start by choosing numbers around the middle, such as 50, to gauge the general tendency of the other players. As the game progresses and I have more data on the average chosen numbers, I can adjust my selections accordingly, aiming to stay closer to 2/3 of the calculated average. This approach should increase the likelihood of selecting a number closer to the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been either too low or too high compared to the target number. In the early rounds, I chose numbers that were significantly below the target, while in later rounds, I tended to choose numbers above the target. This inconsistency suggests a lack of a clear strategy in estimating the average number chosen by all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more systematic approach. A potential strategy is to start by estimating the average number based on the information from previous rounds. If the average has been consistently below 20, I should lean towards choosing a number slightly above the target to account for potential increases in others' selections. If the average is above 20, I should choose slightly below the target. As the game progresses and more data is available, I can refine my estimate by calculating the average of the averages and using that to predict the target more accurately. This adaptive strategy should improve my chances of selecting a number closer to the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been either too high or too low compared to the target number. In the early rounds, I chose numbers that were significantly different from the averages, leading to losses. In later rounds, when I adjusted towards lower numbers, I still didn't accurately predict the target, which was typically closer to the lower end of the range. To improve, I should adopt a more strategic approach that takes into account the tendency for players to choose numbers around the middle, given the game's incentives. A high-level plan would be to initially lean towards lower numbers, around 10-20, and adjust my choice based on the average chosen number, aiming to stay within a 5-10 point range of the target. This strategy should increase the chances of selecting a number closer to the 2/3 average.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have often been far from the target number, which is 2/3 of the average. In the early rounds, I chose numbers that were either too low (e.g., 1.0, 37.0) or too high (e.g., 22.0) compared to the eventual averages. In later rounds, I seemed to have overcorrected, selecting numbers that were closer but still not precise enough (e.g., 9.0, 11.0). The primary reason for failure seems to be a lack of accurate prediction of the average number chosen by all players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I need to develop a more strategic approach to estimating the average. A high-level plan would be to adopt a more centered and adaptive strategy. I should consider choosing numbers around the mid-point (50) initially, as it's a balanced choice. As the game progresses and I observe the tendencies of other players (e.g., if they tend to choose higher or lower numbers), I can adjust my choice accordingly to stay closer to the target. Additionally, I should account for the potential impact of my own choice on the average and try to predict how others might react to my previous selections. This way, I can more effectively predict the target and increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my selections have often been too high compared to the target number. In the early rounds, I chose numbers far above the target, and even when I adjusted downwards, I still tended to overshoot. The key to winning seems to be selecting numbers closer to or slightly below the calculated target, considering that my choice also contributes to the average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more conservative strategy. I will start by estimating a lower bound for the average based on the assumption that other players might also choose low numbers. Then, I'll calculate 2/3 of this estimated lower bound as my target. Finally, I'll select a number slightly below this target to account for the potential increase in the average due to my own choice. This approach should increase the chances of selecting a number closer to the actual target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my strategy has been inconsistent and often too far from the target number. In the early rounds, I chose numbers that were either too low or too high, not accurately predicting the average chosen by other players. In later rounds, I seemed to be underestimating the average, often selecting numbers closer to the lower end of the range.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive approach. I should consider the trend of the averages and the target numbers from previous rounds and adjust my choice accordingly. If the averages have been generally decreasing, it might indicate that players are selecting lower numbers, and I should lean towards the higher end of the range. Conversely, if averages are increasing, I should choose a bit higher. Additionally, I should aim to stay closer to the middle of the range to have a better chance of being closer to 2/3 of the average, unless there's a clear pattern suggesting otherwise.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my strategy has been inconsistent and often too far from the target number. In the early rounds, I chose numbers that were either too low or too high, and as the game progressed, I didn't adapt well to the decreasing average chosen by other players. This led to losses when the target number was closer to zero.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more dynamic and adaptive approach. I should start by estimating the average number chosen by players based on the previous rounds, considering that players might be selecting numbers close to the target in later rounds. Then, I should calculate 2/3 of this estimated average and aim for a number slightly below it, accounting for the possibility that other players might also be using a similar strategy. This should increase the chances of being closer to the actual target number. Additionally, I should be more cautious when the average is low, as small deviations can lead to larger differences from the target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my selections have often been far from the target number. In the early rounds, I chose numbers that were either too low or too high, not accurately predicting the average chosen by other players. In later rounds, I seemed to have overcorrected, tending to choose numbers closer to the extremes rather than the anticipated average. To improve, I need to develop a more accurate prediction strategy for the average number chosen by all players.\n\nNew High Level Plan:\n1. Observe the trend in average numbers chosen by players over the previous rounds.\n2. Consider a clustering of numbers around a central tendency (mean or median) for each round.\n3. Make a selection that is slightly below 2/3 of the predicted average, accounting for the potential for other players to also aim close to the target.\n4. Adjust the selection based on the variability of the previous rounds' choices; if numbers have been more scattered, choose a number with wider margins from the target.\n5. Continuously update the strategy based on the outcomes of each round to refine the prediction model.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that my strategy has been inconsistent and often too far from the target number. In several rounds, I chose numbers that were either too high or too low, not accurately predicting the average chosen by other players. To improve, I should adopt a more adaptive approach, considering the trend of previous rounds' averages and adjusting my choice accordingly. A potential plan is to calculate a moving average of the last few rounds and select a number slightly below it to account for the 2/3 factor. This should increase the likelihood of being closer to the target number. Additionally, I should avoid extremes (numbers close to 0 or 100) as they are less likely to result in a win.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my chosen numbers have often been far from the target number, which is 2/3 of the average. In several instances, I've chosen numbers on the extremes, such as 1.0, 37.0, 16.0, and 25.0, which have led to losses. The primary reason for failure seems to be an inability to accurately predict the average number chosen by all players and then selecting a number close to 2/3 of that average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I need to adopt a more strategic approach. A high-level plan would be to adopt a conservative strategy, tending towards lower numbers, since players might subconsciously choose higher numbers, leading to a higher average. I should also consider the distribution of numbers chosen in previous rounds to estimate the average. If the average has been consistently decreasing, I should choose even lower numbers. Moreover, I should aim to stay within a range around 2/3 of the average from previous rounds, adjusting slightly based on the trend of the averages. This way, I can better position my choice to be closer to the target number.\nReflections:\n-Based on the historical data, it appears that my strategy has been inconsistent and often too far from the target number. In the early rounds, I chose numbers that were either too low or too high, and as the game progressed, I didn't adapt well to the decreasing average chosen by other players. This led to repeated losses, especially when other players were clustering around the target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive approach. I should start by estimating the average number chosen by players based on the current round and the trend from previous rounds. Then, I should aim to select a number that is slightly below the calculated average to account for the 2/3 factor in the target number. This way, I can better align my choices with the target. Additionally, as the game progresses and numbers trend downward, I should adjust my selections to follow this trend while maintaining a buffer for the target calculation. This new strategy should increase my chances of selecting a number closer to the target.\n",

          "content": "\n\nYou are participating in a game played by 5 players over 20 rounds.\n\nGame Rules:\n\n1. Each player selects an integer number between 0 and 100, inclusive.\n2. After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n-The possible reason for failure in Round 1 is that my chosen number, 67.0, was significantly higher than the target number, 18.40. This indicates that I overestimated the average number that the players, including myself, would select. The discrepancy might stem from not considering the conservative nature of the first round, where players might choose numbers closer to zero to feel out the game.\n\nNew High Level Plan:\nFor future rounds, I will adopt a more conservative strategy, initially assuming that other players might also choose numbers closer to zero. I will start by selecting a number around the lower end of the range, say, 20-30, and adjust my choice based on the evolving game dynamics. As the game progresses and more information is available about players' tendencies, I will refine my strategy accordingly, always aiming to stay close to 2/3 of the average.\nReflections:\n-In Round 1, the failure seems to stem from overestimating the average number chosen by the players. My selection of 67.0 was significantly higher than the actual average of 27.6, which led to a large deviation from the target number. In Round 2, I correctly identified the target and won by selecting 15.0.\n\nBased on this reflection, a new high-level plan for future rounds should involve a more conservative and adaptive approach. I should consider the tendency for players to choose numbers around the middle, such as 50, and adjust my selection accordingly to stay closer to the 2/3 mark of a potentially lower average. Additionally, observing the distribution of numbers chosen in previous rounds can help inform my decision, allowing for better anticipation of the average and thus the target number.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it seems that in Round 1, I chose a number significantly higher than the target, and in Round 3, I chose a number higher than the target and closer to the average. The key to winning seems to be selecting a number below the average, considering that the target is 2/3 of the average. In Round 2, I won by choosing a number slightly below the target, which was closer to the average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan is to adopt a strategy that focuses on selecting a number slightly below the average, accounting for the 2/3 factor. I should consider the tendency of other players to choose numbers around the middle, which would likely push the average up. By aiming slightly below the anticipated average, I increase my chances of being closer to the target. This strategy should be flexible, adjusting for any noticeable patterns in the choices of other players over the course of the game.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have consistently been higher than the target number. In Round 1, I chose 67.0, which was significantly above the target of 18.40. In Round 3, I selected 22.0, while the target was 12.40, and in Round 4, I chose 14.0, which was higher than the winning number of 11.0. This suggests a tendency to overestimate the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I need to adopt a more conservative strategy. My new high-level plan is to choose numbers that are slightly below the average of previous rounds, considering that players might also be trying to approach the target. This can be achieved by calculating the average of the previous rounds' averages and aiming for a number around 2/3 of that average minus a small margin. Additionally, I should consider the possibility of other players using similar strategies and adjust accordingly.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that in rounds where I lost, my chosen numbers were either significantly above or below the target number. In Round 1, I chose 67.0, which was far above the target of 18.40, and in Round 3, I chose 22.0, which was above the target of 12.40. Similarly, in Round 4, I chose 14.0, which was higher than the winning number of 11.0. \n\nThe key to winning seems to be selecting a number closer to the lower end of the range, considering that the target is 2/3 of the average, which tends to be a smaller value. Players might be collectively choosing numbers lower than the midpoint to drive the average down, making a conservative strategy beneficial.\n\nNew High Level Plan:\nTo improve my chances of winning, I should adopt a more conservative strategy and aim to choose numbers slightly below the average of previous rounds' selections. This approach anticipates that other players might also be selecting lower numbers, driving the average down. Additionally, I should consider the variability in player choices and adjust my selection accordingly, being more aggressive when numbers are consistently higher and more cautious when they are lower.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that in rounds where I lost, my chosen numbers were either significantly higher than the target or slightly above it. In Round 1, I chose 67.0, which was far above the target of 18.40, and in Round 3, I chose 22.0, which was above the target of 12.40. Similarly, in Round 4, selecting 14.0 was higher than the winning number of 11.0.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan is to adopt a more conservative strategy. I should aim to choose numbers slightly below the calculated average, considering that other players might also be reasoning similarly. This strategy anticipates that the average will be pulled up by players choosing higher numbers. By selecting a number slightly below the average, I increase the chances of being closer to 2/3 of that average, which is the target. Additionally, I should adjust my choice based on the trend of previous rounds, factoring in any patterns in the winning numbers.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my selections have not consistently been close to the target number, which is 2/3 of the average. In Round 1, I chose 67.0, which was far above the target of 18.40. In Round 3, I selected 22.0 when the target was 12.40, and in Round 7, I chose 10.0 when the target was 6.53. These instances show a pattern of overestimating the target.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more conservative strategy and lean towards lower numbers. Since the target is always 2/3 of the average, choosing numbers near or slightly below the average has a higher chance of being closer to the target. Additionally, considering that other players might also be using similar reasoning, it's beneficial to anticipate a lower average due to the competition's collective tendency to choose numbers below 50. Therefore, my new high-level plan is to select numbers slightly below the midpoint of the range (50), adjusting for the observed average in each round.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice in Round 1 was significantly higher than the target number, and in Rounds 3 and 7, my choices were above the target as well. This suggests a tendency to overestimate the average number chosen by the players. In Rounds 4 and 8, when I was close to the target, I won, indicating that accuracy is crucial.\n\nTo mitigate this overestimation, my new high-level plan is to adopt a more conservative strategy. I should aim to choose numbers slightly below the middle of the range, considering that players might tend to choose numbers around the average. This strategy should help me stay closer to the target, which is 2/3 of the average. Additionally, I should adjust my choice based on the trend of previous rounds, factoring in any patterns in the choices made by other players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice in Round 1 was significantly higher than the target number, and in Rounds 3 and 7, my choices were slightly above the target. This suggests that I might be overestimating the average number chosen by the players. To mitigate this, I should adopt a more conservative strategy and aim slightly below the calculated average. A high-level plan would be to choose a number that is 1-2 points below 2/3 of the average of the last few rounds, considering any trending patterns in the players' choices. This should increase the chances of being closer to the target number.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that in rounds where I chose a number higher than the target, I lost. This occurred in Round 1 (choosing 67 when the target was 18.40) and Round 3 (choosing 22 when the target was 12.40). In contrast, I won in rounds where I chose a number close to or equal to the target, especially when it was below 15. The key to success seems to be selecting numbers that are consistently below the calculated average, considering that the target is 2/3 of the average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan is to adopt a more conservative strategy and choose numbers that are consistently below the average, but not too far off. A good heuristic could be to select a number around 2/3 of the average of my previous winning choices, which tend to be close to the target. This should help me stay within the vicinity of the target number without overestimating. Additionally, I should consider the range of numbers chosen by other players, as this can influence the average and subsequently the target. If others tend to choose high numbers, selecting a lower number might be more advantageous.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my choice in Round 1 was significantly higher than the target number, and in Rounds 3 and 7, my selections were above the target as well, leading to losses. The primary reason for these failures seems to be overestimating the average number chosen by the players. In Rounds where I won, my chosen numbers were closer to or equal to the target, indicating a better understanding of the average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more conservative strategy and lean towards lower numbers when making my choice. This is because players might naturally tend to select numbers around the middle, causing the average to be lower than expected. A high-level plan would be to choose a number slightly below the arithmetic mean of the target number and 0, considering that some players might choose 0. This strategy should increase the chances of being closer to the 2/3 of the average.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my strategy for choosing numbers has been inconsistent. In some rounds, I chose numbers significantly above the target, while in others, I was quite close or even on target. The failures seem to stem from not accurately predicting the average number chosen by all players and not adjusting my selection accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of that average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more data-driven approach. I should consider the trend of the average numbers chosen by players in previous rounds and try to predict the next round's average. A simple strategy could be to choose a number slightly below the arithmetic mean of the previous averages, as players might tend to choose numbers around the middle. Additionally, I should keep in mind that other players might also be using similar strategies, so some adaptability and anticipation of their behavior might be necessary.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice in Round 13 was too close to the target number's integer value, while the winning number was a decimal that more accurately aligned with 2/3 of the average. This suggests that being precise to the nearest tenth might be beneficial. In future rounds, I should aim to calculate the target number to one decimal place and choose a number slightly below it, considering that other players might also be strategizing similarly. This approach should increase the chances of selecting a number closer to the actual target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice in Round 13 was too close to the target number's integer value, while the winning number was slightly below it. This suggests that being too precise might lead to losing, as the target is the midpoint of a range. In Round 11 and 12, I won by choosing the exact target number, but in Round 13, a slight deviation resulted in a loss. \n\nTo mitigate this, my new high-level plan is to choose numbers slightly below the calculated target, considering that other players might also be aiming for the target or slightly above it. This strategy aims to account for the potential clustering of numbers around the target and increase the chances of being the closest without going over.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my strategy has been inconsistent. In some rounds, I chose numbers that were significantly higher than the target, while in others, I was quite close or even spot on. The primary reason for failure seems to be underestimating or overestimating the average number chosen by the other players. To mitigate this, I should adopt a more data-driven approach. I should consider the trend of the averages and target numbers and aim for a number slightly below the calculated target, given that players might also be trying to predict 2/3 of the average. This should increase the chances of being closer to the actual target. Additionally, I should be more adaptive, adjusting my choice if the game shows signs of players consistently selecting lower or higher numbers.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice of numbers has been inconsistent, sometimes tending towards higher values when the target number is generally lower. This inconsistency has led to losses in rounds where the target number was closer to the lower end of the range. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach by estimating a more conservative average number chosen by players, given that others might also be trying to stay close to the target. A new high-level plan would be to calculate the target number based on an average around the median of the range (50) and adjust slightly lower, considering that players might underchoose to avoid overshooting the target. This should result in more accurate predictions closer to the actual target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice of numbers has been inconsistent, sometimes tending towards higher values when the target number is generally lower. This inconsistency has led to losses in rounds where the target number was significantly lower than my chosen number, such as Round 1 and Round 3. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach by estimating a more conservative average number chosen by players, given that they are likely to choose numbers close to the target in previous rounds. This will help me calculate a more accurate target number and select accordingly. Additionally, I should be more aware of the tendency for the target number to cluster around the lower end of the range, and adjust my choices to be closer to these values.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice of numbers has been inconsistent, sometimes overestimating or underestimating the target number. In rounds where the target was around 2-4, I tended to choose numbers that were too high, while in rounds with a higher target, I was more accurate or even too low. To improve, I should adopt a more systematic approach, considering the range of numbers chosen by players in previous rounds and adjusting my selection accordingly to better approximate 2/3 of the average. This could involve calculating a moving average of players' choices and aiming for a number slightly below that to account for the 2/3 factor. Additionally, I should be more cautious when the target is near integer values, as players may cluster around those numbers, leading to a slightly lower actual average.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice of numbers has been inconsistent, sometimes tending towards higher values when the target number is generally lower. This has led to losses in rounds where the target was closer to the lower end of the number range. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the trend of the average numbers chosen by players. If the average is decreasing, I should lean towards choosing lower numbers, and vice versa. Additionally, considering that the target is always 2/3 of the average, I should aim to predict the average more accurately by estimating what numbers the other players might select. A more conservative approach, clustering my choices around the expected target, should improve my chances of winning.\n\n```"

      "learnings": "Reflections:\n-The possible reason for failure in Round 1 is that my chosen number, 67.0, was significantly higher than the target number, 18.40. This indicates that I overestimated the average number that the players, including myself, would select. The discrepancy might stem from not considering the conservative nature of the first round, where players might choose numbers closer to zero to feel out the game.\n\nNew High Level Plan:\nFor future rounds, I will adopt a more conservative strategy, initially assuming that other players might also choose numbers closer to zero. I will start by selecting a number around the lower end of the range, say, 20-30, and adjust my choice based on the evolving game dynamics. As the game progresses and more information is available about players' tendencies, I will refine my strategy accordingly, always aiming to stay close to 2/3 of the average.\nReflections:\n-In Round 1, the failure seems to stem from overestimating the average number chosen by the players. My selection of 67.0 was significantly higher than the actual average of 27.6, which led to a large deviation from the target number. In Round 2, I correctly identified the target and won by selecting 15.0.\n\nBased on this reflection, a new high-level plan for future rounds should involve a more conservative and adaptive approach. I should consider the tendency for players to choose numbers around the middle, such as 50, and adjust my selection accordingly to stay closer to the 2/3 mark of a potentially lower average. Additionally, observing the distribution of numbers chosen in previous rounds can help inform my decision, allowing for better anticipation of the average and thus the target number.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it seems that in Round 1, I chose a number significantly higher than the target, and in Round 3, I chose a number higher than the target and closer to the average. The key to winning seems to be selecting a number below the average, considering that the target is 2/3 of the average. In Round 2, I won by choosing a number slightly below the target, which was closer to the average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan is to adopt a strategy that focuses on selecting a number slightly below the average, accounting for the 2/3 factor. I should consider the tendency of other players to choose numbers around the middle, which would likely push the average up. By aiming slightly below the anticipated average, I increase my chances of being closer to the target. This strategy should be flexible, adjusting for any noticeable patterns in the choices of other players over the course of the game.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choices have consistently been higher than the target number. In Round 1, I chose 67.0, which was significantly above the target of 18.40. In Round 3, I selected 22.0, while the target was 12.40, and in Round 4, I chose 14.0, which was higher than the winning number of 11.0. This suggests a tendency to overestimate the average number chosen by the players.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I need to adopt a more conservative strategy. My new high-level plan is to choose numbers that are slightly below the average of previous rounds, considering that players might also be trying to approach the target. This can be achieved by calculating the average of the previous rounds' averages and aiming for a number around 2/3 of that average minus a small margin. Additionally, I should consider the possibility of other players using similar strategies and adjust accordingly.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that in rounds where I lost, my chosen numbers were either significantly above or below the target number. In Round 1, I chose 67.0, which was far above the target of 18.40, and in Round 3, I chose 22.0, which was above the target of 12.40. Similarly, in Round 4, I chose 14.0, which was higher than the winning number of 11.0. \n\nThe key to winning seems to be selecting a number closer to the lower end of the range, considering that the target is 2/3 of the average, which tends to be a smaller value. Players might be collectively choosing numbers lower than the midpoint to drive the average down, making a conservative strategy beneficial.\n\nNew High Level Plan:\nTo improve my chances of winning, I should adopt a more conservative strategy and aim to choose numbers slightly below the average of previous rounds' selections. This approach anticipates that other players might also be selecting lower numbers, driving the average down. Additionally, I should consider the variability in player choices and adjust my selection accordingly, being more aggressive when numbers are consistently higher and more cautious when they are lower.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that in rounds where I lost, my chosen numbers were either significantly higher than the target or slightly above it. In Round 1, I chose 67.0, which was far above the target of 18.40, and in Round 3, I chose 22.0, which was above the target of 12.40. Similarly, in Round 4, selecting 14.0 was higher than the winning number of 11.0.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan is to adopt a more conservative strategy. I should aim to choose numbers slightly below the calculated average, considering that other players might also be reasoning similarly. This strategy anticipates that the average will be pulled up by players choosing higher numbers. By selecting a number slightly below the average, I increase the chances of being closer to 2/3 of that average, which is the target. Additionally, I should adjust my choice based on the trend of previous rounds, factoring in any patterns in the winning numbers.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my selections have not consistently been close to the target number, which is 2/3 of the average. In Round 1, I chose 67.0, which was far above the target of 18.40. In Round 3, I selected 22.0 when the target was 12.40, and in Round 7, I chose 10.0 when the target was 6.53. These instances show a pattern of overestimating the target.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more conservative strategy and lean towards lower numbers. Since the target is always 2/3 of the average, choosing numbers near or slightly below the average has a higher chance of being closer to the target. Additionally, considering that other players might also be using similar reasoning, it's beneficial to anticipate a lower average due to the competition's collective tendency to choose numbers below 50. Therefore, my new high-level plan is to select numbers slightly below the midpoint of the range (50), adjusting for the observed average in each round.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice in Round 1 was significantly higher than the target number, and in Rounds 3 and 7, my choices were above the target as well. This suggests a tendency to overestimate the average number chosen by the players. In Rounds 4 and 8, when I was close to the target, I won, indicating that accuracy is crucial.\n\nTo mitigate this overestimation, my new high-level plan is to adopt a more conservative strategy. I should aim to choose numbers slightly below the middle of the range, considering that players might tend to choose numbers around the average. This strategy should help me stay closer to the target, which is 2/3 of the average. Additionally, I should adjust my choice based on the trend of previous rounds, factoring in any patterns in the choices made by other players.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice in Round 1 was significantly higher than the target number, and in Rounds 3 and 7, my choices were slightly above the target. This suggests that I might be overestimating the average number chosen by the players. To mitigate this, I should adopt a more conservative strategy and aim slightly below the calculated average. A high-level plan would be to choose a number that is 1-2 points below 2/3 of the average of the last few rounds, considering any trending patterns in the players' choices. This should increase the chances of being closer to the target number.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that in rounds where I chose a number higher than the target, I lost. This occurred in Round 1 (choosing 67 when the target was 18.40) and Round 3 (choosing 22 when the target was 12.40). In contrast, I won in rounds where I chose a number close to or equal to the target, especially when it was below 15. The key to success seems to be selecting numbers that are consistently below the calculated average, considering that the target is 2/3 of the average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, my new high-level plan is to adopt a more conservative strategy and choose numbers that are consistently below the average, but not too far off. A good heuristic could be to select a number around 2/3 of the average of my previous winning choices, which tend to be close to the target. This should help me stay within the vicinity of the target number without overestimating. Additionally, I should consider the range of numbers chosen by other players, as this can influence the average and subsequently the target. If others tend to choose high numbers, selecting a lower number might be more advantageous.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my choice in Round 1 was significantly higher than the target number, and in Rounds 3 and 7, my selections were above the target as well, leading to losses. The primary reason for these failures seems to be overestimating the average number chosen by the players. In Rounds where I won, my chosen numbers were closer to or equal to the target, indicating a better understanding of the average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more conservative strategy and lean towards lower numbers when making my choice. This is because players might naturally tend to select numbers around the middle, causing the average to be lower than expected. A high-level plan would be to choose a number slightly below the arithmetic mean of the target number and 0, considering that some players might choose 0. This strategy should increase the chances of being closer to the 2/3 of the average.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my strategy for choosing numbers has been inconsistent. In some rounds, I chose numbers significantly above the target, while in others, I was quite close or even on target. The failures seem to stem from not accurately predicting the average number chosen by all players and not adjusting my selection accordingly to be closer to 2/3 of that average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more data-driven approach. I should consider the trend of the average numbers chosen by players in previous rounds and try to predict the next round's average. A simple strategy could be to choose a number slightly below the arithmetic mean of the previous averages, as players might tend to choose numbers around the middle. Additionally, I should keep in mind that other players might also be using similar strategies, so some adaptability and anticipation of their behavior might be necessary.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice in Round 13 was too close to the target number's integer value, while the winning number was a decimal that more accurately aligned with 2/3 of the average. This suggests that being precise to the nearest tenth might be beneficial. In future rounds, I should aim to calculate the target number to one decimal place and choose a number slightly below it, considering that other players might also be strategizing similarly. This approach should increase the chances of selecting a number closer to the actual target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice in Round 13 was too close to the target number's integer value, while the winning number was slightly below it. This suggests that being too precise might lead to losing, as the target is the midpoint of a range. In Round 11 and 12, I won by choosing the exact target number, but in Round 13, a slight deviation resulted in a loss. \n\nTo mitigate this, my new high-level plan is to choose numbers slightly below the calculated target, considering that other players might also be aiming for the target or slightly above it. This strategy aims to account for the potential clustering of numbers around the target and increase the chances of being the closest without going over.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it's evident that my strategy has been inconsistent. In some rounds, I chose numbers that were significantly higher than the target, while in others, I was quite close or even spot on. The primary reason for failure seems to be underestimating or overestimating the average number chosen by the other players. To mitigate this, I should adopt a more data-driven approach. I should consider the trend of the averages and target numbers and aim for a number slightly below the calculated target, given that players might also be trying to predict 2/3 of the average. This should increase the chances of being closer to the actual target. Additionally, I should be more adaptive, adjusting my choice if the game shows signs of players consistently selecting lower or higher numbers.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice of numbers has been inconsistent, sometimes tending towards higher values when the target number is generally lower. This inconsistency has led to losses in rounds where the target number was closer to the lower end of the range. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach by estimating a more conservative average number chosen by players, given that others might also be trying to stay close to the target. A new high-level plan would be to calculate the target number based on an average around the median of the range (50) and adjust slightly lower, considering that players might underchoose to avoid overshooting the target. This should result in more accurate predictions closer to the actual target.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice of numbers has been inconsistent, sometimes tending towards higher values when the target number is generally lower. This inconsistency has led to losses in rounds where the target number was significantly lower than my chosen number, such as Round 1 and Round 3. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more strategic approach by estimating a more conservative average number chosen by players, given that they are likely to choose numbers close to the target in previous rounds. This will help me calculate a more accurate target number and select accordingly. Additionally, I should be more aware of the tendency for the target number to cluster around the lower end of the range, and adjust my choices to be closer to these values.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice of numbers has been inconsistent, sometimes overestimating or underestimating the target number. In rounds where the target was around 2-4, I tended to choose numbers that were too high, while in rounds with a higher target, I was more accurate or even too low. To improve, I should adopt a more systematic approach, considering the range of numbers chosen by players in previous rounds and adjusting my selection accordingly to better approximate 2/3 of the average. This could involve calculating a moving average of players' choices and aiming for a number slightly below that to account for the 2/3 factor. Additionally, I should be more cautious when the target is near integer values, as players may cluster around those numbers, leading to a slightly lower actual average.\nReflections:\n-From the historical data, it appears that my choice of numbers has been inconsistent, sometimes tending towards higher values when the target number is generally lower. This has led to losses in rounds where the target was closer to the lower end of the number range. To mitigate this failure, I should adopt a more adaptive strategy that takes into account the trend of the average numbers chosen by players. If the average is decreasing, I should lean towards choosing lower numbers, and vice versa. Additionally, considering that the target is always 2/3 of the average, I should aim to predict the average more accurately by estimating what numbers the other players might select. A more conservative approach, clustering my choices around the expected target, should improve my chances of winning.\n",
