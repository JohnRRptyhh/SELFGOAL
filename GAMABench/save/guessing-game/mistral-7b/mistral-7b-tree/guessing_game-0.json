After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Count the total number of players: Determine the total number of players in the game, including yourself.\n - Divide the sum by the total number of players: Divide the total sum of all numbers by the total number of players to obtain the manual average.\n - Continuously update the manual average: Keep track of the manual average after each round and update it accordingly to ensure accuracy.\n - Evaluate the accuracy of the winning number: Compare the winning number with the target number and identify any discrepancies or inconsistencies.\n - Continuously refine the calculation process: Based on the analysis of the calculation process in previous rounds, identify areas for improvement and refine the strategy to increase the chances of selecting a number closer to the target number.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Monitor the average and target numbers: Keep track of the average and target numbers in each round and analyze how they change based on the number of consecutive wins or losses. Do players who have winning streaks tend to choose numbers closer to the target, or do they drift further away from it?\n - Analyze winning numbers: Examine the winning numbers chosen by each player to determine if there is a trend or pattern in the numbers that are winning. For example, are winning numbers tending to be higher or lower than the average? Are there any specific numbers that have been winning multiple times?\n - Analyze the relationship between player performance and winning numbers: Determine if there is a correlation between a player's overall performance and their winning numbers. For example, do players who consistently choose numbers close to the target number have a higher overall win rate? Is there a specific relationship between a player's performance and their winning numbers (e.g., players who choose higher numbers have a higher win rate)?\n - Identify potential biases: Analyze the numbers chosen by individual players to identify any biases or patterns in their strategy. For example, some players may consistently choose higher or lower numbers, regardless of the outcome, or they may be influenced by the numbers chosen by other players.\n - Adjust strategy: Based on the current average and the target number, determine whether to choose a number closer to the average or further away, depending on the risk level you are willing to take.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Consider the range of possible numbers: Based on the previous results, the target number can range from very low to moderate numbers. Be prepared to switch between strategies that focus on low numbers and strategies that focus on moderate numbers.\n - Be open-minded: Be willing to experiment with new strategies and approaches, even if they seem unconventional. The game environment is constantly changing, and being open-minded can help you adapt to new challenges.\n - Practice quick decision-making: Develop the ability to make quick decisions based on incomplete information. In the game, you only have a limited amount of time to choose a number, so being able to make quick and informed decisions is crucial.\n - Adapt to the target: Be flexible and adjust your chosen number based on the target number. For instance, if the target number is significantly lower than the average, consider choosing a number closer to the target.\n - Learn from past mistakes: Review your previous choices and identify patterns or mistakes. For example, if you consistently choose numbers that are too high, consider choosing a lower number in the next round.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "
