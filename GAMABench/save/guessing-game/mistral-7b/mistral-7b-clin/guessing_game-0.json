After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nLearnings:\n- 1. Choosing a number exactly equal to the target may not be necessary for winning, as small deviations from the target can still result in a win. (Game Master: Winning Number: 13.0, while target was 28.40 in Round 1)\n2. Being closer to the average of all chosen numbers may be necessary to increase the chances of being closer to the target number. (Average Number Chosen: 42.6)\n3. Choosing a number significantly higher than the average may not contribute to being closer to the target number. (Player_0 chose 50.0, while the target was 28.40)\n4. Considering the potential impact of other players' choices on the average and target number may be necessary for effective strategy development.\n5. Choosing a number closer to the target (2/3 of the average) may be necessary to increase the chances of winning. (Target Number: 28.40, calculated as 2/3 of the average of 42.6)\nLearnings:\n-1. Choosing a number close to the average MAY BE NECCESSARY to increase the chances of being close to the target number.\n2. Choosing a number exactly equal to the target is NOT NECESSARY for winning, but being very close MAY BE NECCESSARY.\n3. Choosing a number significantly higher than the average DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to being closer to the target number.\n4. Considering other players' choices and their impact on the average and target number SHOULD BE NECCESSARY for effective strategy development.\n5.

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nLearnings:\n-1. Choosing a number close to the average MAY BE NECESSARY to have a chance at winning, as the target number is 2/3 of the average.\n2. Selecting a number significantly lower than the average MAY BE NECESSARY to be closer to the target number, since the target number is a fraction of the average.\n3. Focusing on the average of all numbers chosen, rather than individual selections, SHOULD BE NECESSARY to determine the optimal target number.\n4. Randomly selecting a number without considering the average DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to increasing the chances of winning.\n5. Choosing a number exactly equal to the target number SHOULD BE NECESSARY to guarantee a win, assuming no other player selects the same number.\n6. Considering the distribution of numbers chosen by other players MAY BE CONTRIBUTORY to determining the optimal number to choose, as it can affect the overall average.\n7. Overestimating or underestimating the average can lead to selecting a number that is too far from the target number, so it's important to make an accurate estimation.\n8. The more players in the game, the more diverse the number selections are likely to be, increasing the importance of considering the average and the distribution of numbers chosen by others.\nLearnings:\n-1.

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nLearnings:\n- 1. Choosing a number exactly equal to the target may not be necessary for winning, as small deviations from the target can still result in a win. (Game Master: Winning Number: 13.0, while the target was 28.40 in Round 1)\n2. Being closer to the average of all chosen numbers may be necessary to increase the chances of being closer to the target number. (Average Number Chosen: 42.6)\n3. Selecting a number significantly higher than the average may not contribute to being closer to the target number. (player_3 chose 50.0, while the target was 28.40)\n4. Considering the potential impact of other players' choices on the average and target number may be necessary for effective strategy development.\n5. Choosing a number closer to the target (2/3 of the average) may be necessary to increase the chances of winning. (Target Number: 28.40, calculated as 2/3 of the average number chosen)\nLearnings:\n-1. Choosing a number close to the target (2/3 of the average) MAY BE NECESSARY to increase the chances of winning.\n2. Being as close as possible to the average of all chosen numbers SHOULD BE NECCESSARY to increase the chances of being close to the target number.\n3.
