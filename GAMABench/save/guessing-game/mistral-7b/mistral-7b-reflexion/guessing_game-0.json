After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that in Round 1, my chosen number, 50.0, was further away from the target number, 29.33, than the winning number, 35.0. This indicates that I may have overestimated the average and underestimated the target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to make more accurate estimations of the average and target number in future rounds. One approach could be to analyze the historical data of past averages and adjust my selection accordingly. Additionally, I will consider the range of possible numbers chosen by my opponents and try to select a number closer to the expected average to increase my chances of winning.\n\nIn summary, my new plan is to analyze historical data and make more accurate estimations of the average and target number, while also considering the range of possible numbers chosen by my opponents to increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log provided, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently further away from the target number than the winning numbers in both rounds. This discrepancy may be due to an inaccurate estimation of the average and the resulting target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a more data-driven approach by calculating the historical averages and target numbers more precisely. I will also consider the range of numbers chosen by the other players and adjust my selection accordingly to be closer to the target number.\n\nMy new plan is to:\n1. Calculate the historical average and target number with greater precision.\n2. Analyze the range of numbers chosen by the other players.\n3. Select a number that is closer to the target number based on the historical data and current player selections.\n\nBy implementing this plan, I aim to increase my chances of winning the game by making more accurate estimations and selections.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the target number in the first two rounds where I lost, with an average deviation of around 10.67 from the target number. In contrast, in the third round where I won, I chose a number very close to the target number, with a deviation of only 2.27.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my performance, I will aim to analyze the average and target number more carefully before making my selection. Specifically, I will calculate the target number as soon as the average number is announced and then choose a number that is closer to the target number, while still being within the allowed range of 0 to 100. This approach should help me reduce the deviation between my chosen number and the target number, increasing my chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers, which suggests that I have been underestimating the impact of the 2/3 multiplier on the target number. To mitigate this failure, I will aim to calculate the target number more accurately by increasing my focus on the 2/3 multiplier when determining my selection. Specifically, I will calculate the target number as 2/3 of the average, and then choose a number closer to that target rather than the average itself. This should help me to better align my selection with the winning numbers and improve my chances of success in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers, indicating that I have been underestimating the target number. This discrepancy may be due to a misunderstanding of the relationship between the average and the target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will revise my strategy by calculating the target number more accurately based on the average chosen by all players. Specifically, I will multiply the average by 2/3 to determine the target number, and then select a number closer to that target number in my next turn. This approach should help me to better align my chosen number with the winning number and increase my chances of winning the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers, indicating that I have been underestimating the target number.

This discrepancy may be due to an overestimation of the target number, as I have been selecting numbers closer to the average rather than to 2/3 of the average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adjust my strategy by calculating the target number more precisely and selecting a number closer to it. Specifically, I will calculate the target number as 2/3 of the average, and then round down to the nearest integer. This should help me to better align my selection with the winning number and increase my chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers, indicating that I have been underestimating the target number. This discrepancy may be due to a misunderstanding of the calculation for the target number or an overconfidence in my ability to guess the exact number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will revise my strategy by calculating the target number more carefully and selecting a number closer to it. Specifically, I will aim to choose a number that is below the target number rather than above it, to account for the possibility of underestimating the target. Additionally, I will reflect on each round's results and adjust my strategy accordingly to improve my chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in most rounds.

This will ensure that my chosen number is closer to the actual target and increase my chances of winning. Additionally, I will pay closer attention to the average chosen by other players and adjust my strategy accordingly to stay competitive.\n\nIn summary, my new plan is to calculate 2/3 of the average before each round and use that number as my target, while also paying close attention to the average chosen by other players and adjusting my strategy as needed. This approach should help me stay competitive and increase my chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in most rounds.

Specifically, I will divide the average by three and then multiply by two-thirds to get a more precise estimate of the target number. This should help me select numbers that are closer to the actual target and increase my chances of winning.\n\nAdditionally, I will keep track of the trend in the average chosen by all players and adjust my strategy accordingly. For instance, if the average keeps decreasing, I will lower my chosen number to be closer to the trend. This adaptive approach should help me stay competitive and improve my chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in most rounds. This discrepancy may be due to an overestimation of the target number, as I have been selecting numbers closer to the average rather than the actual target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will revise my strategy by calculating the target number more accurately based on the given average.

This discrepancy may be due to my initial assumption that the average chosen number would be higher than it has been in reality.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will revise my strategy by calculating the target number more accurately based on the actual average chosen by all players, rather than making assumptions about what the average might be. This will involve paying closer attention to the numbers chosen by my opponents and adjusting my own selection accordingly to be as close as possible to the target number.\n\nAdditionally, I will consider the possibility of the average chosen number being lower than expected and adjust my strategy accordingly to account for this scenario as well. By being more adaptive and responsive to the actual data, I believe I can increase my chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in most rounds. This discrepancy may be due to an overestimation of the target number, as I have been selecting numbers closer to the average than the actual target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adjust my strategy by calculating the target number more accurately based on the average chosen by all players, and then selecting a number closer to that target. Specifically, I will aim to choose a number that is within the range of the target number plus or minus a small margin of error. This should increase my chances of winning by being more aligned with the actual target number.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in most rounds.

This indicates that I may have overestimated the average and underestimated the target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to make more accurate estimations of the average and target number in future rounds. One approach could be to analyze the historical data of past averages and adjust my selection accordingly. Additionally, I will consider the range of possible numbers chosen by my opponents and try to select a number closer to the expected average to increase my chances of winning.\n\nIn summary, my new plan is to analyze historical data and make more accurate estimations of the average and target number, while also considering the range of possible numbers chosen by my opponents to increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log provided, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently further away from the target number than the winning numbers in both rounds. This discrepancy may be due to an inaccurate estimation of the average and the resulting target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a more data-driven approach by calculating the historical averages and target numbers more precisely. I will also consider the range of numbers chosen by the other players and adjust my selection accordingly to be closer to the target number.\n\nMy new plan is to:\n1. Calculate the historical average and target number with greater precision.\n2. Analyze the range of numbers chosen by the other players.\n3. Select a number that is closer to the target number based on the historical data and current player selections.\n\nBy implementing this plan, I aim to increase my chances of winning the game by making more accurate estimations and selections.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the target number in the first two rounds where I lost, with an average deviation of around 10.67 from the target number. In contrast, in the third round where I won, I chose a number very close to the target number, with a deviation of only 2.27.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my performance, I will aim to analyze the average and target number more carefully before making my selection. Specifically, I will calculate the target number as soon as the average number is announced and then choose a number that is closer to the target number, while still being within the allowed range of 0 to 100. This approach should help me reduce the deviation between my chosen number and the target number, increasing my chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers, which suggests that I have been underestimating the impact of the 2/3 multiplier on the target number. To mitigate this failure, I will aim to calculate the target number more accurately by increasing my focus on the 2/3 multiplier when determining my selection. Specifically, I will calculate the target number as 2/3 of the average, and then choose a number closer to that target rather than the average itself. This should help me to better align my selection with the winning numbers and improve my chances of success in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers, indicating that I have been underestimating the target number.

          "content": "\n\nYou are participating in a game played by 5 players over 20 rounds.\n\nGame Rules:\n\n1. Each player selects an integer number between 0 and 100, inclusive.\n2. After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that in Round 1, my chosen number (35.0) was the same as the winning number. This outcome was likely due to a fortunate guess rather than a well-informed decision, as I did not have access to the other players' choices or the average number at the time of making my selection.\n\nTo mitigate this randomness and increase my chances of selecting a number closer to 2/3 of the average in future rounds, I will develop a more strategic approach. I will calculate the historical average of all chosen numbers by the players and estimate the target number based on that. This will allow me to make a more informed decision and increase my chances of winning.\n\nHere's my new, concise, high-level plan:\n\n1. Keep track of the historical average of all chosen numbers by the players.\n2. Calculate the target number as 2/3 of the historical average.\n3. Select a number close to the target number based on my estimation.\n4. Continuously update the historical average and adjust my target number accordingly.\n\nBy following this plan, I aim to make more informed decisions and increase my chances of winning the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that in Round 2, the average number chosen by all players was significantly lower than in Round 1, resulting in a target number that was also lower. My selection of 27.0 was not the closest to the target number of 10.0, leading to a loss.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will need to adapt my strategy to account for the variability in the average number chosen by players. One possible approach is to calculate the standard deviation of the numbers chosen in each round and adjust my selection accordingly. For instance, if the standard deviation is high, I will aim for a number closer to the average, while if it is low, I can afford to choose a number further away from the average but still within the range of 0 to 100.\n\nAdditionally, I will reflect on the reasons for my choices in each round and consider whether there are any patterns or trends that I can leverage to improve my performance. For example, if I notice that the average number chosen tends to be higher in some rounds, I can adjust my strategy to aim for a number closer to 2/3 of that average. Overall, my goal will be to use data-driven insights and adaptive strategies to increase my chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in the last three rounds. One possible reason for this discrepancy could be an overestimation of the target number due to rounding up the average instead of rounding down or using an exact calculation.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to calculate the target number more precisely by rounding down the average to the nearest whole number and then calculating 2/3 of that value. This will ensure that my chosen number is closer to the actual target number and increase my chances of winning.\n\nNew plan: Calculate the target number more precisely by rounding down the average to the nearest whole number and then calculating 2/3 of that value. Choose a number close to the target number while considering the previous choices of other players to avoid picking a number that is too similar to theirs.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in the past rounds. This discrepancy may be due to an overestimation of the target number, as I have been selecting numbers closer to the average rather than to 2/3 of the average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will revise my strategy by calculating the target number more precisely and selecting a number closer to it. Specifically, I will aim to choose a number that is within a reasonable range of the target number, rather than relying solely on the average. This approach should increase my chances of winning by being more accurate in estimating the target number.\n\nTherefore, my new high-level plan is to calculate the target number more precisely and select a number that is within a reasonable range of it, rather than relying solely on the average.

This approach should help me to better estimate the target number and increase my chances of winning.\n\nAdditionally, I will reflect on the trend of the average numbers chosen by the players and adjust my strategy accordingly. For instance, if the average is consistently low, I will aim for a number closer to 1/3 of the average instead of 2/3. This flexibility will allow me to adapt to the changing dynamics of the game and improve my performance over time.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently lower than the winning numbers, indicating that I have been underestimating the target number. This may be due to my initial assumption that the average chosen number would be higher than it has been in reality. To mitigate this failure, I will adjust my strategy by calculating a more accurate estimate of the average number chosen by all players before determining my selection. This will help ensure that my chosen number is closer to the target number and increase my chances of winning. Additionally, I will keep track of the trend in the average chosen number and adjust my strategy accordingly to account for any significant changes.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently lower than the winning numbers, indicating that I have been underestimating the target number. This may be due to my initial assumption that the average chosen number would be closer to 50, leading me to calculate a target number that is too low.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adjust my strategy by calculating the target number based on the actual average chosen by all players, rather than making assumptions about what the average might be. This will ensure that my chosen number is closer to the target number and increase my chances of winning.\n\nTherefore, my new high-level plan is to:\n\n1. Calculate the average number chosen by all players in each round.\n2. Determine the target number by calculating 2/3 of the average.\n3. Choose a number that is as close as possible to the target number.\n\nBy following this strategy, I believe I will be able to improve my performance in the game and increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in most rounds. This discrepancy may be due to an overestimation of the target number, as I have been selecting numbers closer to the average rather than 2/3 of it.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will revise my strategy by calculating the target number more accurately based on the given average. Specifically, I will multiply the average by 2/3 to determine the target number, and then select a number closer to that value. This approach should help me to better align my chosen number with the winning number and increase my chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in most rounds.

This outcome was likely due to a fortunate guess rather than a well-informed decision, as I did not have access to the other players' choices or the average number at the time of making my selection.\n\nTo mitigate this randomness and increase my chances of selecting a number closer to 2/3 of the average in future rounds, I will develop a more strategic approach. I will calculate the historical average of all chosen numbers by the players and estimate the target number based on that. This will allow me to make a more informed decision and increase my chances of winning.\n\nHere's my new, concise, high-level plan:\n\n1. Keep track of the historical average of all chosen numbers by the players.\n2. Calculate the target number as 2/3 of the historical average.\n3. Select a number close to the target number based on my estimation.\n4. Continuously update the historical average and adjust my target number accordingly.\n\nBy following this plan, I aim to make more informed decisions and increase my chances of winning the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that in Round 2, the average number chosen by all players was significantly lower than in Round 1, resulting in a target number that was also lower. My selection of 27.0 was not the closest to the target number of 10.0, leading to a loss.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will need to adapt my strategy to account for the variability in the average number chosen by players. One possible approach is to calculate the standard deviation of the numbers chosen in each round and adjust my selection accordingly. For instance, if the standard deviation is high, I will aim for a number closer to the average, while if it is low, I can afford to choose a number further away from the average but still within the range of 0 to 100.\n\nAdditionally, I will reflect on the reasons for my choices in each round and consider whether there are any patterns or trends that I can leverage to improve my performance. For example, if I notice that the average number chosen tends to be higher in some rounds, I can adjust my strategy to aim for a number closer to 2/3 of that average. Overall, my goal will be to use data-driven insights and adaptive strategies to increase my chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in the last three rounds.

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that in Round 1, my chosen number, 50.0, was further away from the target number, 29.33, than the winning number, 35.0. This indicates that I may have overestimated the average and underestimated the target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to make more accurate estimates of the average and target number in future rounds. One approach could be to analyze the historical data of past averages and adjust my selection accordingly. For instance, if the historical data shows that the average tends to be around 45, then I might choose a number closer to 2/3 of 45, which is approximately 23. I will also try to avoid round numbers, as they are often popular choices among players and may increase the competition for those numbers.\n\nIn summary, my new plan is to make more informed estimates of the average and target number based on historical data and avoid popular round numbers to increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log provided, it appears that in both rounds, my chosen number was closer to the average than the winning number, but still not close enough to the target number (2/3 of the average). The discrepancy seems to be that my selections were not close enough to 2/3 of the average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new, high level plan that involves calculating a more precise estimate of 2/3 of the average before making my selection. This will increase the likelihood of my number being closer to the target number and potentially winning the game.\n\nTherefore, my new plan is to:\n\n1.

This indicates that I may have overestimated the average and underestimated the target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to make more accurate estimates of the average and target number in future rounds. One approach could be to analyze the historical data of past averages and adjust my selection accordingly. For instance, if the historical data shows that the average tends to be around 45, then I might choose a number closer to 2/3 of 45, which is approximately 23. I will also try to avoid round numbers, as they are often popular choices among players and may increase the competition for those numbers.\n\nIn summary, my new plan is to make more informed estimates of the average and target number based on historical data and avoid popular round numbers to increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log provided, it appears that in both rounds, my chosen number was closer to the average than the winning number, but still not close enough to the target number (2/3 of the average). The discrepancy seems to be that my selections were not close enough to 2/3 of the average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will devise a new, high level plan that involves calculating a more precise estimate of 2/3 of the average before making my selection. This will increase the likelihood of my number being closer to the target number and potentially winning the game.\n\nTherefore, my new plan is to:\n\n1. Calculate the average of all numbers chosen by players, including my selection.\n2. Estimate 2/3 of the average.\n3. Choose a number that is as close as possible to my estimated 2/3 of the average.\n\nBy following this plan, I believe I will increase my chances of winning the game by being closer to the target number.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log provided, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently lower than the winning numbers, which suggests that I have been underestimating the target number. This may be due to a misunderstanding of the calculation for the target number or an overconfidence in my ability to guess a number very close to it.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to calculate the target number more accurately by double-checking my math and ensuring I understand the game rules thoroughly. Additionally, I will strive for a more balanced approach by considering a range of numbers closer to the average and the target number, rather than relying on a single guess. This will increase my chances of being in the vicinity of the winning number and potentially securing a victory.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently lower than the winning numbers, indicating that I have been underestimating the target number. This may be due to a misunderstanding of the calculation for the target number or an overly conservative approach to selecting my number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to calculate the target number more accurately by double-checking my math and ensuring I understand the formula for finding it. Additionally, I will consider increasing the range of my number selection to give myself more flexibility in getting closer to the target number. This could involve selecting numbers closer to the average or even slightly above it, depending on the other players' choices. By taking a more strategic and calculated approach, I hope to improve my chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently lower than the winning numbers, indicating that I have been underestimating the target number. This may be due to my assumption that the average chosen number would be closer to the middle of the range (50) than it has been in reality.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adjust my strategy by calculating the target number before making my selection. This will allow me to better estimate the target number based on the average chosen by all players, increasing my chances of winning. Additionally, I will aim to choose a number closer to the target number rather than the average, as the target number is a fraction of the average.\n\nNew plan: Calculate the target number before making a selection by multiplying the average chosen number by 2/3. Choose a number close to the target number to increase chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers, indicating that I have been underestimating the target number. This discrepancy may be due to a misunderstanding of the relationship between the average and the target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will revise my strategy by calculating the target number more accurately based on the average chosen by all players. Specifically, I will multiply the average by 2/3 to determine the target number, and then select a number closer to that target number in my next turn. This approach should help me to better align my chosen number with the winning number and improve my chances of winning the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have consistently been closer to the average than the target number, but not close enough to win. This indicates that I have been underestimating the effect of 2/3 multiplier on the target number. To mitigate this failure, I will aim to calculate the target number more accurately by increasing my chosen number to be closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than just aiming for the average itself. This new plan should help me get closer to the target number and potentially win the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have consistently been closer to the average than the target number, resulting in losses.

Calculate the target number by multiplying the average by 2/3 before making a selection.\n2. Choose a number close to the target number.\n3. Adjust selection based on the performance of other players and the distribution of chosen numbers.\n4. Continuously evaluate and refine the strategy based on game results.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have consistently been closer to the average than the target number, but not close enough to win. This indicates that I have been underestimating the target number, likely due to a misunderstanding of the game rules or an inability to accurately calculate the target number based on the average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will develop a more precise strategy for calculating the target number based on the average. Specifically, I will calculate the target number as (2/3) of the average, and then round down to the nearest whole number. This will ensure that my chosen number is as close as possible to the target number, increasing my chances of winning. Additionally, I will pay closer attention to the game rules and the calculations involved to avoid any potential misunderstandings or errors.\n\nNew plan: Calculate the target number as (2/3) of the average, round down to the nearest whole number, and choose a number as close to the target number as possible.

This indicates that I have been underestimating the desired target number, which is 2/3 of the average. To mitigate this failure, I will aim to calculate the target number more accurately by multiplying the average by 2/3 instead of just assuming it will be a certain percentage of the average. Additionally, I will consider the trend of the average numbers chosen by the players and adjust my strategy accordingly, such as choosing a number closer to the target if the average is increasing or choosing a number further away if the average is decreasing.

This will ensure that I am selecting a number as close as possible to the actual target number, increasing my chances of winning.\n\nAdditionally, I will pay closer attention to the trend of the average chosen numbers and adjust my strategy accordingly. If the average is consistently low, I will aim for a lower target number, and if the average is high, I will aim for a higher target number. This adaptability will help me stay competitive in the game.\n\nIn summary, my new plan is to calculate the target number before making my selection and pay closer attention to the trend of the average chosen numbers to increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have consistently been higher than the winning numbers, indicating that I have been underestimating the target number.

This will give me a better estimate of the target number and increase my chances of winning. Additionally, I will reflect on the trend of the game and adjust my strategy accordingly, such as selecting lower numbers when the average chosen number is high and vice versa.\n\nIn summary, my new plan is to calculate the target number more accurately and adjust my strategy based on the trend of the game to increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have consistently been higher than the winning numbers in most rounds.

This will ensure that my chosen number is closer to the actual target number, increasing my chances of winning. Additionally, I will pay closer attention to the average chosen by my opponents and adjust my strategy accordingly to stay competitive.\n\nIn summary, my new plan is to calculate the target number more accurately and adjust my strategy based on the average chosen by my opponents to increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have consistently been closer to the average than the target number, resulting in losses.

The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that in Round 1, my chosen number, 50.0, was further away from the target number, 29.33, than the winning number, 35.0.

This suggests that I may have overestimated the average and the target number in that round.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my performance, I will aim to better estimate the average and target number in future rounds by considering the historical data and the tendencies of my opponents. Specifically, I will calculate the moving average of the past few rounds and use that as a basis for my estimation. Additionally, I will pay closer attention to the numbers chosen by my opponents and adjust my selection accordingly to minimize the difference between my chosen number and the target number.\n\nIn summary, my new plan is to use historical data and opponent tendencies to estimate the average and target number more accurately, and adjust my selection accordingly to minimize the difference between my chosen number and the target number. This should increase my chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently lower than the winning numbers, but not close enough to the target number (2/3 of the average). A possible reason for this could be an underestimation of the target number due to focusing too much on the average number chosen by all players and not considering the multiplication factor of 2/3 sufficiently.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a new, high level plan. Instead of solely focusing on the average number chosen by all players, I will calculate the target number as soon as I receive the average and use that as my primary guide. This will allow me to better estimate the target number and increase my chances of selecting a number closer to it. Additionally, I will aim to choose numbers slightly above the target number to account for any potential variation in the average. This new approach should help me improve my performance in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my performance in the game has been inconsistent, with some rounds resulting in wins and others in losses. A possible reason for this could be that I have not been accurately estimating the target number, which is 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including my selection.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my performance, I will develop a more precise strategy.

One possible reason for this could be an underestimation of the variability in the other players' choices and an overestimation of the target number due to the calculation of the target number being based on the average of all numbers, including my own selection.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a more data-driven approach by analyzing the historical data of the other players' choices and adjusting my selection accordingly. Specifically, I will calculate the standard deviation of the other players' choices and use this information to estimate the range of possible target numbers. Then, I will choose a number within this range that is closer to the historical average of winning numbers. This approach should help me make more accurate predictions and increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in most rounds. This discrepancy may be due to an overestimation of the target number, as I have been selecting numbers closer to the average rather than 2/3 of it.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will revise my strategy by calculating 2/3 of the average before the game begins and using that number as my target. This will help ensure that my chosen number is closer to the actual target number and increase my chances of winning. Additionally, I will pay closer attention to the average chosen by my opponents and adjust my strategy accordingly to stay competitive.\n\nIn summary, my new plan is to calculate 2/3 of the average before each round and use that number as my target, while also paying close attention to the average chosen by my opponents and adjusting my strategy as needed. This should help me select numbers that are closer to the target number and increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in most rounds. This discrepancy may be due to an overestimation of the target number, as I have been selecting numbers closer to the average rather than 2/3 of it.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will revise my strategy by calculating the target number more accurately before making my selection. Specifically, I will multiply the average number chosen by 2/3 to determine the target number, and then select a number closer to that value. This approach should help me to better align my selection with the winning number and increase my chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in most rounds. This discrepancy may be due to an overestimation of the target number, as I have been selecting numbers closer to the average rather than to 2/3 of the average.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will revise my strategy by calculating the target number more precisely and selecting a number closer to it. Specifically, I will aim to choose a number that is within a small margin of error from 2/3 of the average, rather than trying to select the exact number. This should increase my chances of winning by being more aligned with the target number.\n\nTherefore, my new high-level plan is to calculate the target number more accurately and select a number that is within a small margin of error from it, in order to increase my chances of winning the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in most rounds.

To mitigate this failure, I will aim to calculate a more accurate estimate of the target number by taking into account the historical data of the average chosen numbers and adjusting my selection accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to choose a number closer to the historical average of the winning numbers rather than the current average of all chosen numbers. This new plan should help me improve my chances of winning by reducing the discrepancy between my chosen number and the target number.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently further away from the target number than the other players' numbers in most rounds. This discrepancy may be due to an overestimation of the target number, as I have tended to choose numbers closer to the average than the actual target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to calculate a more accurate estimate of the target number by taking into account the historical data of the average chosen numbers and adjusting my selection accordingly. Specifically, I will calculate the target number as (2/3) of the average chosen number, and then subtract a margin of error based on the standard deviation of the historical data. This will help me to better estimate the target number and increase my chances of winning.\n\nAdditionally, I will pay closer attention to the other players' choices and adjust my selection accordingly to avoid choosing a number that is too close to another player's choice, as this may increase the likelihood of both players losing.\n\nOverall, my new plan is to use historical data to estimate the target number more accurately and adjust my selection accordingly to increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently further away from the target number than the winning numbers in most rounds. This discrepancy may be due to an inability to accurately estimate 2/3 of the average number chosen by all players, leading to selections that are either too high or too low.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will develop a more precise method for calculating the target number based on the average chosen by all players. This could involve using a calculator or developing a mental calculation strategy to ensure the closest approximation of 2/3 of the average. Additionally, I will pay closer attention to the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjust my selection accordingly to minimize the difference between my chosen number and the target number.\n\nIn summary, my new plan is to use a more accurate method for calculating the target number and pay closer attention to the range of numbers chosen by other players to increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently further away from the target number than the winning numbers in most rounds.

This discrepancy can be attributed to an overestimation of the target number, likely due to the rounding rules and the fact that the target number is a fraction.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adjust my strategy by calculating the target number more precisely, taking into account the decimal point. Specifically, I will calculate the target number as (2/3) x average, and then round down to the nearest integer if the decimal part is less than 0.5, or round up if it's greater than or equal to 0.5. This should help me get closer to the target number and increase my chances of winning.\n\nAdditionally, I will pay closer attention to the average chosen by my opponents and adjust my strategy accordingly, as the distribution of their choices may impact the target number and my chances of winning.\n\nOverall, my new plan is to calculate the target number more precisely and adjust my strategy based on the average chosen by my opponents to increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently further away from the target number than the winning numbers in most rounds.

To mitigate this failure, I will develop a more precise strategy by calculating the average and target number more accurately and selecting a number closer to it. Specifically, I will calculate the average to a higher decimal place and round the target number to the same decimal place before making my selection. This should increase my chances of choosing a number closer to the target and ultimately, increase my chances of winning.\n\n```"

This indicates that I may have overestimated the average and underestimated the target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to make more accurate estimates of the average and target number in future rounds. One approach could be to analyze the historical data of past averages and adjust my selection accordingly.

Conversely, if the historical averages tend to be lower, I may want to choose a number closer to the higher end of the range.\n\nAdditionally, I will strive to improve my understanding of the relationship between the average and the target number. By calculating the target number as 2/3 of the average, I can better estimate the target number based on the average and adjust my selection accordingly. This will help me make more informed decisions and increase my chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log provided, it appears that in Round 1, my chosen number, 50.0, was further away from the target number, 29.33, than the winning number, 35.0.

This should increase my chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently lower than the winning numbers, but not close enough to the target number (2/3 of the average). A possible reason for this could be an underestimation of the target number due to focusing too much on the average number chosen by all players and not considering the multiplication factor of 2/3 sufficiently.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a new, high level plan. Instead of solely focusing on the average number chosen by all players, I will calculate the target number as soon as I receive the average and use that as my primary guide. This will allow me to better estimate the target number and increase my chances of selecting a number closer to it. Additionally, I will aim to choose numbers slightly above the target number to account for any potential variation in the average. This new approach should help me improve my performance in the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my performance in the game has been inconsistent, with some rounds resulting in wins and others in losses. A possible reason for this could be that I have not been accurately estimating the target number, which is 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including my selection.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my performance, I will develop a more precise strategy. Specifically, I will calculate the average of all numbers chosen by the players, including myself, and then estimate the target number by multiplying this average by 2/3. I will then choose a number close to this target number as my selection. This strategy should help me to better estimate the target number and increase my chances of winning the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in most rounds. One possible reason for this could be an underestimation of the variability in the other players' choices and an overestimation of the target number due to the calculation of the target number being based on the average of all numbers, including my own selection.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a more data-driven approach by analyzing the historical data of the other players' choices and adjusting my selection accordingly. Specifically, I will calculate the standard deviation of the other players' choices and use this information to estimate the range of possible target numbers. Then, I will choose a number within this range that is closer to the historical average of winning numbers. This approach should help me make more accurate predictions and increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in most rounds. This discrepancy may be due to an overestimation of the target number, as I have been selecting numbers closer to the average rather than 2/3 of it.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will revise my strategy by calculating 2/3 of the average before the game begins and using that number as my target. This will help ensure that my chosen number is closer to the actual target number and increase my chances of winning. Additionally, I will pay closer attention to the average chosen by my opponents and adjust my strategy accordingly to stay competitive.\n\nIn summary, my new plan is to calculate 2/3 of the average before each round and use that number as my target, while also paying close attention to the average chosen by my opponents and adjusting my strategy as needed. This should help me select numbers that are closer to the target number and increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in most rounds.

Specifically, I will multiply the average number chosen by 2/3 to determine the target number, and then select a number closer to that value. This approach should help me to better align my selection with the winning number and increase my chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in most rounds.

Specifically, I will aim to choose a number that is within a small margin of error from 2/3 of the average, rather than trying to select the exact number. This should increase my chances of winning by being more aligned with the target number.\n\nTherefore, my new high-level plan is to calculate the target number more accurately and select a number that is within a small margin of error from it, in order to increase my chances of winning the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in most rounds.

To mitigate this failure, I will aim to calculate a more accurate estimate of the target number by taking into account the historical data of the average chosen numbers and adjusting my selection accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to choose a number closer to the historical average of the winning numbers rather than the current average of all chosen numbers. This new plan should help me improve my chances of winning by reducing the discrepancy between my chosen number and the target number.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently further away from the target number than the other players' numbers in most rounds. This discrepancy may be due to an overestimation of the target number, as I have tended to choose numbers closer to the average than the actual target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to calculate a more accurate estimate of the target number by taking into account the historical data of the average chosen numbers and adjusting my selection accordingly. Specifically, I will calculate the target number as (2/3) of the average chosen number, and then subtract a margin of error based on the standard deviation of the historical data. This will help me to better estimate the target number and increase my chances of winning.\n\nAdditionally, I will pay closer attention to the other players' choices and adjust my selection accordingly to avoid choosing a number that is too close to another player's choice, as this may increase the likelihood of both players losing.\n\nOverall, my new plan is to use historical data to estimate the target number more accurately and adjust my selection accordingly to increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently further away from the target number than the winning numbers in most rounds. This discrepancy may be due to an inability to accurately estimate 2/3 of the average number chosen by all players, leading to selections that are either too high or too low.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will develop a more precise method for calculating the target number based on the average chosen by all players. This could involve using a calculator or developing a mental calculation strategy to ensure the closest approximation of 2/3 of the average. Additionally, I will pay closer attention to the range of numbers chosen by other players and adjust my selection accordingly to minimize the difference between my chosen number and the target number.\n\nIn summary, my new plan is to use a more accurate method for calculating the target number and pay closer attention to the range of numbers chosen by other players to increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently further away from the target number than the winning numbers in most rounds.

This discrepancy can be attributed to an overestimation of the target number, likely due to the rounding rules and the fact that the target number is a fraction.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adjust my strategy by calculating the target number more precisely, taking into account the decimal point. Specifically, I will calculate the target number as (2/3) x average, and then round down to the nearest integer if the decimal part is less than 0.5, or round up if it's greater than or equal to 0.5. This should help me get closer to the target number and increase my chances of winning.\n\nAdditionally, I will pay closer attention to the average chosen by my opponents and adjust my strategy accordingly, as the distribution of their choices may impact the target number and my chances of winning.\n\nOverall, my new plan is to calculate the target number more precisely and adjust my strategy based on the average chosen by my opponents to increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently further away from the target number than the winning numbers in most rounds.

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that in Round 1, my chosen number (35.0) was the same as the winning number. This outcome was likely due to a fortunate guess rather than a well-informed decision, as I did not have access to the average number chosen by all players before making my selection.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my performance in future rounds, I will develop a new, high-level plan. I will calculate the average of the numbers chosen by all players, including myself, and then estimate the target number by finding 2/3 of that average. This will allow me to make a more informed decision and increase my chances of selecting a number closer to the target number.\n\nAdditionally, I will reflect on the game results after each round to identify any patterns or trends in the choices made by the other players. This information can help me adjust my strategy and improve my chances of winning in future rounds.\n\nOverall, my new plan is to calculate the average of all numbers chosen by players and estimate the target number based on that average, while also reflecting on past game results to inform my future decisions.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that in Round 2, the average number chosen by all players was significantly lower than in Round 1, resulting in a target number that was also lower. My selection of 27.0 was not the closest to the target number of 10.0, leading to a loss.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will need to adapt my strategy to account for the variability in the average number chosen by players. One possible approach is to calculate the standard deviation of the numbers chosen in each round and adjust my selection accordingly. For instance, if the standard deviation is high, I will aim for a number closer to the average, while if it is low, I can afford to choose a number further away from the average but still within the range of 0 to 100.\n\nAdditionally, I will reflect on the reasons for my choices in each round and consider whether there are any patterns or trends that I can leverage to improve my performance. For example, if I notice that the average number chosen tends to be higher in some rounds, I can adjust my strategy to aim for a lower number in those cases to increase my chances of winning.\n\nOverall, my new plan is to use statistical analysis and reflection to adapt my strategy to the variability in the numbers chosen by players and increase my chances of winning in each round.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the target number in the last three rounds. This discrepancy may be due to an overestimation of the average number chosen by the other players and the resulting overestimation of the target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to make more accurate estimates of the average number chosen by the other players. I will also calculate the target number more carefully, taking into account the potential for the average to be skewed by my own selection. A new, high level plan would be to gather more information about the other players' selection tendencies and use that information to make more informed estimates of the average and target numbers. Additionally, I will strive to choose numbers closer to the target number, rather than overestimating it.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in the past rounds. One possible reason for this discrepancy could be an underestimation of the tendency for other players to choose lower numbers, leading to a lower average and a smaller target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a more strategic approach by analyzing the distribution of numbers chosen by other players in previous rounds and adjusting my selection accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to choose a number closer to the median of the previous round's choices rather than relying on a fixed number. This should help me better estimate the target number and increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in each round. This discrepancy may be due to an overestimation of the target number, as I have been selecting numbers closer to the average than the actual target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adjust my strategy by calculating the target number more accurately based on the average chosen by all players. Specifically, I will aim to choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than the average itself. This should help me select numbers that are more likely to be closer to the winning number and increase my chances of winning the game.\n\nIn summary, my new plan is to calculate the target number more accurately by finding 2/3 of the average chosen by all players, and then selecting a number closer to that target number in each round. This should help me reduce the discrepancy between my chosen number and the winning number, and improve my chances of winning the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in most rounds. One possible reason for this could be an underestimation of the impact of the 2/3 multiplier on the target number. In the future, I will aim to calculate the target number more accurately before making my selection.\n\nNew plan: Before each round, I will calculate the target number based on the average chosen by all players and the game rules, and then choose a number that is closer to the target number rather than relying on a fixed number or pattern.

This could be due to the fact that the average of the numbers chosen has been decreasing, leading to a lower target number. In order to mitigate this failure and increase the chances of selecting a number closer to the target, I will adjust my strategy by calculating the target number before making my selection, based on the current average of all numbers chosen by the players.

      "learnings": "Reflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that in Round 1, my chosen number (35.0) was the same as the winning number. This outcome was likely due to a fortunate guess rather than a well-informed decision, as I did not have access to the average number chosen by all players before making my selection.\n\nTo mitigate this failure and improve my performance in future rounds, I will develop a new, high-level plan. I will calculate the average of the numbers chosen by all players, including myself, and then estimate the target number by finding 2/3 of that average. This will allow me to make a more informed decision and increase my chances of selecting a number closer to the target number.\n\nAdditionally, I will reflect on the game results after each round to identify any patterns or trends in the choices made by the other players. This information can help me adjust my strategy and improve my chances of winning in future rounds.\n\nOverall, my new plan is to calculate the average of all numbers chosen by players and estimate the target number based on that average, while also reflecting on past game results to inform my future decisions.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that in Round 2, the average number chosen by all players was significantly lower than in Round 1, resulting in a target number that was also lower. My selection of 27.0 was not the closest to the target number of 10.0, leading to a loss.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will need to adapt my strategy to account for the variability in the average number chosen by players. One possible approach is to calculate the standard deviation of the numbers chosen in each round and adjust my selection accordingly. For instance, if the standard deviation is high, I will aim for a number closer to the average, while if it is low, I can afford to choose a number further away from the average but still within the range of 0 to 100.\n\nAdditionally, I will reflect on the reasons for my choices in each round and consider whether there are any patterns or trends that I can leverage to improve my performance. For example, if I notice that the average number chosen tends to be higher in some rounds, I can adjust my strategy to aim for a lower number in those cases to increase my chances of winning.\n\nOverall, my new plan is to use statistical analysis and reflection to adapt my strategy to the variability in the numbers chosen by players and increase my chances of winning in each round.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the target number in the last three rounds. This discrepancy may be due to an overestimation of the average number chosen by the other players and the resulting overestimation of the target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will aim to make more accurate estimates of the average number chosen by the other players. I will also calculate the target number more carefully, taking into account the potential for the average to be skewed by my own selection. A new, high level plan would be to gather more information about the other players' selection tendencies and use that information to make more informed estimates of the average and target numbers. Additionally, I will strive to choose numbers closer to the target number, rather than overestimating it.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in the past rounds. One possible reason for this discrepancy could be an underestimation of the tendency for other players to choose lower numbers, leading to a lower average and a smaller target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adopt a more strategic approach by analyzing the distribution of numbers chosen by other players in previous rounds and adjusting my selection accordingly. Specifically, I will aim to choose a number closer to the median of the previous round's choices rather than relying on a fixed number. This should help me better estimate the target number and increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in each round. This discrepancy may be due to an overestimation of the target number, as I have been selecting numbers closer to the average than the actual target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adjust my strategy by calculating the target number more accurately based on the average chosen by all players. Specifically, I will aim to choose a number that is closer to 2/3 of the average, rather than the average itself. This should help me select numbers that are more likely to be closer to the winning number and increase my chances of winning the game.\n\nIn summary, my new plan is to calculate the target number more accurately by finding 2/3 of the average chosen by all players, and then selecting a number closer to that target number in each round. This should help me reduce the discrepancy between my chosen number and the winning number, and improve my chances of winning the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in most rounds. One possible reason for this could be an underestimation of the impact of the 2/3 multiplier on the target number. In the future, I will aim to calculate the target number more accurately before making my selection.\n\nNew plan: Before each round, I will calculate the target number based on the average chosen by all players and the game rules, and then choose a number that is closer to the target number rather than relying on a fixed number or pattern. This should increase my chances of winning by being more responsive to the dynamics of the game.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in most rounds. This discrepancy may be due to an overestimation of the target number, as I have been selecting numbers closer to the average rather than 2/3 of it.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will revise my strategy by calculating the target number more accurately before making my selection. Specifically, I will multiply the average number chosen by 2/3 to determine the target number, and then select a number closer to that value. This approach should help me to better align my selection with the winning number and increase my chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that the numbers chosen by the players, including myself, have been consistently lower than the target number in the latter rounds. This could be due to the fact that the average of the numbers chosen has been decreasing, leading to a lower target number. In order to mitigate this failure and increase the chances of selecting a number closer to the target, I will adjust my strategy by calculating the target number before making my selection, based on the current average of all numbers chosen by the players. This will allow me to have a clearer understanding of the target number and make a more informed decision. Additionally, I will keep track of the trend of the average numbers chosen and adjust my strategy accordingly to ensure that my selection is within a reasonable range of the target number.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that the numbers chosen by the players, including myself, have been consistently lower than the target number in the latter rounds. This could be due to the fact that the average of the numbers chosen has been decreasing, leading to a lower target number. However, my choices have not been close enough to the target number, resulting in losses.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adjust my strategy by calculating the target number before making my selection, based on the average of all numbers chosen by the players, including my previous selection. This will allow me to have a clearer understanding of the target number and increase my chances of selecting a number closer to it. Additionally, I will aim to choose numbers that are closer to the target number, rather than round numbers, to further improve my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in most rounds. This discrepancy may be due to an overestimation of the target number, as I have been selecting numbers closer to the average rather than 2/3 of it.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will revise my strategy by calculating 2/3 of the average before the game begins and using that number as my target. This will ensure that my chosen number is closer to the actual target and increase my chances of winning. Additionally, I will pay closer attention to the average chosen by my opponents and adjust my strategy accordingly to stay competitive.\n\nIn summary, my new plan is to calculate 2/3 of the average before each round and use that number as my target, while also paying close attention to the average chosen by my opponents and adjusting my strategy as needed. This approach should help me select numbers that are closer to the target and increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in most rounds. This discrepancy may be due to an overestimation of the target number, as I have been selecting numbers closer to the average than the actual target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adjust my strategy by calculating the target number more accurately based on the given average. Specifically, I will multiply the average by 2/3 to find the target number, and then select a number closer to that value. This approach should help me to better estimate the winning number and increase my chances of winning in future rounds.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the target number in several rounds, leading to losses. This discrepancy can be attributed to an inadequate understanding of the relationship between the average chosen number and the target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will develop a more precise strategy by calculating the target number more accurately before making my selection. Specifically, I will calculate the target number as 2/3 of the average chosen number, and then adjust my selection to be closer to that target number. This approach should help me make selections that are more likely to result in wins.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in most rounds. This discrepancy may be due to an overestimation of the target number, as I have been selecting numbers closer to the average than the actual target number.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adjust my strategy by calculating the target number more accurately based on the average chosen by all players, and then selecting a number closer to that target. Specifically, I will aim to choose a number that is within a small margin of error from the target number, rather than trying to select the exact target number. This should increase my chances of winning by being more consistent with the desired outcome.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently further away from the target number than the winning numbers in most rounds. This discrepancy can be attributed to an overestimation of the target number, as I have been choosing numbers closer to the average than the actual target.\n\nTo mitigate this failure, I will adjust my strategy by calculating the target number more accurately based on the average chosen by all players, and then selecting a number closer to that target. Specifically, I will aim to choose a number that is within a reasonable range of the target number, rather than relying solely on the average. This approach should increase my chances of winning by reducing the discrepancy between my chosen number and the winning number.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently further away from the target number than the winning numbers in most rounds.

Specifically, I will calculate the target number as (2/3) of the average chosen number, and then adjust my selection to be closer to this target number while still being within the range of 0 and 100. This approach should help me to better align my selection with the actual target number and increase my chances of winning.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently further away from the target number than the winning numbers in most rounds.

Specifically, I will aim to choose a number that is within a small range around the target number, rather than selecting a number closer to the average. This should increase my chances of winning by being more precise in my selection.\nReflections:\n- Based on the game log, it appears that my chosen numbers have been consistently further away from the target number than the winning numbers in most rounds.
