After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Analyze Spread: Calculate the spread of numbers chosen by other players in the previous rounds. The spread is the difference between the highest and lowest numbers chosen.\n - Adapt to Changing Spread: If the spread varies between rounds, be prepared to adapt the strategy accordingly. In some rounds, it might be better to focus on the average, while in others, focusing on popular choices might be more effective.\n - Anticipate Future Spread: Based on the trends observed in the spread, try to anticipate whether it will be large or narrow in future rounds. This anticipation can help inform the strategy for the upcoming rounds.\n - Continuously Evaluate Performance: Regularly assess the success of the chosen strategy based on the outcomes of previous rounds. If the strategy is not leading to wins, consider adjusting it or trying a different approach.\n - Adapt to Changing Averages: Be prepared to adjust your choice based on the average of the round. For example, if the average is significantly higher or lower than the popular choices, consider selecting a number closer to the average while still keeping the popular choices in mind.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Consider the impact of your own choices: Your choices in rounds 11, 12, and 18 were close to the group's average and resulted in wins. In contrast, choosing a higher number in rounds 13 and 15 led to losses. Sticking close to the group's average seems to be a more successful strategy.\n - Fine-grained goals for the next few rounds: {'Focus on the range between 3.2 and 6': 'as this has been the most stable range in the recent history of the game.', \"Choose a number close to the group's average\": 'as this has been a successful strategy in the past.', 'Be prepared to adapt your strategy': \"if the group's average changes significantly or if there are new outliers.\", 'Continuously monitor the game log': 'to identify any patterns or trends that could inform future strategies.'}\n - Focus on the 4-6 range: Since this range has proven to be successful for player_1, aim to keep the chosen number within this range.\n - Be cautious with higher numbers: Avoid choosing numbers significantly higher than 6, as these rounds have generally resulted in losses for player_1.\n - Analyze the impact of lower numbers: While lower numbers (below 4) have occasionally led to wins, they have also resulted in losses. Evaluate the potential risks and benefits before choosing numbers outside the 4-6 range.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

        "55": "Maintain Consistency: While adjusting the chosen number based on the group's average, try to maintain a certain level of consistency to avoid appearing unpredictable or erratic. This can help in avoiding being targeted by other players who might try to exploit inconsistencies in player_1's strategy.",
        "56": "Avoid overreaction: While it is important to adjust the chosen number based on the observed trend, player_1 should avoid overreacting to short-term fluctuations in the group's average. Instead, they should focus on the longer-term trend and make informed decisions based on this trend.",
        "57": "Observe recent averages: The group's average has been fluctuating between 3 and 13, with most rounds having an average between 4 and 6. It would be beneficial to focus on these recent averages when making an estimate.",
        "58": "Identify patterns in winning numbers: In many rounds, the winning number is the same as the average or very close to it. This suggests that players might be targeting the average or slightly below it.",
        "59": "Consider your past choices: You have won when choosing lower numbers, especially when the average is around 5 or above. However, choosing a number significantly lower than the average has led to losses. This indicates that while being below the average can be beneficial, being too far below might not be the best strategy.",
        "60": "Adjust estimate based on previous round: If the previous round's average is significantly different from the recent averages, consider that the group might adjust their choices in the upcoming round, leading to a different average.",
        "61": "Fine-tune estimate: Based on these observations, a good estimate for the upcoming round would be around the middle of the recent averages range, i.e., around 5. However, be prepared to adjust the estimate based on the previous round's average and potential herding behavior.",
        "62": "Monitor the competition: Keep track of the other players' chosen numbers and adjust the strategy accordingly. If other players start choosing higher numbers, consider increasing the chosen number slightly while still keeping it below the calculated target number.",
        "63": "Avoid choosing numbers significantly higher than the group's average: In the past, you have won when your chosen number was close to the average.",
        "64": "Be cautious about choosing numbers significantly lower than the group's average: In some cases, this strategy has led to losses.",

        "72": "Identify the most recent average: The average number chosen in the last round was 7.",
        "73": "Estimate the new average: Since the trend has been increasing in the last few rounds, it's reasonable to expect the group's average to continue increasing. To estimate the new average, consider the slope of the increasing trend. In this case, the average increased by approximately 1.4 (from 5.6 to 7) in the last two rounds.",

        "79": "Evaluate the new target number: Compute the new target number (2/3 of the new average) and compare it to the chosen number in the previous round.",
        "80": "Adjust the chosen number: If the chosen number in the previous round was far from the new target number, adjust it to be closer to the new target. A more conservative approach would be to choose a number within 20% of the new target number.",
        "81": "Monitor the group's average trend: Keep track of the group's average trend over several rounds. If the average is fluctuating significantly, consider choosing a number closer to the median or mode of the group's choices to minimize the risk of being too far from the target number.",
        "82": "Communicate with other players: If there is an opportunity to communicate with other players, consider discussing the significant changes in the group's average and coordinating future choices to minimize the risk of being too far from the target number.",
        "83": "Consider the number of players: If there are fewer players in the upcoming rounds, the group's average might be affected. Adjust your strategy based on the number of players participating in the game.",
        "84": "Analyze opponent choices: Pay attention to the choices made by other players, especially those who have won in the past. This information might provide insights into their strategies and help you adjust your own approach.",
        "85": "Analyze the pattern of winning and losing: In 11 out of 14 rounds, choosing a number closer to the lower end of the range (3-6) resulted in winning. In 3 out of 14 rounds, choosing a number closer to the middle or higher end of the range (10, 12, or 24) resulted in losing.",
        "86": "Adjust the strategy to focus on lower numbers: Since choosing lower numbers has a higher success rate, focus on selecting numbers between 3 and 6.",
        "87": "Be cautious with significant changes: Avoid making drastic changes to the chosen number, as it may lead to losing the round. Stick to the 3-6 range and make small adjustments based on the group's average.",

        "91": "Consider the target number: Keep in mind that the target number is 2/3 of the group's average. As you adjust your strategy to be more in line with the group, ensure that your chosen numbers still have the potential to be close to the target number.",
        "92": "Communicate with other players: If there's an opportunity to discuss the game with other players, consider sharing your observations and strategies. This can help you better understand the group's thought process and inform your own decision-making.",
        "93": "Consider the risk of choosing a higher number: If the group's average is consistently higher than the target number, and you choose a number closer to the target number but still higher than your previous choices, there is a risk that the group's average may decrease further, making your chosen number less likely to be the winning number.",
        "94": "Observe changes in distribution over time: Analyze how the distribution of chosen numbers changes over the course of the game. This can help identify whether players are adjusting their strategies or if there are learning effects at play.",

In the last 5 rounds, you chose numbers that were on average 1.6 units away from the group's average. Try to reduce this gap by choosing numbers closer to the group's average.",
        "97": "Adapt to recent trends: Focus on the group's average in the last few rounds rather than the entire game log. The group's average has been relatively stable in the last 5 rounds, ranging from 3.2 to 12.2. Try to choose numbers within this range to increase your chances of winning.",
        "98": "Stay flexible with your range: Don't limit yourself to a narrow range of numbers. Be open to exploring a wider range to find the optimal number that is closest to the target.",

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Identify the threshold: Determine the threshold below which the chosen number is likely to be closer to the target number. In the past rounds, this threshold seems to be around 2.13 (the lowest target number).\n - Estimate the current average: Based on the previous pattern, estimate the current average number chosen by the players. It seems that the average might be around 6-7 in the upcoming rounds.\n - Stay Focused: Keep a clear mind and avoid being influenced by emotions or external factors that could negatively impact the decision-making process.\n - Focus on the lower end: Since the majority of the numbers chosen are in the lower end of the range, focus on selecting numbers closer to the minimum range (0) while ensuring they are still close to 2/3 of the estimated average.\n - Set a target range: Based on the estimated average and the risk level, set a target range of numbers that balance risk and reward. This range should ideally be close to the estimated average but also include higher numbers that could potentially result in a higher reward.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

        "1": "Identify the range of recent averages: The average numbers chosen in the last few rounds have ranged from 3.2 to 14.2. This wide range suggests that the group's mindset is fluctuating, and it may be challenging to predict the next average. However, focusing on this range can help narrow down the potential target number.",
        "2": "Observe the frequency of higher and lower averages: There have been more instances of lower averages (below 10) in the recent rounds than higher averages (above 10). This trend suggests that the group may be leaning towards lower numbers, and player_2 should consider choosing a number in the lower end of the range.",
        "3": "Consider the possibility of a shift in group dynamics: The group's mindset may be changing, as evidenced by the fluctuation in recent averages. Player_2 should be prepared for a potential shift in group dynamics and adjust their strategy accordingly.",
        "4": "Focus on winning when close to the target: If player_2's choice is close to the target number, they should prioritize winning the round over choosing a number that is mathematically closer to the target. For example, in Round 11, player_2 chose 4, which was closer to the target of 2.13 than the winning number of 3, but they still lost the round.",

        "13": "Determine if a consistent decreasing trend exists and adjust the chosen number accordingly: Based on the analysis, if a consistent decreasing trend exists, it's important to adjust the chosen number to adapt to the trend.",
        "14": "Identify fluctuations: Look for significant fluctuations in the average numbers chosen and target numbers. For example, in rounds 1-5, the average numbers chosen were relatively high, but in rounds 6-11, the averages were much lower. This indicates a significant fluctuation.",
        "15": "Evaluate the effectiveness of the current strategy: Assess whether the current strategy of choosing numbers close to the estimated target number is still effective. In this case, the strategy worked well in rounds 1, 2, 5, 6, and 14 but failed in the other rounds.",

        "18": "Analyze the average stability: Over the past 18 rounds, the average has fluctuated significantly. However, there are a few instances where the average has remained relatively stable for 3 or more consecutive rounds (e.g., Rounds 1-3, 11-13, and 15-17). Identify these periods and assess whether the average remains stable in the subsequent rounds.",
        "19": "Identify the target range: Calculate the target number (2/3 of the average) for the periods where the average has remained relatively stable. This will help you determine the target range for your number selection.",

To achieve the primary goal, consider the following guidelines: a. Focus on selecting numbers around 3 or 4, as they are close to the target number. b. Monitor the actual average number in the next round and adjust the strategy accordingly. c. Be prepared to adapt the strategy if the rate of decrease changes or if other players start choosing significantly different numbers. d. Continue to practice mental arithmetic skills to quickly calculate the average and estimate 2/3 of the average. e. Maintain emotional stability during the game to avoid making impulsive or irrational decisions based on fear, anxiety, or other emotional states.",

If the rate of decrease is increasing, consider selecting a narrower range of numbers closer to the target. If the rate of decrease is decreasing, consider selecting a wider range of numbers that includes higher values.",
        "35": "Communicate with other players: If there is an opportunity to communicate with other players, consider sharing information about the rate of decrease and coordinating future selections. This could involve agreeing to select higher or lower numbers based on the identified patterns and trends.",
        "36": "Manage time and emotions: Continue to allocate enough time to carefully consider the options and make an informed decision, without rushing or being pressured by the time limit. Maintain emotional stability during the game to avoid making impulsive or irrational decisions based on fear, anxiety, or other emotional states.",

        "42": "Set a personal target: Since the target number is 2/3 of the average, aim to choose a number that is 2/3 of the estimated average for the next round. For example, if the estimated average is around 5, then choose a number around 3.3 (2/3 of 5).",
        "43": "Evaluate risk: Since the trend is towards lower numbers, selecting a number close to the personal target may still result in a loss if the average chosen number decreases significantly. Consider choosing a number at the lower end of the range to minimize the risk of being too far from the target number.",
        "44": "Be prepared to switch strategies: If the trend reverses and the average chosen number starts increasing, be ready to switch strategies and consider selecting higher numbers.",
        "45": "Anticipate trend reversals: Although the trend has been downward, there is a possibility of a reversal. Monitor the game log for signs of an increasing average and adjust the strategy accordingly.",
        "46": "Maintain a safety margin: To avoid losing due to small fluctuations in the average, consider selecting a number slightly below the current average. This safety margin can help ensure that the chosen number remains close to the target number even if the average increases slightly.",
        "47": "Evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy: Regularly assess the success of the strategy based on the outcomes of each round. If the strategy is not leading to wins, consider making adjustments or trying a different approach.",

        "49": "Consider the impact of winning or losing: Winning or losing a round can influence the average chosen number in the next round. Be aware of this impact and adjust the strategy accordingly.",
        "50": "Stay vigilant for outliers: Although the majority of the averages are closer to 5.6, be prepared for occasional outliers where the average number is closer to 9. If an outlier occurs, consider whether it is a one-time event or part of a larger trend.",
        "51": "Monitor average fluctuations: Pay close attention to the average number chosen by all players, especially if it suddenly shifts outside the focused range.",
        "52": "Identify the cause: Try to determine the reason for the sudden shift in the average number. It could be due to a change in strategy by some players or a random fluctuation.",
        "53": "Evaluate risk: Assess the risk associated with the new range of potential target numbers. A more conservative approach may be necessary if the range is wide, while a more aggressive approach could be considered if the range is narrow.",
        "54": "Adapt the range: Based on the updated estimation and risk assessment, adjust the range of numbers to focus on for the next round.",
        "55": "Learn from the shift: Analyze the outcome of the round with the sudden shift to identify any patterns or trends that could inform future strategies in similar situations.",

        "57": "Observe the frequency of fluctuations: The average numbers seem to fluctuate quite often, with occasional decreases and increases. Pay close attention to these fluctuations to determine if there is a pattern.",
        "58": "Analyze the magnitude of change: Calculate the difference in the average number chosen between consecutive rounds. A significant change could be identified if the difference is greater than a predefined threshold (e.g., 5).",
        "59": "Monitor the frequency of extreme values: Keep track of rounds with extreme high or low average numbers. A significant change could be identified if the average number returns to a value closer to the historical average after an extreme round.",
        "60": "Analyze consecutive changes: Look for patterns in consecutive changes, such as a series of significant changes followed by a series of minor changes. This could provide insights into how the other players are adapting their strategies over time.",
        "61": "Compare average numbers with winning numbers: Analyze the relationship between the average number and the winning number in each round. If the winning number is consistently close to the average number, it could suggest that the other players are trying to match the average number. Conversely, if the winning number is consistently lower or higher than the average number, it could indicate that the other players are employing a different strategy.",
        "62": "Observe patterns in your own choices: Reflect on how your choices have contributed to the magnitude of changes in average numbers. If your choices have been consistently close to the target number, it could encourage other players to adjust their strategies accordingly. Conversely, if your choices have been far from the target number, it could prompt other players to change their strategies in response.",
        "63": "Determine if there is a stabilization point: Although the averages fluctuate, they seem to stabilize around the 5 to 6 range towards the end of the game log. Consider focusing on this range to identify a pattern or trend.",
        "64": "Analyze the pattern: Observe the relationship between your chosen numbers and the winning numbers. In the past 14 rounds, you have won 4 times and lost 10 times. Your chosen numbers have been consistently higher than the winning numbers in most of the losing rounds.",
        "65": "Identify the range: Based on the game log, the average chosen number in the 14 rounds is approximately 8.5, and the target number (2/3 of the average) is around 5.67. Consider this range when adjusting your strategy.",

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Stay close to the estimated target number: In 10 out of 11 rounds where player_3 chose a number closer to the estimated target number, they won. The only exception was in Round 13, where the average number chosen was significantly higher than in previous rounds.\n - Observe the estimated average trend: Over the last few rounds, the estimated average has been fluctuating between low and high numbers. However, there seems to be a slight downward trend in the estimated average in the most recent rounds (rounds 16-19).\n - Adapt to the downward trend: Since the estimated average appears to be decreasing, consider choosing lower numbers to increase the chances of being closer to the target number.\n - Stay within the range: In most rounds, Player_3 has chosen numbers within the range of numbers selected by other players. This strategy has led to wins in several rounds. Therefore, it is advisable to continue choosing numbers within the observed range.\n - Be cautious with high winning numbers: In rounds where Player_3 has won with high numbers (e.g., Round 1: 35, Round 3: 13, Round 6: 5), it has led to losses in the subsequent rounds. To avoid consecutive losses, Player_3 should consider choosing a number closer to the average or the middle of the range after winning with a high number.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "

In this game log, there are only two instances of such deviations: Round 2: Winning number is 20, target number is 17.60 (deviation of 2.4) Round 13: Winning number is 4, target number is 8.13 (deviation of -4.13) In both cases, the winning number is lower than the target number. Consider this pattern when making your decisions.",

        "43": "Be prepared to switch strategies: If the deviation fluctuates between positive and negative values, be prepared to switch strategies between rounds to minimize the risk of choosing a number too far from the target.",
        "44": "Maintain proximity to the target: While adjusting to the average, ensure that your choice remains close to the target number. This will increase the chances of winning in case other players' choices also deviate significantly from the average.",

        "52": "Don't overreact to a single round: The target number can fluctuate, and a single round's result should not significantly impact your strategy. Instead, focus on the overall trend and adjust your approach based on that.",
        "53": "Stay patient and persistent: Winning this game requires patience and persistence. Stick to your strategy, and don't get discouraged by a few lost rounds. Keep monitoring the target number and adjust your approach as needed.",
        "54": "Avoid extreme numbers: In some instances, choosing numbers too close to the extreme ends of the range led to losing. For example, in rounds 9 and 15, choosing 14 and 9, respectively, resulted in losing, even though they were close to the average.",
        "55": "Be cautious with high averages: When the average is high (above 10), consider choosing numbers closer to the average. In the first 5 rounds, the winning number was always the average or close to it.",
        "56": "Avoid extreme choices: To minimize the risk of losing, avoid making extreme choices and stick to numbers close to the average.",
        "57": "Consider the distribution of choices: In some rounds, the average number chosen is skewed towards higher or lower numbers. In such cases, consider choosing a number closer to the skewed average to increase winning chances.",
        "58": "Stay vigilant for outliers: Be prepared to recognize and adapt to situations where the winning number is an outlier, significantly lower than the average number chosen.",

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\n\nHere are some sub-goals and guidance derived from your primary goal: \n - Monitor the game over time to identify any long-term trends or patterns: If there are consistent patterns or trends in the game, it may be possible to predict potential spikes and adjust the strategy accordingly.\n - Balance between spike anticipation and trend following: While anticipating spikes is important, don't ignore the overall trend. If the average number chosen is consistently decreasing or increasing, adjust the strategy accordingly, even if there are no spikes.\n - Adapt to the situation: If the chosen number in the previous round was too far from the target number, adjust the strategy accordingly. If the chosen number was too high, consider choosing a number closer to 3.5 in the next round. If the chosen number was too low, consider choosing a number closer to 4.5.\n - Determine the target range: If the trend is increasing, and the average is, for instance, between 20 and 30, the refined range could be (26.67, 33.33) since the target number would be around 2/3 of the average.\n - Stay flexible: While the refined range of 3 to 4 is a good starting point, remain open to adjusting it if there is evidence that another range might be more effective. Continuously monitor the game log and other players' behaviors to inform any necessary adjustments.\n\nIn this round, You should try to improve your game strategy based on these guidance, in order to achieve your primary objective.\n "
