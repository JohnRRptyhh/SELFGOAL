After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nLearnings:\n- 1. Choosing the average number MAY BE NECESSARY to increase the chances of selecting a number close to the target number.\n2. Selecting a higher number MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning if other players choose lower numbers, causing a higher average and a lower target number.\n3. Choosing an extremely high or low number DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE to winning, as it is unlikely to be the closest to the target number.\n4. Considering the range of numbers chosen by other players MAY BE NECESSARY to adjust your strategy and select a number closer to the target.\n5. Aiming for a number around 2/3 of the maximum possible average (67) MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to winning, as it ensures a higher chance of being closer to the target number than the majority of the range.\n6. Adapting your strategy based on the outcomes of previous rounds MAY BE NECESSARY to improve your chances of winning in future rounds.\n7. Avoiding numbers already chosen by other players MAY BE CONTRIBUTIVE to increasing the likelihood of selecting a unique number and potentially being closer to the target number.\n8. Calculating the target number before making a selection MAY BE NECESSARY to make a more informed decision and increase the chances of winning.\nLearnings:\n- 1.

After all selections are made, the average of all chosen numbers is calculated.\n3. The target number is 2/3 of this average.\n4. The winner is the player(s) who selected a number closest to the target number.\n\nRemember, Your goal is to choose a number that you believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen by players, including your selection.\n\nHere are your key learning points and practical tips from previous game rounds. You can use them to guide this round:\n```\nLearnings:\n- 1. Choosing the average number MAY BE NECESSARY to increase the chances of selecting a number close to the target number.\n2.

Striving for consistency in strategy while being mindful of the evolving game context may contribute to long-term success in the game.\n16. Reflecting on the historical data, it is evident that the target number tends to be lower than the average chosen number. Therefore, considering a slightly lower number than the calculated average may increase the chances of winning.\n17. Analyzing the distribution of chosen numbers (e.g., mean, median, mode) can help inform a more data-driven approach to selecting a number.\n18. Flexibility in strategy may be necessary to adapt to the varying game conditions and other players' behaviors.\n19.

Choosing a number close to the calculated average may be necessary to increase the chances of selecting a number close to the target number.\n2. Selecting a higher number may contribute to winning if other players choose lower numbers, causing a higher average and a lower target number.\n3. Choosing an extremely high or low number does not contribute to winning, as it is unlikely to be the closest to the target number.\n4. Considering the other players' strategies may be necessary to adjust and improve one's own strategy.\n5. Aiming for a number around 2/3 of the previous round's average or median may contribute to winning, as it is a potential target number for the current round.\n6. Being aware of the game rules and the method of calculating the target number should be necessary to make informed decisions and increase the chances of winning.\n7. Avoiding numbers that are too far from the average may contribute to winning, as it increases the likelihood of being closer to the target number.\n8.
